######## (C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and paragraph (1)(B), a new 121 mainline passenger carrier, otherwise qualified under this subsection, may immediately receive equitable tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail to a hub point in the State of Alaska if the carrier meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) and subsection (h)(2)(B) and

(i) all qualified 121 mainline passenger carriers discontinue service on the city pair route; or

(ii) no 121 mainline passenger carrier serves the city pair route.

(D) A carrier operating under a code share agreement on the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002 that received tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail on a city pair route in the State of Alaska may count the passenger service provided under the entire code share arrangement on such route if the code share agreement terminates. That carrier shall continue to provide at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as determined for bush passenger carriers in subsection (h)(5)) between the city pair as a 121 mainline passenger carrier while seeking such tender.

(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), passenger carriers providing essential air service under a Department of Transportation order issued under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, shall be tendered all nonpriority mail, in addition to all nonpriority bypass mail, by the Postal Service to destination cities in the State of Alaska served by the essential air service flights consistent with that order unless the Postal Service finds that an essential air service carrier’s service does not meet the needs of the Postal Service.

(B) Service provided under this paragraph, including service provided to points served in conjunction with service being subsidized under the Essential Air Service contract, may not be applied toward any of the minimum eligibility requirements of this section.

(A) meet the requirements of subsection (g)(1);

(B) provided 20 percent or more of the passenger service (as calculated in paragraph (5)) between the city pair for the 12 months preceding the date on which the 121 passenger aircraft or the 135 passenger carrier seek tender of nonpriority bypass mail; and

(C) meet the requirements of paragraph (2).

(2) To remain eligible for equitable tender under this subsection, the carrier or aircraft shall

(A) continue to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair route for which the carrier is seeking the tender of such nonpriority bypass mail;

(B)

(i) for operations under part 121, operate aircraft type certificated to carry at least 19 passengers;

(ii) for operations under part 135, operate aircraft type certificated to carry at least 5 passengers; or

(iii) for operations under part 135 where only a water landing is available, operate aircraft type certificated to carry at least 3 passengers;
