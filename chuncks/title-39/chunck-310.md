### CHAPTER 54— TRANSPORTATION OF MAIL BY AIR
#### § 5402. Contracts for transportation of mail by air
###### (c) Good Faith Effort Required .
######## (C) The Postal Service, after consultation with affected carriers, may establish for service by aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(II)

(i) a larger number of flights than required under subparagraph (B)(i); or

(ii) the days that service will operate.

(2) The Postal Service

(A) may provide direct mainline non-priority bypass mail service to any bush point in the State of Alaska, without regard to paragraph (1)(B), if such service is equal to or better than interline service in cost and quality;

(B) shall deduct the non-priority bypass mail poundage flown on direct mainline flights to bush points within the State of Alaska by any carrier, from such carrier’s allocation of the total poundage of non-priority bypass mail transported to the nearest appropriate Postal Service hub point in any month;

(C) shall offer a bush passenger carrier providing service on a route in the State of Alaska between an acceptance point and a hub not served by a mainline carrier the opportunity to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail at mainline service rates when a mainline carrier begins serving that route if the bush passenger carrier

(i) meets the requirements of paragraph (1);

(ii) provided at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as calculated in subsection (h)(5)) between such city pair for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the bush carrier seeks such tender; and

(iii) continues to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair while seeking such tender;

(D) shall offer bush passenger carriers and nonmail freight carriers the opportunity to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail at mainline service rates from a hub point to a destination city in the State of Alaska if the city pair is also being served by a mainline carrier and

(i) for a passenger carrier

(I) the carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1);

(II) the carrier provided at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as calculated in subsection (h)(5)) on the city pair route for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks such tender; and

(III) the carrier continues to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the route; or

(ii) for a nonmail freight carrier

(I) the carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1); and

(II) the carrier provided at least 25 percent of the nonmail freight service (as calculated in subsection (i)(6)) on the city pair route for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks such tender;

(E)

(i) shall not offer equitable tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail at mainline rates to a bush carrier operating from an acceptance point to a hub point in the State of Alaska, except as described in subparagraph (C); and

(ii) may tender nonpriority bypass mail at bush rates to a bush carrier from an acceptance point to a hub point in the State of Alaska if the Postal Service determines that

(I) the bush carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1);

(II) the service to be provided on such route by the bush carrier is not otherwise available through direct mainline service; and

(III) tender of mail to such bush carrier will not decrease the efficiency of nonpriority bypass mail service (in terms of payments to all carriers providing service on the city pair route and timely delivery) for the route;

(F) may offer tender of nonpriority bypass mail to a passenger carrier from an acceptance point to a destination city beyond a hub point in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if the Postal Service determines that

(i) the carrier provides passenger service in accordance with the requirements of subsection (h)(2);

(ii) the carrier qualifies under subsection (h) to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail out of the hub point being bypassed;

(iii) the tender of such mail will not decrease efficiency of delivery of nonpriority bypass mail service into or out of the hub point being bypassed; and

(iv) such tender will result in reduced payments to the carrier by the Postal Service over flying the entire route; and

(G) notwithstanding subparagraph (F), shall offer equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail in proportion to passenger and nonmail freight mail pools described in this section between qualified passenger and nonmail freight carriers on a route from an acceptance point to a bush destination in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if

(i)

(I) for a passenger carrier, the carrier receiving the composite rate provided 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair route for the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail; or

(II) for a nonmail freight carrier, the carrier receiving the composite rate provided at least 25 percent of the nonmail freight service for the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail; and

(ii)

(I) nonpriority bypass mail was being tendered to a passenger carrier or a nonmail freight carrier at a composite rate on such city pair route on January 1, 2000 ; or

(II) the hub being bypassed was not served by a mainline carrier on January 1, 2000 . The tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subparagraph (G) shall be on an equitable basis between the qualified carriers that provide the direct service on the city pair route and the qualified carriers that provide service between the hub point being bypassed and the destination point, based on the volume of nonpriority bypass mail on both routes.

(3)

(A) The Postal Service shall determine the bypass mail bush points and hub points described under paragraph (2)(B) after consultation with the State of Alaska and the affected local communities and air carriers.
