### CHAPTER 54— TRANSPORTATION OF MAIL BY AIR
#### § 5402. Contracts for transportation of mail by air
###### (b) International Mail.

(1) In general.

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Postal Service may contract for the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points in foreign air transportation only with certificated air carriers. A contract may be awarded to a certificated air carrier to transport mail by air between any of the points in foreign air transportation that the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers.

(B) If the Postal Service has sought offers or proposals from certificated air carriers to transport mail in foreign air transportation between points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, and has not received offers or proposals that meet Postal Service requirements at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 such carriers, the Postal Service may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the Postal Service’s requirements is unavailable at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 certificated air carriers, either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers, the Postal Service may contract with foreign air carriers to provide the service sought if, when the Postal Service seeks offers or proposals from foreign air carriers, it also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that service from any certificated air carrier providing service between those points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, on the same terms and conditions that are being sought from foreign air carriers.

(C) For purposes of this subsection, the Postal Service shall use a methodology for determining fair and reasonable prices for the Postal Service designated region or regions developed in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest.

(D) For purposes of this subsection, ceiling prices determined pursuant to the methodology used under subparagraph (C) shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable if they do not exceed the ceiling prices derived from

(i) a weighted average based on market rate data furnished by the International Air Transport Association or a subsidiary unit thereof; or

(ii) if such data are not available from those sources, such other neutral, regularly updated set of weighted average market rates as the Postal Service, with the concurrence of certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest, may designate.

(E) If, for purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), concurrence cannot be attained, then the most recently available market rate data described in this subparagraph shall continue to apply for the relevant market or markets.

(2) Contract process .

The Postal Service shall contract for foreign air transportation as set forth in paragraph (1) through an open procurement process that will provide

(A) potential offerors with timely notice of business opportunities in sufficient detail to allow them to make a proposal;

(B) requirements, proposed terms and conditions, and evaluation criteria to potential offerors; and

(C) an opportunity for unsuccessful offerors to receive prompt feedback upon request.

(3) Emergency or unanticipated conditions; inadequate lift space .

The Postal Service may enter into contracts to transport mail by air in foreign air transportation with a certificated air carrier or a foreign air carrier without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) if

(A) emergency or unanticipated conditions exist that make it impractical for the Postal Service to comply with such requirements; or

(B) its demand for lift exceeds the space available to it under existing contracts and

(i) there is insufficient time available to seek additional lift using procedures that comply with those requirements without compromising the Postal Service’s service commitments to its own customers; and

(ii) the Postal Service first offers any certificated air carrier holding a contract to carry mail between the relevant points the opportunity to carry such excess volumes under the terms of its existing contract.
