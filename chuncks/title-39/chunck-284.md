### CHAPTER 37— NONPOSTAL SERVICES
#### § 3703. Postal Service program for State governments
###### (a) In General .

Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Postal Service may establish a program to enter into agreements with an agency of any State government, local government, or tribal government to provide property or nonpostal services to the public on behalf of such agencies for non-commercial purposes, but only if

(1) such property or nonpostal services

(A) provide enhanced value to the public, such as by lowering the cost or raising the quality of such services or by making such services more accessible;

(B) do not interfere with or detract from the value of postal services, including by

(i) harming the cost and efficiency of postal services; and

(ii) unreasonably restricting access to postal retail service, such as customer waiting time and access to parking; and

(2) such agreements provide a net contribution to the Postal Service, defined as reimbursement that covers at least 100 percent of the costs attributable to all property and nonpostal services provided under each relevant agreement in each year, except that agreements determined to be substantially similar by the Postal Service with the concurrence of the Postal Regulatory Commission shall be reviewed based on their collective revenue and costs attributable.
