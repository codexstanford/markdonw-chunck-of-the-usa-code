###### (c) Special Rule for Possessory Interest Existing Before November 13, 1998.

(1) In general .

A concessioner that has obtained a possessory interest (as defined pursuant to the Act of October 9, 1965 (known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; Public Law 89–249 , 79 Stat. 969 ), as in effect on November 12, 1998 ) under the terms of a concession contract entered into before November 13, 1998 , shall, on the expiration or termination of the concession contract, be entitled to receive compensation for the possessory interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by the concession contract. Where that possessory interest is not described in the existing concession contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on November 12, 1998 .

(2) Existing concessioner awarded a new contract .

A concessioner awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession contract after November 13, 1998 , instead of directly receiving the possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.

(3) New concessioner awarded a contract .

A new concessioner awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements. The initial value in the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract.

(4) De novo review of value determination .

If the Secretary, or either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998 , considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the determination decision.
