### CHAPTER 2005— URBAN PARK AND RECREATION RECOVERY PROGRAM
#### § 200504. Recovery action programs
###### (a) Evidence of Local Commitment to Ongoing Programs .

As a requirement for project approval, local governments applying for assistance under this chapter shall submit to the Secretary evidence of their commitments to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for their park and recreation systems. These commitments will be expressed in local park and recreation recovery action programs that maximize coordination of all community resources, including other federally supported urban development and recreation programs. During an initial interim period to be established by regulations under this chapter, this requirement may be satisfied by local government submissions of preliminary action programs that briefly define objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies for overall system recovery and maintenance and commit the applicant to a scheduled program development process. Following this interim period, all local applicants shall submit to the Secretary, as a condition of eligibility, a 5-year action program for park and recreation recovery that satisfactorily demonstrates

(1) systematic identification of recovery objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies;

(2) adequate planning for rehabilitation of specific recreation areas and facilities, including projections of the cost of proposed projects;

(3) the capacity and commitment to ensure that facilities provided or improved under this chapter shall continue to be adequately maintained, protected, staffed, and supervised;

(4) the intention to maintain total local public outlays for park and recreation purposes at levels at least equal to those in the year preceding that in which grant assistance is sought except in any case where a reduction in park and recreation outlays is proportionate to a reduction in overall spending by the applicant; and

(5) the relationship of the park and recreation recovery program to overall community development and urban revitalization efforts.
