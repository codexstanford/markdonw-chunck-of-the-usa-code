(A) make minor changes to the boundary of the System unit, and amounts appropriated from the Fund shall be available for acquisition of any land, water, and interests in land or water added to the System unit by the boundary change subject to such statutory limitations, if any, on methods of acquisition and appropriations thereof as may be specifically applicable to the System unit; and

(B) acquire by donation, purchase with donated funds, transfer from any other Federal agency, or exchange, land, water, or interests in land or water adjacent to the System unit, except that in exercising the Secretary’s authority under this subparagraph the Secretary

(ii) shall not acquire property without the consent of the owner; and

(iii) may acquire property owned by a State or political subdivision of a State only by donation.

(D) The proposed boundary change is not an element of a more comprehensive boundary change proposal.

(E) The proposed boundary has been subject to a public review and comment period.

(F) The Director obtains written consent for the boundary change from all property owners whose land, water, or interests in land or water, or a portion of whose land, water, or interests in land or water, will be added to or deleted from the System unit by the boundary change.

(G) The land abuts other Federal land administered by the Director.
