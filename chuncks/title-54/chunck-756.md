###### (a) Survey .

The Secretary may conduct a survey of sites that the Secretary considers exhibit qualities most appropriate for the commemoration of each former President. The survey may

(2) identify sites or structures historically unrelated to a former President but that may be suitable as a memorial to honor that President.
