#### § 172. Wildlife-vehicle collision reduction and habitat connectivity improvement
###### (a) Study.

(1) In general .

The Secretary shall conduct a study (referred to in this subsection as the “study”) of the state, as of the date of the study, of the practice of methods to reduce collisions between motorists and wildlife (referred to in this section as “wildlife-vehicle collisions”).

(2) Contents.

(A) Areas of study .

The study shall

(i) update and expand on, as appropriate

(I) the report entitled “Wildlife Vehicle Collision Reduction Study: 2008 Report to Congress”; and

(II) the document entitled “Wildlife Vehicle Collision Reduction Study: Best Practices Manual” and dated October 2008; and

(ii) include

(I) an assessment, as of the date of the study, of

(aa) the causes of wildlife-vehicle collisions;

(bb) the impact of wildlife-vehicle collisions on motorists and wildlife; and

(cc) the impacts of roads and traffic on habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species; and

(II) solutions and best practices for

(aa) reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(bb) improving habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species.

(B) Methods .

In carrying out the study, the Secretary shall

(i) conduct a thorough review of research and data relating to

(I) wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(II) habitat fragmentation that results from transportation infrastructure;

(ii) survey current practices of the Department of Transportation and State departments of transportation to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(iii) consult with

(I) appropriate experts in the field of wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(II) appropriate experts on the effects of roads and traffic on habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species.

(3) Report.

(A) In general .

Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the study.

(B) Contents .

The report under subparagraph (A) shall include

(i) a description of

(I) the causes of wildlife-vehicle collisions;

(II) the impacts of wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(III) the impacts of roads and traffic on

(aa) species listed as threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);

(bb) species identified by States as species of greatest conservation need;

(cc) species identified in State wildlife plans; and

(dd) medium and small terrestrial and aquatic species;

(ii) an economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of installing highway infrastructure and other measures to mitigate damage to terrestrial and aquatic species, including the effect on jobs, property values, and economic growth to society, adjacent communities, and landowners;

(iii) recommendations for preventing wildlife-vehicle collisions, including recommended best practices, funding resources, or other recommendations for addressing wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(iv) guidance, developed in consultation with Federal land management agencies and State departments of transportation, State fish and wildlife agencies, and Tribal governments that agree to participate, for developing, for each State that agrees to participate, a voluntary joint statewide transportation and wildlife action plan

(I) to address wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(II) to improve habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species.
