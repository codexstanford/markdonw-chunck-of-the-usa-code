### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 148. Highway safety improvement program
###### (c) Eligibility.

(1) In general .

To obligate funds apportioned under section 104(b)(3) to carry out this section, a State shall have in effect a State highway safety improvement program under which the State

(A) develops, implements, and updates a State strategic highway safety plan that identifies and analyzes highway safety problems and opportunities as provided in subsections (a)(13) and (d);

(B) produces a program of projects or strategies to reduce identified safety problems; and

(C) evaluates the strategic highway safety plan on a regularly recurring basis in accordance with subsection (d)(1) to ensure the accuracy of the data and priority of proposed strategies.

(2) Identification and analysis of highway safety problems and opportunities .

As part of the State highway safety improvement program, a State shall

(A) have in place a safety data system with the ability to perform safety problem identification and countermeasure analysis

(i) to improve the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, uniformity, integration, and accessibility of the safety data on all public roads, including non-State-owned public roads and roads on tribal land in the State;

(ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of data improvement efforts;

(iii) to link State data systems, including traffic records, with other data systems within the State;

(iv) to improve the compatibility and interoperability of safety data with other State transportation-related data systems and the compatibility and interoperability of State safety data systems with data systems of other States and national data systems;

(v) to enhance the ability of the Secretary to observe and analyze national trends in crash occurrences, rates, outcomes, and circumstances; and

(vi) to improve the collection of data on nonmotorized crashes and to differentiate the safety data for vulnerable road users, including bicyclists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians, from other road users;

(B) based on the analysis required by subparagraph (A)

(i) identify hazardous locations, sections, and elements (including roadside obstacles, railway-highway crossing needs, and unmarked or poorly marked roads) that constitute a danger to motorists, vulnerable road users (including motorcyclists, bicyclists, pedestrians), and other highway users;

(ii) using such criteria as the State determines to be appropriate, establish the relative severity of those locations, in terms of crashes (including crash rates), fatalities, serious injuries, traffic volume levels, and other relevant data;

(iii) identify the number of fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads by location in the State;

(iv) identify highway safety improvement projects on the basis of crash experience, crash potential, crash rate, or other data-supported means; and

(v) consider which projects maximize opportunities to advance safety;

(C) adopt strategic and performance-based goals that

(i) address traffic safety, including behavioral and infrastructure problems and opportunities on all public roads;

(ii) focus resources on areas of greatest need; and

(iii) are coordinated with other State highway safety programs;

(D) advance the capabilities of the State for safety data collection, analysis, and integration in a manner that

(i) complements the State highway safety program under chapter 4 and the commercial vehicle safety plan under section 31102 of title 49 ;

(ii) includes all public roads, including public non-State-owned roads and roads on tribal land;

(iii) identifies hazardous locations, sections, and elements on all public roads that constitute a danger to motorists (including motorcyclists), bicyclists, pedestrians, persons with disabilities, and other highway users;

(iv) includes a means of identifying the relative severity of hazardous locations described in clause (iii) in terms of crashes (including crash rate), serious injuries, fatalities, and traffic volume levels;

(v) improves the ability of the State to identify the number of fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads in the State with a breakdown by functional classification and ownership in the State; and

(vi) improves the ability of the State to differentiate the fatalities and serious injuries of vulnerable road users, including bicyclists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians, from other road users;

(E)

(i) determine priorities for the correction of hazardous road locations, sections, and elements (including railway-highway crossing improvements), as identified through safety data analysis;

(ii) identify opportunities for preventing the development of such hazardous conditions; and

(iii) establish and implement a schedule of highway safety improvement projects for hazard correction and hazard prevention; and

(F)

(i) establish an evaluation process to analyze and assess results achieved by highway safety improvement projects carried out in accordance with procedures and criteria established by this section; and

(ii) use the information obtained under clause (i) in setting priorities for highway safety improvement projects.
