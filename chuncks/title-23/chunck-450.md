(bb) prioritized the project on that resilience improvement plan; and

(II) in the case of an eligible entity not described in subclause (I), the eligible entity is located in a State or an area served by a metropolitan planning organization that has

(aa) developed a resilience improvement plan in accordance with this subsection; and

(A) shall be for the immediate and long-range planning activities and investments of the State or metropolitan planning organization with respect to resilience of the surface transportation system within the boundaries of the State or metropolitan planning organization, as applicable;

(B) shall demonstrate a systemic approach to surface transportation system resilience and be consistent with and complementary of the State and local mitigation plans required under section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5165 );

(C) shall include a risk-based assessment of vulnerabilities of transportation assets and systems to current and future weather events and natural disasters, such as severe storms, flooding, drought, levee and dam failures, wildfire, rockslides, mudslides, sea level rise, extreme weather, including extreme temperatures, and earthquakes;

(D) may

(i) designate evacuation routes and strategies, including multimodal facilities, designated with consideration for individuals without access to personal vehicles;

(iv) include an investment plan that

(I) includes a list of priority projects; and

(II) describes how funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(8) or provided by a grant under the program would be invested and matched, which shall not be subject to fiscal constraint requirements; and

(ii) describe the codes, standards, and regulatory framework, if any, adopted and enforced to ensure resilience improvements within the impacted area of proposed projects included in the resilience improvement plan;

(iii) consider the benefits of combining hard surface transportation assets, and natural infrastructure, through coordinated efforts by the Federal Government and the States;

(iv) assess the resilience of other community assets, including buildings and housing, emergency management assets, and energy, water, and communication infrastructure;

(vi) include such other information as the State or metropolitan planning organization considers appropriate.

(3) No new planning requirements .
