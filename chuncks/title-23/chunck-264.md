#### § 144. National bridge and tunnel inventory and inspection standards
###### (b) National Bridge and Tunnel Inventories .

The Secretary, in consultation with the States and Federal agencies with jurisdiction over highway bridges and tunnels, shall

(1) inventory all highway bridges on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned bridges, that are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads;

(2) inventory all tunnels on public roads, on and off Federal-aid highways, including tribally owned and Federally owned tunnels;

(3) classify the bridges according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, including the potential impacts to emergency evacuation routes and to regional and national freight and passenger mobility if the serviceability of the bridge is restricted or diminished;

(4) based on that classification, assign each a risk-based priority for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation;

(5) determine the cost of replacing each bridge classified as in poor condition identified under this subsection with a comparable facility or the cost of rehabilitating the bridge; and

(6) determine if the replacement or rehabilitation of bridges and tunnels should include measures to enable safe and unimpeded movement for terrestrial and aquatic species.
