(B) First fiscal year .

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for the first fiscal year for which funds are made available for obligation for grants under the program, the Secretary may establish a date by which an eligible entity submitting an application for a large project shall submit to the Secretary such information as the Secretary may require, including information described in paragraph (2), in order for a large project to be considered for immediate execution of a grant agreement.

(2) Information required .

The information referred to in paragraph (1) includes

(A) all necessary information required for the Secretary to evaluate the large project; and

To be considered justified and receive a recommendation for funding in the annual report under paragraph (6), a project shall receive a rating of not less than “medium” for each rating required under subparagraph (A).

In the first fiscal year for which funds are made available for obligation for grants under the program, the Secretary may establish an interim methodology to evaluate and rate a large project for each of

(i) paragraph (4)(B);

(ii) paragraph (4)(C); and

(iii) paragraph (4)(D).

(6) Annual report on funding recommendations for large projects.

(B) Limitations.

(i) In general .

The Secretary shall not recommend in an annual report under this paragraph a new multiyear grant agreement provided from funds from the Highway Trust Fund unless the Secretary determines that the project can be completed using funds that are anticipated to be available from the Highway Trust Fund in future fiscal years.

(ii) General fund projects .

The Secretary

(I) may recommend for funding in an annual report under this paragraph a large project using funds from the general fund of the Treasury; but
