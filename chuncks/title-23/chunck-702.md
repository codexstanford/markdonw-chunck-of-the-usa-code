#### § 510. Future strategic highway research program
###### (c) Program Priorities.

(1) Program elements .

The program established under this section shall be based on the National Research Council Special Report 260, entitled “Strategic Highway Research: Saving Lives, Reducing Congestion, Improving Quality of Life” and the results of the detailed planning work subsequently carried out in 2002 and 2003 to identify the research areas through National Cooperative Research Program Project 20–58. The research program shall include an analysis of the following:

(A) Renewal of aging highway infrastructure with minimal impact to users of the facilities.

(B) Driving behavior and likely crash causal factors to support improved countermeasures.

(C) Reducing highway congestion due to nonrecurring congestion.

(D) Planning and designing new road capacity to meet mobility, economic, environmental, and community needs.

(2) Dissemination of results .

The research results of the program, expressed in terms of technologies, methodologies, and other appropriate categorizations, shall be disseminated to practicing engineers for their use, as soon as practicable.
