###### (e) Considerations .

In selecting grant recipients under the pilot program, the Secretary shall take into consideration the following:

(A) Leveraging Federal investment by encouraging non-Federal contributions to the project, including projects from public-private partnerships.

(B) Supporting local economic development and improvement of visitation opportunities.

(C) Incorporation of innovative technologies, including advanced design techniques and other strategies to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions and improving habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species.

(D) Provision of educational and outreach opportunities.

(E) Monitoring and research to evaluate, compare effectiveness of, and identify best practices in, selected projects.

(F) Any other criteria relevant to reducing the number of wildlife-vehicle collisions and improving habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, subject to the condition that the implementation of the pilot program shall not be delayed in the absence of action by the Secretary to identify additional criteria under this subparagraph.
