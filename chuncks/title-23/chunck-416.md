### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 172. Wildlife-vehicle collision reduction and habitat connectivity improvement
###### (c) Standardization of Wildlife Collision and Carcass Data.

(1) Standardized methodology.

(A) In general .

The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (referred to in this subsection as the “Secretary”), shall develop a quality standardized methodology for collecting and reporting spatially accurate wildlife collision and carcass data for the National Highway System, considering the practicability of the methodology with respect to technology and cost.

(B) Methodology .

In developing the standardized methodology under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall

(i) survey existing methodologies and sources of data collection, including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, the General Estimates System of the National Automotive Sampling System, and the Highway Safety Information System; and

(ii) to the extent practicable, identify and correct limitations of those existing methodologies and sources of data collection.

(C) Consultation .

In developing the standardized methodology under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consult with

(i) the Secretary of the Interior;

(ii) the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service;

(iii) Tribal, State, and local transportation and wildlife authorities;

(iv) metropolitan planning organizations (as defined in section 134(b));

(v) members of the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials;

(vi) members of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies;

(vii) experts in the field of wildlife-vehicle collisions;

(viii) nongovernmental organizations; and

(ix) other interested stakeholders, as appropriate.

(2) Standardized national data system with voluntary template implementation .

The Secretary shall

(A) develop a template for State implementation of a standardized national wildlife collision and carcass data system for the National Highway System that is based on the standardized methodology developed under paragraph (1); and

(B) encourage the voluntary implementation of the template developed under subparagraph (A).

(3) Reports.

(A) Methodology .

The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing the standardized methodology developed under paragraph (1) not later than the later of

(i) the date that is 18 months after the date of enactment of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021; and

(ii) the date that is 180 days after the date on which the Secretary completes the development of the standardized methodology.

(B) Implementation .

Not later than 4 years after the date of enactment of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing

(i) the status of the voluntary implementation of the standardized methodology developed under paragraph (1) and the template developed under paragraph (2)(A);

(ii) whether the implementation of the standardized methodology developed under paragraph (1) and the template developed under paragraph (2)(A) has impacted efforts by States, units of local government, and other entities

(I) to reduce the number of wildlife-vehicle collisions; and

(II) to improve habitat connectivity;

(iii) the degree of the impact described in clause (ii); and

(iv) the recommendations of the Secretary, including recommendations for further study aimed at reducing motorist collisions involving wildlife and improving habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species on the National Highway System, if any.
