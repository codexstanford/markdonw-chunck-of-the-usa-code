(B) in the case of any other eligible project, not more than 80 percent.

(4) Federal share.

(A) Maximum federal involvement .

Federal assistance other than a grant under the program may be used to satisfy the non-Federal share of the cost of a project for which a grant is made, except that the total Federal assistance provided for a project receiving a grant under the program may not exceed the Federal share for the project under section 120.

(B) Off-system bridges .

In the case of an eligible project for an off-system bridge (as defined in section 133(f)(1))

(i) Federal assistance other than a grant under the program may be used to satisfy the non-Federal share of the cost of a project; and

(ii) notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the total Federal assistance provided for the project shall not exceed 90 percent of the total eligible project costs.

(C) Federal land management agencies and tribal governments .

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Federal funds other than Federal funds made available under this section may be used to pay the remaining share of the cost of a project under the program by a Federal land management agency or a Tribal government or consortium of Tribal governments.

(5) Considerations.

(A) In general .

In awarding grants under the program, the Secretary shall consider

(i) in the case of a large project, the ratings assigned under subsection (g)(5)(A);

(ii) in the case of an eligible project other than a large project, the quality rating assigned under subsection (f)(3)(A)(ii);

(iii) the average daily person and freight throughput supported by the eligible project;

(iv) the number and percentage of bridges within the same State as the eligible project that are in poor condition;

(v) the extent to which the eligible project demonstrates cost savings by bundling multiple bridge projects;

(vi) in the case of an eligible project of a Federal land management agency, the extent to which the grant would reduce a Federal liability or Federal infrastructure maintenance backlog;

(vii) geographic diversity among grant recipients, including the need for a balance between the needs of rural and urban communities; and

(viii) the extent to which a bridge that would be assisted with a grant

(I) is, without that assistance

(aa) at risk of falling into or remaining in poor condition; or

(bb) in fair condition and at risk of falling into poor condition within the next 3 years;

(II) does not meet current geometric design standards based on

(aa) the current use of the bridge; or

(bb) load and traffic requirements typical of the regional corridor or local network in which the bridge is located; or

(III) does not meet current seismic design standards.

(B) Requirement .

The Secretary shall

(i) give priority to an application for an eligible project that is located within a State for which

(I) 2 or more applications for eligible projects within the State were submitted for the current fiscal year and an average of 2 or more applications for eligible projects within the State were submitted in prior fiscal years of the program; and

(II) fewer than 2 grants have been awarded for eligible projects within the State under the program;

(ii) during the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, for each State described in clause (i), select

(I) not fewer than 1 large project that the Secretary determines is justified under the evaluation under subsection (g)(4); or

(II) 2 eligible projects that are not large projects that the Secretary determines are justified under the evaluation under subsection (f)(3); and

(iii) not be required to award a grant for an eligible project that the Secretary does not determine is justified under an evaluation under subsection (f)(3) or (g)(4).

(6) Culvert limitation .

Not more than 5 percent of the amounts made available for each fiscal year for grants under the program may be used for eligible projects that consist solely of culvert replacement or rehabilitation.
