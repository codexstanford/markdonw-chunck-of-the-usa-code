###### (d) Participating Agencies.

(1) In general .

The lead agency shall be responsible for inviting and designating participating agencies in accordance with this subsection.

(2) Invitation .

Not later than 45 days after the date of publication of a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement or the initiation of an environmental assessment, the lead agency shall identify any other Federal and non-Federal agencies that may have an interest in the project, and shall invite such agencies to become participating agencies in the environmental review process for the project. The invitation shall set a deadline for responses to be submitted. The deadline may be extended by the lead agency for good cause.

(3) Federal participating agencies .

Any Federal agency that is invited by the lead agency to participate in the environmental review process for a project shall be designated as a participating agency by the lead agency unless the invited agency informs the lead agency, in writing, by the deadline specified in the invitation that the invited agency

(A) has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project;

(B) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and

(C) does not intend to submit comments on the project.

(4) Effect of designation.

(A) Requirement .

A participating agency shall comply with the requirements of this section.

(B) Implication .

Designation as a participating agency under this subsection shall not imply that the participating agency

(i) supports a proposed project; or

(ii) has any jurisdiction over, or special expertise with respect to evaluation of, the project.

(5) Cooperating agency .

A participating agency may also be designated by a lead agency as a “cooperating agency” under the regulations contained in part 1500 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations.

(6) Designations for categories of projects .

The Secretary may exercise the authorities granted under this subsection for a project, class of projects, or program of projects.

(7) Concurrent reviews .

Each participating agency and cooperating agency shall

(A) carry out the obligations of that agency under other applicable law concurrently, and in conjunction, with the review required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), unless doing so would impair the ability of the Federal agency to conduct needed analysis or otherwise carry out those obligations; and

(B) formulate and implement administrative, policy, and procedural mechanisms to enable the agency to ensure completion of the environmental review process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner.

(8) Single environmental document.

(A) In general .

Except as inconsistent with paragraph (7) and except as provided in subparagraph (D), to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law, all Federal authorizations and reviews for a project shall rely on a single environmental document for each kind of environmental document prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) under the leadership of the lead agency.

(B) Use of document .

(i) In general .

To the maximum extent practicable, the lead agency shall develop environmental documents sufficient to satisfy the requirements for any Federal approval or other Federal action required for the project, including authorizations by other Federal agencies.

(ii) Cooperation of participating agencies .

Other participating agencies shall cooperate with the lead agency and provide timely information to help the lead agency carry out this subparagraph.

(C) Treatment as participating and cooperating agencies .

A Federal agency required to make an approval or take an action for a project, as described in subparagraph (B), shall work with the lead agency for the project to ensure that the agency making the approval or taking the action is treated as being both a participating and cooperating agency for the project.

(D) Exceptions .

The lead agency may waive the application of subparagraph (A) with respect to a project if

(i) the project sponsor requests that agencies issue separate environmental documents;

(ii) the obligations of a cooperating agency or participating agency under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) have already been satisfied with respect to the project; or

(iii) the lead agency determines that reliance on a single environmental document (as described in subparagraph (A)) would not facilitate timely completion of the environmental review process for the project.

(9) Participating agency responsibilities .

An agency participating in the environmental review process under this section shall

(A) provide comments, responses, studies, or methodologies on those areas within the special expertise or jurisdiction of the agency; and

(B) use the process to address any environmental issues of concern to the agency.

(10) Timely authorizations for major projects.

(A) Deadline .

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), all authorization decisions necessary for the construction of a major project shall be completed by not later than 90 days after the date of the issuance of a record of decision for the major project.

(B) Detail .

The final environmental impact statement for a major project shall include an adequate level of detail to inform decisions necessary for the role of the participating agencies and cooperating agencies in the environmental review process.

(C) Extension of deadline .

The head of the lead agency may extend the deadline under subparagraph (A) if

(i) Federal law prohibits the lead agency or another agency from issuing an approval or permit within the period described in that subparagraph;

(ii) the project sponsor requests that the permit or approval follow a different timeline; or

(iii) an extension would facilitate completion of the environmental review and authorization process of the major project.
