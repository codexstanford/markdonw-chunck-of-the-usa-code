### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 176. Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-saving Transportation (PROTECT) program
###### (b) Establishment.

(1) In general .

The Secretary shall establish a program, to be known as the “Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-saving Transportation program” or the “PROTECT program”.

(2) Purpose .

The purpose of the program is to provide grants for resilience improvements through

(A) formula funding distributed to States to carry out subsection (c);

(B) competitive planning grants to enable communities to assess vulnerabilities to current and future weather events and natural disasters and changing conditions, including sea level rise, and plan transportation improvements and emergency response strategies to address those vulnerabilities; and

(C) competitive resilience improvement grants to protect

(i) surface transportation assets by making the assets more resilient to current and future weather events and natural disasters, such as severe storms, flooding, drought, levee and dam failures, wildfire, rockslides, mudslides, sea level rise, extreme weather, including extreme temperature, and earthquakes;

(ii) communities through resilience improvements and strategies that allow for the continued operation or rapid recovery of surface transportation systems that

(I) serve critical local, regional, and national needs, including evacuation routes; and

(II) provide access or service to hospitals and other medical or emergency service facilities, major employers, critical manufacturing centers, ports and intermodal facilities, utilities, and Federal facilities;

(iii) coastal infrastructure, such as a tide gate to protect highways, that is at long-term risk to sea level rise; and

(iv) natural infrastructure that protects and enhances surface transportation assets while improving ecosystem conditions, including culverts that ensure adequate flows in rivers and estuarine systems.
