### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 166. HOV facilities
###### (d) HOV Facility Management, Operation, Monitoring, and Enforcement.

(1) In general .

A public authority that allows vehicles to use a HOV facility under paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (b) shall submit to the Secretary a report demonstrating that the facility is not already degraded, and that the presence of the vehicles will not cause the facility to become degraded, and certify to the Secretary that the authority will carry out the following responsibilities with respect to the facility:

(A) Establishing, managing, and supporting a performance monitoring, evaluation, and reporting program for the facility that provides for continuous monitoring, assessment, and reporting on the impacts that the vehicles may have on the operation of the facility and adjacent highways and submitting to the Secretary annual reports of those impacts.

(B) Establishing, managing, and supporting an enforcement program that ensures that the facility is being operated in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(C) Limiting or discontinuing the use of the facility by the vehicles whenever the operation of the facility is degraded.

(D) Maintenance of operating performance.

(i) Submission of plan .

Not later than 180 days after the date on which a facility is degraded under paragraph (2), the public authority with jurisdiction over the facility shall submit to the Secretary for approval a plan that details the actions the public authority will take to make significant progress toward bringing the facility into compliance with the minimum average operating speed performance standard through changes to the operation of the facility, including

(I) increasing the occupancy requirement for HOV lanes;

(II) varying the toll charged to vehicles allowed under subsection (b) to reduce demand;

(III) discontinuing allowing non-HOV vehicles to use HOV lanes under subsection (b); or

(IV) increasing the available capacity of the HOV facility.

(ii) Notice of approval or disapproval .

Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a plan under clause (i), the Secretary shall provide to the public authority a written notice indicating whether the Secretary has approved or disapproved the plan based on a determination of whether the implementation of the plan will make significant progress toward bringing the HOV facility into compliance with the minimum average operating speed performance standard.

(iii) Annual progress updates .

Until the date on which the Secretary determines that the public authority has brought the HOV facility into compliance with this subsection, the public authority shall submit annual updates that describe

(I) the actions taken to bring the HOV facility into compliance; and

(II) the progress made by those actions.

(E) Compliance .

If the public authority fails to bring a facility into compliance under subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall subject the public authority to appropriate program sanctions under section 1.36 of title 23, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), until the performance is no longer degraded.

(F) Waiver.

(i) In general .

Upon the request of a public authority, the Secretary may waive the compliance requirements of subparagraph (E), if the Secretary determines that

(I) the waiver is in the best interest of the traveling public;

(II) the public authority is meeting the conditions under subparagraph (D); and

(III) the public authority has made a good faith effort to improve the performance of the facility.

(ii) Condition .

The Secretary may require, as a condition of providing a waiver under this subparagraph, that a public authority take additional actions, as determined by the Secretary, to maximize the operating speed performance of the facility, even if such performance is below the level set under paragraph (2).

(2) Degraded facility.

(A) Definition of minimum average operating speed .

In this paragraph, the term “minimum average operating speed” means

(i) 45 miles per hour, in the case of a HOV facility with a speed limit of 50 miles per hour or greater; and

(ii) not more than 10 miles per hour below the speed limit, in the case of a HOV facility with a speed limit of less than 50 miles per hour.

(B) Standard for determining degraded facility .

For purposes of paragraph (1), the operation of a HOV facility shall be considered to be degraded if vehicles operating on the facility are failing to maintain a minimum average operating speed 90 percent of the time over a consecutive 180-day period during morning or evening weekday peak hour periods (or both).

(C) Management of low emission and energy-efficient vehicles .

In managing the use of HOV lanes by low emission and energy-efficient vehicles that do not meet applicable occupancy requirements, a public authority may increase the percentages described in subsection (f)(3)(B)(i).
