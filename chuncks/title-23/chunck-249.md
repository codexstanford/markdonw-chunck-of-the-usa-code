### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 139. Efficient environmental reviews for project decisionmaking and One Federal Decision
###### (n) Accelerated Decisionmaking in Environmental Reviews.

(1) In general .

In preparing a final environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), if the lead agency modifies the statement in response to comments that are minor and are confined to factual corrections or explanations of why the comments do not warrant additional agency response, the lead agency may write on errata sheets attached to the statement instead of rewriting the draft statement, subject to the condition that the errata sheets

(A) cite the sources, authorities, and reasons that support the position of the agency; and

(B) if appropriate, indicate the circumstances that would trigger agency reappraisal or further response.

(2) Single document .

To the maximum extent practicable, the lead agency shall expeditiously develop a single document that consists of a final environmental impact statement and a record of decision, unless

(A) the final environmental impact statement makes substantial changes to the proposed action that are relevant to environmental or safety concerns; or

(B) there is a significant new circumstance or information relevant to environmental concerns that bears on the proposed action or the impacts of the proposed action.

(3) Length of environmental document.

(A) In general .

Notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in subparagraph (B), to the maximum extent practicable, the text of the items described in paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 1502.10(a) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), of an environmental impact statement for a project shall be 200 pages or fewer.

(B) Exemption .

An environmental impact statement for a project may exceed 200 pages, if the lead agency establishes a new page limit for the environmental impact statement for that project.
