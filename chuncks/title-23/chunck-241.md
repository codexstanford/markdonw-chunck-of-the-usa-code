###### (f) Purpose and Need; Alternatives Analysis.

(1) Participation .

As early as practicable during the environmental review process, the lead agency shall provide an opportunity for involvement by participating agencies and the public in defining the purpose and need for a project.

(2) Definition .

Following participation under paragraph (1), the lead agency shall define the project’s purpose and need for purposes of any document which the lead agency is responsible for preparing for the project.

(3) Objectives .

The statement of purpose and need shall include a clear statement of the objectives that the proposed action is intended to achieve, which may include

(A) achieving a transportation objective identified in an applicable statewide or metropolitan transportation plan;

(B) supporting land use, economic development, or growth objectives established in applicable Federal, State, local, or tribal plans; and

(C) serving national defense, national security, or other national objectives, as established in Federal laws, plans, or policies.

(4) Alternatives analysis.

(A) Participation.

(i) In general.

As early as practicable during the environmental review process, the lead agency shall provide an opportunity for involvement by participating agencies and the public in determining the range of alternatives to be considered for a project.

(ii) Comments of participating agencies .

To the maximum extent practicable and consistent with applicable law, each participating agency receiving an opportunity for involvement under clause (i) shall limit the comments of the agency to subject matter areas within the special expertise or jurisdiction of the agency.

(iii) Effect of nonparticipation .

A participating agency that declines to participate in the development of the purpose and need and range of alternatives for a project shall be required to comply with the schedule developed under subsection (g)(1)(B).

(B) Range of alternatives .

(i) Determination .

Following participation under subparagraph (A), the lead agency shall determine the range of alternatives for consideration in any document which the lead agency is responsible for preparing for the project.

(ii) Use .

To the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law, the range of alternatives determined for a project under clause (i) shall be used for all Federal environmental reviews and permit processes required for the project unless the alternatives must be modified

(I) to address significant new information or circumstances, and the lead agency and participating agencies agree that the alternatives must be modified to address the new information or circumstances; or

(II) for the lead agency or a participating agency to fulfill the responsibilities of the agency under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) in a timely manner.

(C) Methodologies .

The lead agency also shall determine, in collaboration with participating agencies at appropriate times during the study process, the methodologies to be used and the level of detail required in the analysis of each alternative for a project.

(D) Preferred alternative .

At the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives in order to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that the development of such higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative which is being considered in the environmental review process.

(E) Reduction of duplication.

(i) In general .

In carrying out this paragraph, the lead agency shall reduce duplication, to the maximum extent practicable, between

(I) the evaluation of alternatives under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and

(II) the evaluation of alternatives in the metropolitan transportation planning process under section 134 or an environmental review process carried out under State law (referred to in this subparagraph as a “State environmental review process”).

(ii) Consideration of alternatives .

The lead agency may eliminate from detailed consideration an alternative proposed in an environmental impact statement regarding a project if, as determined by the lead agency

(I) the alternative was considered in a metropolitan planning process or a State environmental review process by a metropolitan planning organization or a State or local transportation agency, as applicable;

(II) the lead agency provided guidance to the metropolitan planning organization or State or local transportation agency, as applicable, regarding analysis of alternatives in the metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process, including guidance on the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and any other Federal law necessary for approval of the project;

(III) the applicable metropolitan planning process or State environmental review process included an opportunity for public review and comment;

(IV) the applicable metropolitan planning organization or State or local transportation agency rejected the alternative after considering public comments;

(V) the Federal lead agency independently reviewed the alternative evaluation approved by the applicable metropolitan planning organization or State or local transportation agency; and

(VI) the Federal lead agency determined

(aa) in consultation with Federal participating or cooperating agencies, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); or

(bb) with the concurrence of Federal agencies with jurisdiction over a permit or approval required for a project, that the alternative to be eliminated from consideration is not necessary for any permit or approval under any other Federal law.
