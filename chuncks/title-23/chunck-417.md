### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 172. Wildlife-vehicle collision reduction and habitat connectivity improvement
###### (d) National Threshold Guidance .

The Secretary shall

(1) establish guidance, to be carried out by States on a voluntary basis, that contains a threshold for determining whether a highway shall be evaluated for potential mitigation measures to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and increase habitat connectivity for terrestrial and aquatic species, taking into consideration

(A) the number of wildlife-vehicle collisions on the highway that pose a human safety risk;

(B) highway-related mortality and the effects of traffic on the highway on

(i) species listed as endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);

(ii) species identified by a State as species of greatest conservation need;

(iii) species identified in State wildlife plans; and

(iv) medium and small terrestrial and aquatic species; and

(C) habitat connectivity values for terrestrial and aquatic species and the barrier effect of the highway on the movements and migrations of those species.
