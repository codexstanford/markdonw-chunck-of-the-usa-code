#### § 149. Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program
###### (b) Eligible Projects .

Except as provided in subsections (d) and (m)(1)(B)(ii), a State may obligate funds apportioned to it under section 104(b)(4) for the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program only for a transportation project or program if the project or program is for an area in the State that is or was designated as a nonattainment area for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particulate matter under section 107(d) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7407(d) ) and classified pursuant to section 181(a), 186(a), 188(a), or 188(b) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7511(a) , 7512(a), 7513(a), or 7513(b)) or is or was designated as a nonattainment area under such section 107(d) after December 31, 1997 , or is required to prepare, and file with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, maintenance plans under the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and

(1)

(A)

(i) if the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator determines, on the basis of information published by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act (other than clause (xvi)) that the project or program is likely to contribute to

(I) the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard in the designated nonattainment area; or

(II) the maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard in a maintenance area; and

(ii) a high level of effectiveness in reducing air pollution, in cases of projects or programs where sufficient information is available in the database established pursuant to subsection (h) to determine the relative effectiveness of such projects or programs; or,

(B) in any case in which such information is not available, if the Secretary, after such consultation, determines that the project or program is part of a program, method, or strategy described in such section 108(f)(1)(A);

(2) if the project or program is included in a State implementation plan that has been approved pursuant to the Clean Air Act and the project will have air quality benefits;

(3) the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines that the project or program is likely to contribute to the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard, whether through reductions in vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, or through other factors;

(4) to establish or operate a traffic monitoring, management, and control facility or program, including advanced truck stop electrification systems, if the Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines that the facility or program is likely to contribute to the attainment or maintenance in the area of a national ambient air quality standard;

(5) if the program or project improves traffic flow, including projects to improve signalization, construct high occupancy vehicle lanes, improve intersections, add turning lanes, improve transportation systems management and operations that mitigate congestion and improve air quality, and implement intelligent transportation system strategies and such other projects that are eligible for assistance under this section on the day before the date of enactment of this paragraph, including programs or projects to improve incident and emergency response or improve mobility, such as through real-time traffic, transit, and multimodal traveler information;

(6) if the project or program involves the purchase of integrated, interoperable emergency communications equipment;

(7) if the project or program shifts traffic demand to nonpeak hours or other transportation modes, increases vehicle occupancy rates, or otherwise reduces demand for roads through such means as telecommuting, ridesharing, carsharing, shared micromobility (including bikesharing and shared scooter systems), alternative work hours, and pricing;

(8) if the project or program is for

(A) the purchase of diesel replacements or retrofits that are

(i) verified technologies (as defined in section 791 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( 42 U.S.C. 16131 )) for motor vehicles (as defined in section 216 of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7550 )); or

(ii) verified technologies (as defined in section 791 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( 42 U.S.C. 16131 )) for non-road vehicles and non-road engines (as defined in section 216 of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7550 )) that are used in construction projects or port-related freight operations that are

(I) located in nonattainment or maintenance areas for ozone, PM 10 , or PM 2.5 (as defined under the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)); and

(II) funded, in whole or in part, under this title or chapter 53 of title 49;

(B) the conduct of outreach activities that are designed to provide information and technical assistance to the owners and operators of diesel equipment and vehicles regarding the purchase and installation of diesel replacements or retrofits; or

(C) the purchase of medium- or heavy-duty zero emission vehicles and related charging equipment;

(9) if the project or program is for the installation of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication equipment;

(10) if the project is for the modernization or rehabilitation of a lock and dam that

(A) is functionally connected to the Federal-aid highway system; and

(B) the Secretary determines is likely to contribute to the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard; or

(11) if the project is on a marine highway corridor, connector, or crossing designated by the Secretary under section 55601(c) of title 46 (including an inland waterway corridor, connector, or crossing) that

(A) is functionally connected to the Federal-aid highway system; and

(B) the Secretary determines is likely to contribute to the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard.
