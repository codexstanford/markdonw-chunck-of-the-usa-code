Congress finds that

(A) the condition of the bridges of the United States has improved since the date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( Public Law 105–178 ; 112 Stat. 107 ), yet continued improvement to bridge conditions is essential to protect the safety of the traveling public and allow for the efficient movement of people and goods on which the economy of the United States relies; and

(B) the systematic preventative maintenance of bridges, and replacement and rehabilitation of deficient bridges, should be undertaken through an overall asset management approach to transportation investment.
