### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 139. Efficient environmental reviews for project decisionmaking and One Federal Decision
###### (g) Coordination and Scheduling.

(1) Coordination plan.

(A) In general .

Not later than 90 days after the date of publication of a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement or the initiation of an environmental assessment, the lead agency shall establish a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review process for a project or category of projects. The coordination plan may be incorporated into a memorandum of understanding.

(B) Schedule.

(i) In general .

The lead agency shall establish as part of such coordination plan, after consultation with and the concurrence of each participating agency for the project and with the State in which the project is located (and, if the State is not the project sponsor, with the project sponsor), a schedule for completion of the environmental review process for the project.

(ii) Factors for consideration .

In establishing the schedule, the lead agency shall consider factors such as

(I) the responsibilities of participating agencies under applicable laws;

(II) resources available to the cooperating agencies;

(III) overall size and complexity of the project;

(IV) the overall time required by an agency to conduct an environmental review and make decisions under applicable Federal law relating to a project (including the issuance or denial of a permit or license) and the cost of the project; and

(V) the sensitivity of the natural and historic resources that could be affected by the project.

(iii) Major project schedule .

To the maximum extent practicable and consistent with applicable Federal law, in the case of a major project, the lead agency shall develop, in concurrence with the project sponsor, a schedule for the major project that is consistent with an agency average of not more than 2 years for the completion of the environmental review process for major projects, as measured from, as applicable

(I) the date of publication of a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement to the record of decision; or

(II) the date on which the head of the lead agency determines that an environmental assessment is required to a finding of no significant impact.

(C) Consistency with other time periods .

A schedule under subparagraph (B) shall be consistent with any other relevant time periods established under Federal law.

(D) Modification.

(i) In general .

Except as provided in clause (ii), the lead agency may lengthen or shorten a schedule established under subparagraph (B) for good cause.

(ii) Exceptions.

(I) Major projects .

In the case of a major project, the lead agency may lengthen a schedule under clause (i) for a cooperating Federal agency by not more than 1 year after the latest deadline established for the major project by the lead agency.

(II) Shortened schedules .

The lead agency may not shorten a schedule under clause (i) if doing so would impair the ability of a cooperating Federal agency to conduct necessary analyses or otherwise carry out relevant obligations of the Federal agency for the project.

(E) Failure to meet deadline .

If a cooperating Federal agency fails to meet a deadline established under subparagraph (D)(ii)(I)

(i) the cooperating Federal agency shall submit to the Secretary a report that describes the reasons why the deadline was not met; and

(ii) the Secretary shall

(I) transmit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a copy of the report under clause (i); and

(II) make the report under clause (i) publicly available on the internet.

(F) Dissemination .

A copy of a schedule under subparagraph (B), and of any modifications to the schedule, shall be

(i) provided to all participating agencies and to the State transportation department of the State in which the project is located (and, if the State is not the project sponsor, to the project sponsor); and

(ii) made available to the public.

(2) Comment deadlines .

The lead agency shall establish the following deadlines for comment during the environmental review process for a project:

(A) For comments by agencies and the public on a draft environmental impact statement, a period of not more than 60 days after publication in the Federal Register of notice of the date of public availability of such document, unless

(i) a different deadline is established by agreement of the lead agency, the project sponsor, and all participating agencies; or

(ii) the deadline is extended by the lead agency for good cause.

(B) For all other comment periods established by the lead agency for agency or public comments in the environmental review process, a period of no more than 30 days from availability of the materials on which comment is requested, unless

(i) a different deadline is established by agreement of the lead agency, the project sponsor, and all participating agencies; or

(ii) the deadline is extended by the lead agency for good cause.

(3) Deadlines for decisions under other laws .

In any case in which a decision under any Federal law relating to a project (including the issuance or denial of a permit or license) is required to be made by the later of the date that is 180 days after the date on which the Secretary made all final decisions of the lead agency with respect to the project, or 180 days after the date on which an application was submitted for the permit or license, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and publish on the Internet

(A) as soon as practicable after the 180-day period, an initial notice of the failure of the Federal agency to make the decision; and

(B) every 60 days thereafter until such date as all decisions of the Federal agency relating to the project have been made by the Federal agency, an additional notice that describes the number of decisions of the Federal agency that remain outstanding as of the date of the additional notice.

(4) Involvement of the public .

Nothing in this subsection shall reduce any time period provided for public comment in the environmental review process under existing Federal law, including a regulation.
