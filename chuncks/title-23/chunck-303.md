###### (d) States Flexibility.

(1) States without a nonattainment area .

If a State does not have, and never has had, a nonattainment area designated under the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the State may use funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(4) for any project in the State that

(A) would otherwise be eligible under subsection (b) as if the project were carried out in a nonattainment or maintenance area; or

(B) is eligible under the surface transportation block grant program under section 133.

(2) States with a nonattainment area.

(A) In general .

If a State has a nonattainment area or maintenance area and received funds in fiscal year 2009 under section 104(b)(2)(D), as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the MAP–21, above the amount of funds that the State would have received based on the nonattainment and maintenance area population of the State under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 104(b)(2), as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the MAP–21, the State may use for any project that would otherwise be eligible under subsection (b) if the project were carried out in a nonattainment or maintenance area or is eligible under the surface transportation block grant program under section 133 an amount of funds apportioned to such State under section 104(b)(4) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying

(i) the amount apportioned to such State under section 104(b)(4) (excluding the amount of funds reserved under subsection (k)(1)); by

(ii) the ratio calculated under subparagraph (B).

(B) Ratio .

For purposes of this paragraph, the ratio shall be calculated as the proportion that

(i) the amount for fiscal year 2009 such State was permitted by section 149(c)(2), as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the MAP–21, to obligate in any area of the State for projects eligible under section 133, as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the MAP–21; bears to

(ii) the total apportionment to such State for fiscal year 2009 under section 104(b)(2), as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the MAP–21.

(3) Changes in designation .

If a new nonattainment area is designated or a previously designated nonattainment area is redesignated as an attainment area in a State under the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Secretary shall modify, in a manner consistent with the approach that was in effect on the day before the date of enactment of MAP–21, the amount such State is permitted to obligate in any area of the State for projects eligible under section 133.
