(3) Draws .

Any draw on a line of credit under this section shall

(4) Interest rate .

Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 603(b)(4), the interest rate on a direct loan resulting from a draw on the line of credit shall be not less than the yield on 30-year United States Treasury securities, as of the date of execution of the line of credit agreement.

A line of credit issued under this section

(A) shall

(II) user fees;

(III) payments owing to the obligor under a public-private partnership; or

(IV) other dedicated revenue sources that also secure the senior project obligations; and

(ii) include a rate covenant, coverage requirement, or similar security feature supporting the project obligations; and

(B) may have a lien on revenues described in subparagraph (A), subject to any lien securing project obligations.

(6) Period of availability .

The full amount of a line of credit under this section, to the extent not drawn upon, shall be available during the 10-year period beginning on the date of substantial completion of the project.

An obligor may assign a line of credit under this section to

(i) 1 or more lenders; or

(ii) a trustee on the behalf of such a lender.

(8) Nonsubordination .

(A) In general .

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a direct loan under this section shall not be subordinated to the claims of any holder of project obligations in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation of the obligor.

(B) Pre-existing indenture .

(i) In general .

The Secretary shall waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) for a public agency borrower that is financing ongoing capital programs and has outstanding senior bonds under a preexisting indenture, if

(I) the line of credit is rated in the A category or higher;

(II) the TIFIA program loan resulting from a draw on the line of credit is payable from pledged revenues not affected by project performance, such as a tax-backed revenue pledge or a system-backed pledge of project revenues; and

(III) the TIFIA program share of eligible project costs is 33 percent or less.

(ii) Limitation .

If the Secretary waives the nonsubordination requirement under this subparagraph

(I) the maximum credit subsidy to be paid by the Federal Government shall be not more than 10 percent of the principal amount of the secured loan; and

(II) the obligor shall be responsible for paying the remainder of the subsidy cost.

(9) Fees .

The Secretary may establish fees at a level sufficient to cover all or a portion of the costs to the Federal Government of providing a line of credit under this section.

(10) Relationship to other credit instruments .

A project that receives a line of credit under this section also shall not receive a secured loan or loan guarantee under section 603 in an amount that, combined with the amount of the line of credit, exceeds 49 percent of eligible project costs.
