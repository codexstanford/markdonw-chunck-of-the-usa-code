### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 106. Project approval and oversight
###### (e) Value Engineering Analysis.

(1) Definition of value engineering analysis.

(A) In general .

In this subsection, the term “value engineering analysis” means a systematic process of review and analysis of a project, during the planning and design phases, by a multidisciplinary team of persons not involved in the project, that is conducted to provide recommendations such as those described in subparagraph (B) for

(i) providing the needed functions safely, reliably, and at the lowest overall lifecycle cost;

(ii) improving the value and quality of the project; and

(iii) reducing the time to complete the project.

(B) Inclusions .

The recommendations referred to in subparagraph (A) include, with respect to a project

(i) combining or eliminating otherwise inefficient use of costly parts of the original proposed design for the project; and

(ii) completely redesigning the project using different technologies, materials, or methods so as to accomplish the original purpose of the project.

(2) Analysis .

The State shall provide a value engineering analysis for

(A) each project on the National Highway System receiving Federal assistance with an estimated total cost of $50,000,000 or more;

(B) a bridge project on the National Highway System receiving Federal assistance with an estimated total cost of $40,000,000 or more; and

(C) any other project the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(3) Major projects .

The Secretary may require more than 1 analysis described in paragraph (2) for a major project described in subsection (h).

(4) Requirements .

(A) Value engineering program .

The State shall develop and carry out a value engineering program that

(i) establishes and documents value engineering program policies and procedures;

(ii) ensures that the required value engineering analysis is conducted before completing the final design of a project;

(iii) ensures that the value engineering analysis that is conducted, and the recommendations developed and implemented for each project, are documented in a final value engineering report; and

(iv) monitors, evaluates, and annually submits to the Secretary a report that describes the results of the value analyses that are conducted and the recommendations implemented for each of the projects described in paragraph (2) that are completed in the State.

(B) Bridge projects .

The value engineering analysis for a bridge project under paragraph (2) shall

(i) include bridge superstructure and substructure requirements based on construction material; and

(ii) be evaluated by the State

(I) on engineering and economic bases, taking into consideration acceptable designs for bridges; and

(II) using an analysis of lifecycle costs and duration of project construction.

(5) Design-build projects .

A requirement to provide a value engineering analysis under this subsection shall not apply to a project delivered using the design-build method of construction.
