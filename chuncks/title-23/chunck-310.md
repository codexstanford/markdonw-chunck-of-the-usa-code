### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 149. Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program
###### (k) Priority for Use of Funds in PM 2.5 Areas.

(1) In general .

For any State that has a nonattainment or maintenance area for fine particulate matter, an amount equal to 25 percent of the funds apportioned to each State under section 104(b)(4) for a nonattainment or maintenance area that are based all or in part on the weighted population of such area in fine particulate matter nonattainment shall be obligated to projects that

(A) reduce such fine particulate matter emissions in such area, including diesel replacements or retrofits; and

(B) to the extent practicable, prioritize benefits to disadvantaged communities or low-income populations living in, or immediately adjacent to, such area.

(2) Construction equipment and vehicles .

In order to meet the requirements of paragraph (1), a State or metropolitan planning organization may elect to obligate funds to install diesel emission control technology on nonroad diesel equipment or on-road diesel equipment that is operated on a highway construction project within a PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance area.

(3) PM 2.5 nonattainment and maintenance in low population density states.

(A) Exception .

In any State with a population density of 80 or fewer persons per square mile of land area, based on the most recent decennial census, the requirements under subsection (g)(3) and paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply to a nonattainment or maintenance area in the State if

(i) the nonattainment or maintenance area does not have projects that are part of the emissions analysis of a metropolitan transportation plan or transportation improvement program; and

(ii) regional motor vehicle emissions are an insignificant contributor to the air quality problem for PM2.5 in the nonattainment or maintenance area.

(B) Calculation .

If subparagraph (A) applies to a nonattainment or maintenance area in a State, the percentage of the PM2.5 set-aside under paragraph (1) shall be reduced for that State proportionately based on the weighted population of the area in fine particulate matter nonattainment.

(4) Port-related equipment and vehicles .

To meet the requirements under paragraph (1), a State or metropolitan planning organization may elect to obligate funds to the most cost-effective projects to reduce emissions from port-related landside nonroad or on-road equipment that is operated within the boundaries of a PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance area.
