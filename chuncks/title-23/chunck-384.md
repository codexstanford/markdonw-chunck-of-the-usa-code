### CHAPTER 1— FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS
#### § 167. National highway freight program
###### (h) Use of Apportioned Funds.

(1) In general .

A State shall obligate funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5) to improve the movement of freight on the National Highway Freight Network.

(2) Formula .

The Administrator shall calculate for each State the proportion that

(A) the total mileage in the State designated as part of the primary highway freight system; bears to

(B) the total mileage of the primary highway freight system in all States.

(3) Use of funds.

(A) States with high primary highway freight system mileage .

If the proportion of a State under paragraph (2) is greater than or equal to 2 percent, the State may obligate funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5) for projects on

(i) the primary highway freight system;

(ii) critical rural freight corridors; and

(iii) critical urban freight corridors.

(B) States with low primary highway freight system mileage .

If the proportion of a State under paragraph (2) is less than 2 percent, the State may obligate funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5) for projects on any component of the National Highway Freight Network.

(4) Freight planning .

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective beginning 2 years after the date of enactment of the FAST Act, a State may not obligate funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5) unless the State has developed a freight plan in accordance with section 70202 of title 49 , except that the multimodal component of the plan may be incomplete before an obligation may be made under this section.

(5) Eligibility.

(A) In general .

Except as provided in this subsection, for a project to be eligible for funding under this section the project shall

(i) contribute to the efficient movement of freight on the National Highway Freight Network; and

(ii) be identified in a freight investment plan included in a freight plan of the State that is in effect.

(B) Other projects .

For each fiscal year, a State may obligate not more than 30 percent of the total apportionment of the State under section 104(b)(5) for freight intermodal or freight rail projects, including projects

(i) within the boundaries of public or private freight rail or water facilities (including ports);

(ii) that provide surface transportation infrastructure necessary to facilitate direct intermodal interchange, transfer, and access into or out of the facility;

(iii) for the modernization or rehabilitation of a lock and dam, if the Secretary determines that the project

(I) is functionally connected to the National Highway Freight Network; and

(II) is likely to reduce on-road mobile source emissions; and

(iv) on a marine highway corridor, connector, or crossing designated by the Secretary under section 55601(c) of title 46 (including an inland waterway corridor, connector, or crossing), if the Secretary determines that the project

(I) is functionally connected to the National Highway Freight Network; and

(II) is likely to reduce on-road mobile source emissions.

(C) Eligible projects .

Funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5) for the national highway freight program may be obligated to carry out 1 or more of the following:

(i) Development phase activities, including planning, feasibility analysis, revenue forecasting, environmental review, preliminary engineering and design work, and other preconstruction activities.

(ii) Construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, acquisition of real property (including land relating to the project and improvements to land), construction contingencies, acquisition of equipment, and operational improvements directly relating to improving system performance.

(iii) Intelligent transportation systems and other technology to improve the flow of freight, including intelligent freight transportation systems.

(iv) Efforts to reduce the environmental impacts of freight movement.

(v) Environmental and community mitigation for freight movement.

(vi) Railway-highway grade separation.

(vii) Geometric improvements to interchanges and ramps.

(viii) Truck-only lanes.

(ix) Climbing and runaway truck lanes.

(x) Adding or widening of shoulders.

(xi) Truck parking facilities eligible for funding under section 1401 of MAP–21 ( 23 U.S.C. 137 note).

(xii) Real-time traffic, truck parking, roadway condition, and multimodal transportation information systems.

(xiii) Electronic screening and credentialing systems for vehicles, including weigh-in-motion truck inspection technologies.

(xiv) Traffic signal optimization, including synchronized and adaptive signals.

(xv) Work zone management and information systems.

(xvi) Highway ramp metering.

(xvii) Electronic cargo and border security technologies that improve truck freight movement.

(xviii) Intelligent transportation systems that would increase truck freight efficiencies inside the boundaries of intermodal facilities.

(xix) Additional road capacity to address highway freight bottlenecks.

(xx) Physical separation of passenger vehicles from commercial motor freight.

(xxi) Enhancement of the resiliency of critical highway infrastructure, including highway infrastructure that supports national energy security, to improve the flow of freight.

(xxii) A highway or bridge project, other than a project described in clauses (i) through (xxi), to improve the flow of freight on the National Highway Freight Network.

(xxiii) Any other surface transportation project to improve the flow of freight into and out of a facility described in subparagraph (B).

(6) Other eligible costs .

In addition to the eligible projects identified in paragraph (5), a State may use funds apportioned under section 104(b)(5) for

(A) carrying out diesel retrofit or alternative fuel projects under section 149 for class 8 vehicles; and

(B) the necessary costs of

(i) conducting analyses and data collection related to the national highway freight program;

(ii) developing and updating performance targets to carry out this section; and

(iii) reporting to the Administrator to comply with the freight performance target under section 150.

(7) Applicability of planning requirements .

Programming and expenditure of funds for projects under this section shall be consistent with the requirements of sections 134 and 135.
