##### (j) Analysis and forecasting

(1) Capabilities

In order to evaluate existing critical mineral policies and inform future actions that may be taken to avoid supply shortages, mitigate price volatility, and prepare for demand growth and other market shifts, the Secretary (acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey) or a designee of the Secretary, in consultation with the Energy Information Administration, academic institutions, and others in order to maximize the application of existing competencies related to developing and maintaining computer-models and similar analytical tools, shall conduct and publish the results of an annual report that includes

(A) as part of the annually published Mineral Commodity Summaries from the United States Geological Survey, a comprehensive review of critical mineral production, consumption, and recycling patterns, including

(i) the quantity of each critical mineral domestically produced during the preceding year;

(ii) the quantity of each critical mineral domestically consumed during the preceding year;

(iii) market price data or other price data for each critical mineral;

(iv) an assessment of

(I) critical mineral requirements to meet the national security, energy, economic, industrial, technological, and other needs of the United States during the preceding year;

(II) the reliance of the United States on foreign sources to meet those needs during the preceding year; and

(III) the implications of any supply shortages, restrictions, or disruptions during the preceding year;

(v) the quantity of each critical mineral domestically recycled during the preceding year;

(vi) the market penetration during the preceding year of alternatives to each critical mineral;

(vii) a discussion of international trends associated with the discovery, production, consumption, use, costs of production, prices, and recycling of each critical mineral as well as the development of alternatives to critical minerals; and

(viii) such other data, analyses, and evaluations as the Secretary finds are necessary to achieve the purposes of this subsection; and

(B) a comprehensive forecast, entitled the “Annual Critical Minerals Outlook”, of projected critical mineral production, consumption, and recycling patterns, including

(i) the quantity of each critical mineral projected to be domestically produced over the subsequent 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods;

(ii) the quantity of each critical mineral projected to be domestically consumed over the subsequent 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods;

(iii) an assessment of

(I) critical mineral requirements to meet projected national security, energy, economic, industrial, technological, and other needs of the United States;

(II) the projected reliance of the United States on foreign sources to meet those needs; and

(III) the projected implications of potential supply shortages, restrictions, or disruptions;

(iv) the quantity of each critical mineral projected to be domestically recycled over the subsequent 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods;

(v) the market penetration of alternatives to each critical mineral projected to take place over the subsequent 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods;

(vi) a discussion of reasonably foreseeable international trends associated with the discovery, production, consumption, use, costs of production, and recycling of each critical mineral as well as the development of alternatives to critical minerals; and

(vii) such other projections relating to each critical mineral as the Secretary determines to be necessary to achieve the purposes of this subsection.

(2) Proprietary information

In preparing a report described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure, consistent with section 1604(f) of this title , that

(A) no person uses the information and data collected for the report for a purpose other than the development of or reporting of aggregate data in a manner such that the identity of the person or firm who supplied the information is not discernible and is not material to the intended uses of the information;

(B) no person discloses any information or data collected for the report unless the information or data has been transformed into a statistical or aggregate form that does not allow the identification of the person or firm who supplied particular information; and

(C) procedures are established to require the withholding of any information or data collected for the report if the Secretary determines that withholding is necessary to protect proprietary information, including any trade secrets or other confidential information.
