### CHAPTER 28— MATERIALS AND MINERALS POLICY, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT
#### § 1606. Mineral security
##### (g) Recycling, innovation, efficiency, and alternatives

(1) Establishment

The Secretary of Energy (referred to in this subsection as the “Secretary”) shall conduct a program (referred to in this subsection as the “program”) of research, development, demonstration, and commercialization

(A) to develop alternatives to critical materials that do not occur in significant abundance in the United States;

(B) to promote the efficient production, use, and recycling of critical materials, with special consideration for domestic critical materials, throughout the supply chain;

(C) to ensure the long-term, secure, and sustainable supply of critical materials; and

(D) to prioritize work in areas that the private sector by itself is not likely to undertake due to financial or technical limitations.

(2) Cooperation

In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall cooperate with appropriate

(A) Federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior;

(B) the National Laboratories;

(C) critical material producers, processors, and manufacturers;

(D) trade associations;

(E) academic institutions (including students and postdoctoral staff at institutions of higher education);

(F) small businesses;

(G) nongovernmental organizations; and

(H) other relevant entities or individuals.

(3) Energy Innovation Hub

In carrying out the program, the Secretary may use an Energy Innovation Hub authorized under section 18632 of title 42 .

(4) Activities

Under the program, the Secretary shall carry out activities that include the identification and development of

(A) alternative materials, particularly materials available in abundance within the United States and not subject to potential supply restrictions, that lessen the need for critical materials;

(B) alternative energy technologies or alternative designs of existing energy technologies, particularly technologies or designs that use materials that

(i) occur in abundance in the United States; and

(ii) are not subject to potential supply restrictions;

(C) technologies or process improvements that minimize the use and content, or lead to more efficient use, of critical materials across the full supply chain;

(D) innovative technologies and practices to diversify commercially viable and sustainable domestic sources of critical materials, including technologies for recovery from waste streams;

(E) technologies, process improvements, or design optimizations that facilitate the recycling of critical materials, and options for improving the rates of collection of products and scrap containing critical materials from post-consumer, industrial, or other waste streams;

(F) advanced critical material extraction, production, separation, alloying, or processing technologies that decrease the energy consumption, environmental impact, and costs of those activities, including

(i) efficient water and wastewater management strategies;

(ii) technologies and management strategies to control the environmental impacts of radionuclides in ore tailings;

(iii) technologies for separation and processing; and

(iv) technologies for increasing the recovery rates of coproducts and byproducts from host metal ores;

(G) commercial markets, advanced storage methods, energy applications, and other beneficial uses of critical materials; and

(H) advanced theoretical, computational, and experimental tools necessary to support the crosscutting research and development needs of diverse critical minerals stakeholders.

(5) Plan

(A) In general

Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall submit to Congress a plan to carry out the program.

(B) Inclusions

The plan under subparagraph (A) shall include a description of

(i) the research and development activities to be carried out under the program during the subsequent 2 years;

(ii) the expected contributions under the program to the creation of innovative methods and technologies for the efficient and sustainable provision of critical materials to the domestic economy;

(iii) the expected activities under the program to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of the extraction, processing, manufacturing, use, recovery, and recycling of critical materials; and

(iv) how the program will promote the broadest possible participation by academic, industrial, and other contributors and the public.

(6) Coordination and nonduplication

To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall ensure that the activities carried out under this subsection are coordinated with, and do not duplicate the efforts of, other programs within the Federal Government, including the work underway by the Critical Materials Institute and the National Minerals Information Center.

(7) Standard of review

Not later than 2 years after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall conduct a review of activities carried out under the program to determine the achievement of the technical milestones identified under paragraph (8)(D)(i)(I).

(8) Critical materials consortium

(A) In general

Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall establish and operate a Critical Materials Consortium (referred to in this paragraph as the “Consortium”) for the purpose of supporting the program by providing, to the maximum extent practicable, a centralized entity for multidisciplinary, collaborative, critical materials research and development.

(B) Leadership

If an Energy Innovation Hub authorized under section 18632 of title 42 that is focused on critical materials exists on December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall leverage the personnel and expertise of the Energy Innovation Hub to manage the Consortium for not less than 3 years following the date on which the Consortium is established.

(C) Membership

The members of the Consortium shall be representatives from relevant Federal agencies, the National Laboratories, the National Minerals Information Center, institutions of higher education, private sector entities, multiinstitutional collaborations, and other appropriate entities.

(D) Responsibilities

The Consortium shall

(i) develop and implement a multiyear plan that

(I) identifies technical goals and milestones for the program;

(II) utilizes the high performance computing capabilities of the Department; and

(III) leverages the expertise of the National Laboratories and the United States Geological Survey; and

(ii) submit an annual report to the Secretary summarizing the activities of the Consortium, including an evaluation of the role of the Consortium in the achievement of the technical milestones identified under clause (i)(I).

(E) Sunset; termination

(i) In general

The Secretary may provide support to the Consortium for a period of not more than 10 years, subject to the availability of appropriations.

(ii) Merit review

Not later than 5 years after the date on which the Consortium is established, the Secretary shall conduct a rigorous merit review to determine whether the Consortium helped the program achieve the technical milestones identified under subparagraph (D)(i)(I).

(iii) Termination

If the Secretary determines that the Consortium has not helped the program achieve the technical milestones identified under subparagraph (D)(i)(I), the Secretary may terminate any financial or technical support that the Department provides to the Consortium.

(9) Reports

Not later than 2 years after December 27, 2020 , and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report summarizing the activities, findings, and progress of the program.

(10) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this subsection

(A) $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2021;

(B) $105,000,000 for fiscal year 2022;
