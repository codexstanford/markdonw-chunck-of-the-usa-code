#### § 868. Underground high-voltage distribution
##### (e) Underground cables used in resistance grounded systems; metallic shields for power conductors; standards; splices

(1) Underground high-voltage cables used in resistance grounded systems shall be equipped with metallic shields around each power conductor, with one or more ground conductors having a total cross-sectional area of not less than one-half the power conductor, and with an insulated internal or external conductor not smaller than No. 8 (AWG) for the ground continuity check circuit.

(2) All such cables shall be adequate for the intended current and voltage. Splices made in such cables shall provide continuity of all components.
