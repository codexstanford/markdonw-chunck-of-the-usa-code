#### § 1419. Protection of the environment
##### (a) Environmental assessment

(1) Deep ocean mining environmental study (DOMES)

The Administrator shall expand and accelerate the program assessing the effects on the environment from exploration and commercial recovery activities, including seabased processing and the disposal at sea of processing wastes, so as to provide an assessment, as accurate as practicable, of environmental impacts of such activities for the implementation of subsections (b), (c), and (d).

(2) Supporting ocean research

The Administrator also shall conduct a continuing program of ocean research to support environmental assessment activity through the period of exploration and commercial recovery authorized by this chapter. The program shall include the development, acceleration, and expansion, as appropriate, of studies of the ecological, geological, and physical aspects of the deep seabed in general areas of the ocean where exploration and commercial development under the authority of this chapter are likely to occur, including, but not limited to

(A) natural diversity of the deep seabed biota;

(B) life histories of major benthic, midwater, and surface organisms most likely to be affected by commercial recovery activities;

(C) long- and short-term effects of commercial recovery on the deep seabed biota; and

(D) assessment of the effects of seabased processing activities. Within 160 days after June 28, 1980 , the Administrator shall prepare a plan to carry out the program described in this subsection, including necessary funding levels for the next five fiscal years, and shall submit the plan to the Congress.
