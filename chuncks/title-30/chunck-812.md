#### § 1007. Readjustment of lease terms and conditions
##### (a) Initial readjustment; periodic intervals; notice; objections, relinquishment, and termination

The Secretary may readjust the terms and conditions, except as otherwise provided herein, of any geothermal lease issued under this chapter at not less than ten-year intervals beginning ten years after the date the geothermal steam is produced, as determined by the Secretary. Each geothermal lease issued under this chapter shall provide for such readjustment. The Secretary shall give notice of any proposed readjustment of terms and conditions, and, unless the lessee files with the Secretary objection to the proposed terms or relinquishes the lease within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the lessee shall conclusively be deemed to have agreed with such terms and conditions. If the lessee files objections, and no agreement can be reached between the Secretary and the lessee within a period of not less than sixty days, the lease may be terminated by either party.
