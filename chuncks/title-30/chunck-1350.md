#### § 1607. Critical minerals supply chains and reliability
##### (b) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) critical minerals are fundamental to the economy, competitiveness, and security of the United States;

(2) many critical minerals are only economic to recover when combined with the production of a host mineral;

(3) to the maximum extent practicable, the critical mineral needs of the United States should be satisfied by minerals responsibly produced and recycled in the United States; and

(4) the Federal permitting process has been identified as an impediment to mineral production and the mineral security of the United States.
