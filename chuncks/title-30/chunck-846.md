#### § 1026. Significant thermal features
##### (d) Lease stipulations

With respect to all leases or drilling permits issued, extended, renewed or modified under this chapter, the Secretary shall include stipulations in such leases and permits necessary to protect significant thermal features within units of the National Park System where the Secretary determines that, based on scientific evidence, the exploration, development or utilization of the land subject to the lease or drilling permit is reasonably likely to adversely affect any such significant thermal feature. Stipulations shall include, but not be limited to

(1) requiring the lessee to reinject geothermal fluids into the rock formations from which they originate;

(2) requiring the lessee to report annually to the Secretary on activities taken on the lease;

(3) requiring the lessee to continuously monitor geothermal resources production and injection wells; and

(4) requiring the lessee to suspend activity on the lease if the Secretary determines that ongoing exploration, development or utilization activities are having a significant adverse effect on a significant thermal feature within a unit of the National Park System until such time as the significant adverse effect is eliminated. The stipulation shall provide for the termination of the lease by the Secretary if the significant adverse effect cannot be eliminated within a reasonable period of time.
