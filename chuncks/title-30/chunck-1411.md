(1) 33-month period

Demands or orders issued by the Secretary or a delegated State are subject to administrative appeal in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary. No State shall impose any conditions which would hinder a lessee’s or its designee’s immediate appeal of an order to the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee. The Secretary shall issue a final decision in any administrative proceeding, including any administrative proceedings pending on August 13, 1996 , within 33 months from the date such proceeding was commenced or 33 months from August 13, 1996 , whichever is later. The 33-month period may be extended by any period of time agreed upon in writing by the Secretary and the appellant.

(2) Effect of failure to issue decision

If no such decision has been issued by the Secretary within the 33-month period referred to in paragraph (1)

(A) the Secretary shall be deemed to have issued and granted a decision in favor of the appellant as to any nonmonetary obligation and any monetary obligation the principal amount of which is less than $10,000; and

(B) the Secretary shall be deemed to have issued a final decision in favor of the Secretary, which decision shall be deemed to affirm those issues for which the agency rendered a decision prior to the end of such period, as to any monetary obligation the principal amount of which is $10,000 or more, and the appellant shall have a right to judicial review of such deemed final decision in accordance with title 5.
