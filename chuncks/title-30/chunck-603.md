#### § 869. Underground low- and medium-voltage alternating current circuits
##### (c) Inclusion of fail safe ground check circuits in resistance ground systems; operative functions; time extension; couplers for power circuits; guidelines for construction

Six months after the operative date of this subchapter, low- and medium-voltage resistance grounded systems shall include a fail safe ground check circuit to monitor continuously the grounding circuit to assure continuity which ground check circuit shall cause the circuit breaker to open when either the ground or pilot check wire is broken, or other no less effective device approved by the Secretary or his authorized representative to assure such continuity, except that an extension of time, not in excess of twelve months, may be permitted by the Secretary on a mine-by-mine basis if he determines that such equipment is not available. Cable couplers shall be constructed so that the ground check continuity conductor shall be broken first and the ground conductors shall be broken last when the coupler is being uncoupled.
