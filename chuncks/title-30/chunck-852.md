#### § 1028. Hot dry rock geothermal energy
##### (c) Update to geothermal resource assessment

The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the United States Geological Survey, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall update the 2008 United States geothermal resource assessment carried out by the United States Geological Survey, including

(1) with respect to areas previously identified by the Department of Energy or the United States Geological Survey as having significant potential for hydrothermal energy or enhanced geothermal systems energy, by focusing on

(A) improving the resolution of resource potential at systematic temperatures and depths, including temperatures and depths appropriate for power generation and direct use applications;

(B) quantifying the total potential to coproduce geothermal energy and minerals;

(C) incorporating data relevant to underground thermal energy storage and exchange, such as aquifer and soil properties; and

(D) producing high resolution maps, including

(i) maps that indicate key subsurface parameters for electric and direct use resources; and

(ii) risk maps for induced seismicity based on geologic, geographic, and operational parameters; and

(2) to the maximum extent practicable, by coordinating with relevant State officials and institutions of higher education to expand geothermal assessments, including enhanced geothermal systems assessments, to include assessments for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the States of Alaska and Hawaii.
