### CHAPTER 26— DEEP SEABED HARD MINERAL RESOURCES
#### § 1413. License and permit applications, review, and certification
##### (e) Other Federal agencies

The Administrator shall provide by regulation for full consultation and cooperation, prior to certification of an application for the issuance or transfer of any license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery and prior to the issuance or transfer of such a license or permit, with other Federal agencies or departments which have programs or activities within their statutory responsibilities which would be affected by the activities proposed in the application for the issuance or transfer of a license or permit. Not later than 30 days after June 28, 1980 , the heads of any Federal departments or agencies having expertise concerning, or jurisdiction over, any aspect of the recovery or processing of hard mineral resources shall transmit to the Administrator written comments as to their expertise or statutory responsibilities pursuant to this chapter or any other Federal law. To the extent possible, such agencies shall cooperate to reduce the number of separate actions required to satisfy the statutory responsibilities of these agencies. The Administrator shall transmit to each such agency or department a complete copy of each application and each such agency or department, based on its legal responsibilities and authorities, may, not later than 60 days after receipt of the application, recommend certification of the application, issuance or transfer of the license or permit, or denial of such certification, issuance, or transfer. In any case in which an agency or department recommends such a denial, it shall set forth in detail the manner in which the application does not comply with any law or regulation within its area of responsibility and shall indicate how the application may be amended, or how terms, conditions, or restrictions might be added to the license or permit, to assure compliance with such law or regulation.
