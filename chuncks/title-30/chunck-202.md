(2) improving the information regarding the value of public resources and revenues which should be expected from leasing;

(3) increasing competition among producers of coal, or products derived from the conversion of coal, by providing data and information to all potential bidders equally and equitably;

(4) providing the public with information on the nature of the coal deposits and the associated stratum and the value of the public resources being offered for sale; and

(5) providing the basis for the assessment of the amount of coal deposits in those lands subject to this chapter under subparagraph (B) of section 201(a)(3) of this title .
