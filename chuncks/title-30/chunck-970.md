### CHAPTER 25— SURFACE MINING CONTROL AND RECLAMATION
#### § 1244. Remining incentives
##### (a) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may, after opportunity for public comment, promulgate regulations that describe conditions under which amounts in the fund may be used to provide incentives to promote remining of eligible land under section 1234 of this title in a manner that leverages the use of amounts from the fund to achieve more reclamation with respect to the eligible land than would be achieved without the incentives.
