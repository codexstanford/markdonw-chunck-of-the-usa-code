### CHAPTER 3A— LEASES AND PROSPECTING PERMITS
#### § 188. Failure to comply with provisions of lease
##### (d) Additional grounds for reinstatement

(1) Where any oil and gas lease issued pursuant to section 226(b) of this title or the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands ( 30 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) has been, or is hereafter, terminated automatically by operation of law under this section for failure to pay on or before the anniversary date the full amount of the rental due, and such rental is not paid or tendered within twenty days thereafter, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior that such failure was justifiable or not due to lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the lessee, or, no matter when the rental is paid after termination, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such failure was inadvertent, the Secretary may reinstate the lease as of the date of termination for the unexpired portion of the primary term of the original lease or any extension thereof remaining at the date of termination, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities. In any case where a lease is reinstated under this subsection and the Secretary finds that the reinstatement of such lease (A) occurs after the expiration of the primary term or any extension thereof, or (B) will not afford the lessee a reasonable opportunity to continue operations under the lease, the Secretary may, at his discretion, extend the term of such lease for such period as he deems reasonable, but in no event for more than two years from the date the Secretary authorizes the reinstatement and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.

(2) No lease shall be reinstated under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless

(A) with respect to any lease that terminated under subsection (b) on or before August 8, 2005 , a petition for reinstatement (together with the required back rental and royalty accruing after the date of termination) is filed on or before the earlier of

(i) 60 days after the lessee receives from the Secretary notice of termination, whether by return of check or by any other form of actual notice; or

(ii) 15 months after the termination of the lease; or

(B) with respect to any lease that terminates under subsection (b) after August 8, 2005 , a petition for reinstatement (together with the required back rental and royalty accruing after the date of termination) is filed on or before the earlier of

(i) 60 days after receipt of the notice of termination sent by the Secretary by certified mail to all lessees of record; or

(ii) 24 months after the termination of the lease.
