#### § 1606. Mineral security
##### (i) Critical Materials Research Database and Information Portal

(1) In general

In carrying out the program established under subsection (g)(1), the Secretary and the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this subsection as the “Secretaries”), in consultation with the Director of the National Science Foundation, shall establish and operate a Critical Materials Information Portal (referred to in this subsection as the “Portal”) to collect, catalogue, disseminate, and archive information on critical materials.

(2) Cooperation

In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretaries shall leverage the expertise of the National Minerals Information Center, the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, and the Critical Materials Consortium established under subsection (g)(8)(A).

(3) Purpose

The purpose of the Portal is to support the development of a web-based platform to provide public access to a database of computed information on known and predicted critical materials and related material properties and computational tools in order

(A) to accelerate breakthroughs in critical materials identification and design;

(B) to strengthen the foundation for technologies that will enable more sustainable recycling, substitution, use, and recovery and minimize the environmental impacts of methods for extraction, processing, and manufacturing of critical materials; and

(C) to drive the development of advanced materials for applications that span the missions of the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior (referred to in this subsection as the “Departments”) in energy, environment, and national security.

(4) Activities

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretaries shall

(A) conduct cooperative research with industry, academia, and other research institutions to facilitate the design of novel materials, including critical materials and substitutes for critical materials;

(B) leverage existing high-performance computing systems to conduct high throughput calculations and develop computing and data mining algorithms for the prediction of material properties, including a focus on critical materials;

(C) leverage and support research in mineralogy and mineral chemistry to enhance the understanding, prediction, and manipulation of critical materials;

(D) assist scientists and engineers in making the fullest possible use of the relevant data holdings of the Departments, including the scientific and technical data generated by the research and development activities funded under subsection (g);

(E) seek and incorporate other information on critical materials to enhance the Departments’ utility for program participants and other users; and

(F) manage and make available to researchers and the public accessible, curated, standardized, secure, and privacy-protected data sets from the public and private sectors for the purposes of critical materials research and development activities.

(5) Proprietary information

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretaries shall ensure, consistent with section 1604(f) of this title , that

(A) no person uses the information and data collected for the Portal for a purpose other than the development of, or reporting of, aggregate data in a manner such that the identity of the person or firm who supplied the information is not discernible and is not material to the intended uses of the information;

(B) no person discloses any information or data collected for the Portal unless the information or data has been transformed into a statistical or aggregate form that does not allow the identification of the person or firm who supplied particular information; and

(C) procedures are established to require the withholding of any information or data collected for the Portal if at least 1 of the Secretaries determines that the withholding is necessary to protect proprietary information, including any trade secrets or other confidential information.
