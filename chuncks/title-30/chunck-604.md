Disconnecting devices shall be installed in conjunction with the circuit breaker to provide visual evidence that the power is disconnected. Trailing cables for mobile equipment shall contain one or more ground conductors having a cross sectional area of not less than one-half the power conductor, and, six months after the operative date of this subchapter, an insulated conductor for the ground continuity check circuit or other no less effective device approved by the Secretary or his authorized representative to assure such continuity, except that an extension of time, not in excess of twelve months may be permitted by the Secretary on a mine-by-mine basis if he determines that such equipment is not available. Splices made in the cables shall provide continuity of all components.
