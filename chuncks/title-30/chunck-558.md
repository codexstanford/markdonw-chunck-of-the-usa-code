(5) The Secretary shall promptly conduct a survey as to the total availability of new or rebuilt permissible electric face equipment and replacement parts for such equipment and, within six months after the operative date of this subchapter, publish the results of such survey.

(6) Any operator of a coal mine who is unable to comply with the provisions of paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection within one year after the operative date of this subchapter may file with the Panel an application for a permit for noncompliance. If the Panel determines that such application satisfies the provisions of paragraph (10) of this subsection, the Panel shall issue to such operator a permit for noncompliance.

(C) setting forth the actions taken from and after the operative date of this subchapter to comply with paragraph (1)(D) or paragraph (2) of this subsection, as appropriate, together with a plan setting forth a schedule of compliance with said paragraphs for each such equipment referred to in such paragraphs and being used by the operator in connection with mining operations in such mine with respect to which such permit is requested and the means and measures to be employed to achieve compliance; and

(D) including such other information as the Panel may require.

(11) No permit for noncompliance shall be issued under this subsection for any nonpermissible electric face equipment, unless such equipment was being used by an operator in connection with the mining operations in a coal mine on the operative date of this subchapter.

(12) Effective one year after the operative date of this subchapter, all replacement equipment acquired for use in any mine referred to in this subsection shall be permissible and shall be maintained in a permissible condition, and in the event of any major overhaul of any item of equipment in use one year from the operative date of this subchapter such equipment shall be put in, and thereafter maintained in, a permissible condition, unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, such equipment or necessary replacement parts are not available.
