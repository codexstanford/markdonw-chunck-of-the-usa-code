# Title 30— MINERAL LANDS AND MINING
### CHAPTER 29— OIL AND GAS ROYALTY MANAGEMENT
#### § 1701. Congressional statement of findings and purposes
###### (a) Congress finds that

(1) the Secretary of the Interior should enforce effectively and uniformly existing regulations under the mineral leasing laws providing for the inspection of production activities on lease sites on Federal and Indian lands;

(2) the system of accounting with respect to royalties and other payments due and owing on oil and gas produced from such lease sites is archaic and inadequate;

(3) it is essential that the Secretary initiate procedures to improve methods of accounting for such royalties and payments and to provide for routine inspection of activities related to the production of oil and gas on such lease sites; and

(4) the Secretary should aggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas.
