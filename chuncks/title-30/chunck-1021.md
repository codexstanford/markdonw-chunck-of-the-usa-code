### CHAPTER 25— SURFACE MINING CONTROL AND RECLAMATION
#### § 1260. Permit approval or denial
##### (e) Modification of prohibition

After October 24, 1992 , the prohibition of subsection (c) shall not apply to a permit application due to any violation resulting from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining under a permit held by the person making such application. As used in this subsection, the term “violation” has the same meaning as such term has under subsection (c).
