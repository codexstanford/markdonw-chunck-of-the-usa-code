##### (c) Compliance with State workmen’s compensation laws; conflicts between State and Federal provisions

Nothing in this subchapter shall relieve any operator of the duty to comply with any State workmen’s compensation law, except insofar as such State law is in conflict with the provisions of this subchapter and the Secretary by regulation, so prescribes. The provisions of any State workmen’s compensation law which provide greater benefits than the benefits payable under this subchapter shall not thereby be construed or held to be in conflict with the provisions of this subchapter.
