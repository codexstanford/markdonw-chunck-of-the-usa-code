##### (k) Education and workforce

(1) Workforce assessment

Not later than 1 year and 300 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary of Labor (in consultation with the Secretary, the Director of the National Science Foundation, institutions of higher education with substantial expertise in mining, institutions of higher education with significant expertise in minerals research, including fundamental research into alternatives, and employers in the critical minerals sector) shall submit to Congress an assessment of the domestic availability of technically trained personnel necessary for critical mineral exploration, development, assessment, production, manufacturing, recycling, analysis, forecasting, education, and research, including an analysis of

(A) skills that are in the shortest supply as of the date of the assessment;

(B) skills that are projected to be in short supply in the future;

(C) the demographics of the critical minerals industry and how the demographics will evolve under the influence of factors such as an aging workforce;

(D) the effectiveness of training and education programs in addressing skills shortages;

(E) opportunities to hire locally for new and existing critical mineral activities;

(F) the sufficiency of personnel within relevant areas of the Federal Government for achieving the policies described in section 1602 of this title ; and

(G) the potential need for new training programs to have a measurable effect on the supply of trained workers in the critical minerals industry.

(2) Curriculum study

(A) In general

The Secretary and the Secretary of Labor shall jointly enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering under which the Academies shall coordinate with the National Science Foundation on conducting a study

(i) to design an interdisciplinary program on critical minerals that will support the critical mineral supply chain and improve the ability of the United States to increase domestic, critical mineral exploration, development, production, manufacturing, research, including fundamental research into alternatives, and recycling;

(ii) to address undergraduate and graduate education, especially to assist in the development of graduate level programs of research and instruction that lead to advanced degrees with an emphasis on the critical mineral supply chain or other positions that will increase domestic, critical mineral exploration, development, production, manufacturing, research, including fundamental research into alternatives, and recycling;

(iii) to develop guidelines for proposals from institutions of higher education with substantial capabilities in the required disciplines for activities to improve the critical mineral supply chain and advance the capacity of the United States to increase domestic, critical mineral exploration, research, development, production, manufacturing, and recycling; and

(iv) to outline criteria for evaluating performance and recommendations for the amount of funding that will be necessary to establish and carry out the program described in paragraph (3).

(B) Report

Not later than 2 years after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall submit to Congress a description of the results of the study required under subparagraph (A).

(3) Program

(A) Establishment

The Secretary and the Secretary of Labor shall jointly conduct a competitive grant program under which institutions of higher education may apply for and receive 4-year grants for

(i) startup costs for newly designated faculty positions in integrated critical mineral education, research, innovation, training, and workforce development programs consistent with paragraph (2);

(ii) internships, scholarships, and fellowships for students enrolled in programs related to critical minerals;

(iii) equipment necessary for integrated critical mineral innovation, training, and workforce development programs; and

(iv) research of critical minerals and their applications, particularly concerning the manufacture of critical components vital to national security.

(B) Renewal

A grant under this paragraph shall be renewable for up to 2 additional 3-year terms based on performance criteria outlined under paragraph (2)(A)(iv).
