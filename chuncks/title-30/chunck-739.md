#### § 951. Studies and research
##### (f) Exceptions to mandatory health and safety standards for improving techniques and equipment

The Secretary is authorized to grant on a mine-by-mine basis an exception to any mandatory health or safety standard under this chapter for the purpose of permitting, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, accredited educational institutions the opportunity for experimenting with new and improved techniques and equipment to improve the health and safety of miners. No such exception shall be granted unless the Secretary finds that the granting of the exception will not adversely affect the health and safety of miners and publishes his findings.
