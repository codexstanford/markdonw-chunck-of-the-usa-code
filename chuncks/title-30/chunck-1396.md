### CHAPTER 29— OIL AND GAS ROYALTY MANAGEMENT
#### § 1721. Royalty terms and conditions, interest, and penalties
##### (h) Estimated payment

A lessee or its designee may make a payment for the approximate amount of royalties (hereinafter in this subsection “estimated payment”) that would otherwise be due for such lease by the date royalties are due for that lease. When an estimated payment is made, actual royalties are payable at the end of the month following the month in which the estimated payment is made. If the estimated payment was less than the amount of actual royalties due, interest is owed on the underpaid amount. If the lessee or its designee makes a payment for such actual royalties, the lessee or its designee may apply the estimated payment to future royalties. Any estimated payment may be adjusted, recouped, or reinstated at any time by the lessee or its designee.
