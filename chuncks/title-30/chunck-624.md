#### § 873. Blasting and explosives
##### (b) Storage of explosives and detonators; mudcaps in anthracite mines; restrictions; tests

Explosives and detonators shall be kept in separate containers until immediately before blasting. In underground anthracite mines, (1) mudcaps or other open, unconfined shake shots may be fired, if restricted to battery starting when methane or a fire hazard is not present, and if it is otherwise impracticable to start the battery; (2) open, unconfined shake shots in pitching veins may be fired, when no methane or fire hazard is present, if the taking down of loose hanging coal by other means is too hazardous; and (3) tests for methane shall be made immediately before such shots are fired and if 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane is present, when tested, such shot shall not be made until the methane content is reduced below 1.0 volume per centum.
