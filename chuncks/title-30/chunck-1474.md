### CHAPTER 32— METHANE HYDRATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
#### § 2003. Methane hydrate research and development program
##### (b) Grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, interagency funds transfer agreements, and field work proposals

(1) Assistance and coordination

In carrying out the program of methane hydrate research and development authorized by this section, the Secretary may award grants to, or enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with, institutions of higher education, oceanographic institutions, and industrial enterprises to

(A) conduct basic and applied research to identify, explore, assess, and develop methane hydrate as a commercially viable source of energy;

(B) identify methane hydrate resources through remote sensing;

(C) acquire and reprocess seismic data suitable for characterizing methane hydrate accumulations;

(D) assist in developing technologies required for efficient and environmentally sound development of methane hydrate resources;

(E) promote education and training in methane hydrate resource research and resource development through fellowships or other means for graduate education and training;

(F) conduct basic and applied research to assess and mitigate the environmental impact of hydrate degassing (including both natural degassing and degassing associated with commercial development);

(G) develop technologies to reduce the risks of drilling through methane hydrates; and

(H) conduct exploratory drilling, well testing, and production testing operations on permafrost and non-permafrost gas hydrates in support of the activities authorized by this paragraph, including drilling of one or more full-scale production test wells.

(2) Competitive peer review

Funds made available under paragraph (1) shall be made available based on a competitive process using external scientific peer review of proposed research.
