#### § 226–1. Extension of noncompetitive oil or gas lease issued before September 2, 1960
##### (a) Lands not withdrawn from leasing

Upon the expiration of the initial five-year term of any noncompetitive oil or gas lease which was issued prior to September 2, 1960 , and which has been maintained in accordance with applicable statutory requirements and regulations, the record titleholder thereof shall be entitled to a single extension of the lease, unless then otherwise provided by law, for such lands covered by it as are not, on the expiration date of the lease, withdrawn from leasing. A withdrawal, however, shall not affect the right to an extension if actual drilling operations on such lands were commenced prior to the effective date of the withdrawal and were being diligently prosecuted on the expiration date of the lease. No withdrawal shall be effective within the meaning of this section until ninety days after notice thereof has been sent by registered or certified mail to each lessee to be affected by such withdrawal.
