(2) Within 60 days after November 9, 1977 , the Secretary of Labor in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior shall establish an advisory committee under section 102 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 [ 30 U.S.C. 812 ] which shall, within 180 days after the date of the establishment of such advisory committee, review the advisory health and safety standards issued by the Secretary of the Interior under the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act and recommend to the Secretary of Labor which of those standards (or any modifications of such standards which do not substantially diminish the health and safety of miners) should be promulgated as mandatory health or safety standards. The Secretary of Labor shall publish, within 60 days after any recommendations of the advisory committee under this paragraph, each of the standards so recommended for adoption with or without modifications as a proposed mandatory health or safety standard under this section by publication of such standard in the Federal Register, and afford interested persons a period of 25 days after publication to submit written data or comment. Within 30 days after the close of the comment period specified in the preceding sentence, the Secretary of Labor shall promulgate by publication in the Federal Register mandatory health or safety standards based upon the advisory committee recommendation with or without modification, and the data and comments received thereon, unless the Secretary of Labor determines that such standards will not promote the health and safety of miners and publishes an explanation of that determination in the Federal Register.
