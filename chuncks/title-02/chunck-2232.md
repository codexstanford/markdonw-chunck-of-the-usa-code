#### § 6314. Mail, telegraph, telephone, stationery, office supplies, and home State office and travel expenses for Senators
##### (j) Advances from Senate contingent fund for travel expenses for official business trips; vouchers; settlement

Whenever a Senator or employee of his office plans an official business trip with respect to which reimbursement for travel expenses is authorized under the preceding provisions of section (a), the Senator (or such an employee who has been designated by the Senator to do so) may, prior to the commencement of such trip and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, obtain from any moneys in the contingent fund of the Senate which are available to him for purposes specified in subsection (a)(6) of this section, such advance sum as he shall certify (and be accountable for), to the Secretary of the Senate, to be necessary to defray some or all of the expenses to be incurred on such trip which expenses are reimbursable under the preceding provisions of this section. The receipt by any Senator for any sum so advanced to him or his order out of the contingent fund of the Senate by the Secretary of the Senate shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the Government as a full and sufficient voucher; but it shall be the duty of such Senator (or employee of his office, as the case may be), as soon as practicable, to furnish to the Secretary of the Senate a detailed voucher of the expenses incurred for the travel with respect to which the sum was so advanced, and make settlement with respect to such sum.
