##### (b) Findings

Congress finds the following:

(1) The legislative branch, as a separate and equal branch of the United States Government, is a target of adversary cyber actors and intelligence services.

(2) The legislative branch relies on the executive branch to provide timely and urgent tactical and operational information to ensure that Congress can protect the constitutional officers, personnel, and facilities of Congress and the institution of Congress more broadly.

(3) The legislative branch currently is not receiving this information in a timely manner nor as a matter of course.
