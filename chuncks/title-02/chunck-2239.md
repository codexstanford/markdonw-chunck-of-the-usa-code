##### (f) Mobile office

(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5), a Senator may lease one mobile office for use only in the State he represents and the contingent fund of the Senate is available for the rental payments (including by way of reimbursement) made under such lease together with the actual nonpersonnel cost of operating such mobile office. The term of any such lease shall not exceed 3 years. A copy of each such lease shall be furnished to the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate.

(2) The maximum aggregate annual rental payments and operating costs (except furniture, equipment, and furnishings) that may be paid to a Senator under paragraph (1) shall not at any time exceed an amount determined by multiplying (A) the highest applicable rate per square foot charged Federal agencies by the Administrator of General Services in the State which that Senator represents, based upon a 100 percent building quality rating, by (B) the maximum aggregate square feet of office space to which that Senator is entitled under subsection (b) reduced by the number of square feet contained in offices secured for that Senator under subsection (a) and used by that Senator and his employees to perform their duties.

(3) No payment shall be made under paragraph (1) for rental payments and operating costs of a mobile office of a Senator unless the following provisions are included in its lease:

(A) Liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 shall be provided with respect to the operation and use of such mobile office.

(B) Either of the following inscriptions shall be clearly visible on three sides of such mobile office in letters not less than three inches high: “UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT VEHICLE

“FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY”;

Or

“MOBILE OFFICE OF SENATOR _____

“FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY”.

The Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate may prescribe regulations to waive or modify the requirement under subparagraph (B) if such waiver or modification is necessary to provide for the public safety of a Senator and the Senator’s staff and constituents.

(4) No payment shall be made under paragraph (1) for rental payments and operating costs of a mobile office of a Senator which are attributable to or incurred during the 60-day period ending with the date of any primary or general election (whether regular, special, or runoff) in which that Senator is a candidate for public office, unless his candidacy in such election is uncontested.

(5) Payment under paragraph (1) shall be made on a monthly basis and shall be paid upon vouchers approved by the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate.
