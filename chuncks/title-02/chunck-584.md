### CHAPTER 17A— CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET AND FISCAL OPERATIONS
#### § 643. Determinations and points of order
##### (e) Points of order in Senate against amendments between Houses

Each provision of this Act that establishes a point of order against an amendment also establishes a point of order in the Senate against an amendment between the Houses. If a point of order under this Act is raised in the Senate against an amendment between the Houses and the point of order is sustained, the effect shall be the same as if the Senate had disagreed to the amendment.
