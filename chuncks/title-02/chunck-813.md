#### § 936. Adjustment for current policies
##### (d) Estate and Gift Tax

(1) Criteria

Legislation that includes provisions amending the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of title 26 shall trigger the current policy adjustment required by this chapter.

(2) Adjustment

The amount of the maximum current policy adjustment shall be the difference between

(A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009 , to be in effect); and

(B) what those revenue collections would have been if, on the date of enactment of the legislation meeting the criteria in paragraph (1), estate and gift tax law had instead been amended so that the tax rates, nominal exemption amounts, and related parameters in effect for tax year 2009 had remained in effect through December 31, 2011 , with nominal exemption amounts indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with subsection (g).

(3) Limitation

If the provisions in the legislation that cause it to meet the criteria in paragraph (1) cover a time period that ends before December 31, 2011 , subject to the maximum adjustment provided for under paragraph (2), the amount of each current policy adjustment made pursuant to this section shall be limited to the difference between

(A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009 , to be in effect for the period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation); and

(B) what those revenues would have been if the estate and gift tax law rates, nominal exemption amounts, and related parameters in effect for 2009, with nominal exemption amounts indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with subsection (g), had been in effect for the same period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation as under subparagraph (A).

(4) Duration of policy adjustment

Adjustments made pursuant to this subsection are available for policies affecting the estate and gift tax through only December 31, 2011 . Any adjustments shall include budgetary effects in all years from these policy changes.
