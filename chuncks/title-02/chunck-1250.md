(A) when the Architect first enters into an agreement with a State, a request for withholdings shall be effective on such date as the Architect may determine; and

Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the first pay period commencing on or after the day on which the request for change or the revocation is received in the appropriate office.

(4) The Architect is authorized to issue rules and regulations he considers appropriate in carrying out this subsection.
