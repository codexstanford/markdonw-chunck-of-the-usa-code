To achieve the total percentage reduction in those programs required by section 902 or 903 of this title, subject to paragraph (2), and notwithstanding section 710 of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 911 ], OMB shall determine, and the applicable Presidential order under section 904 of this title shall implement, the percentage reduction that shall apply, with respect to the health insurance programs under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.]

(A) in the case of parts A and B of such title [ 42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq., 1395j et seq.], to individual payments for services furnished during the one-year period beginning on the first day of the first month beginning after the date the order is issued (or, if later, the date specified in paragraph (4)); and

(B) in the case of parts C and D [ 42 U.S.C. 1395w–21 et seq., 1395w–101 et seq.], to monthly payments under contracts under such parts for the same one-year period; such that the reduction made in payments under that order shall achieve the required total percentage reduction in those payments for that period.

(2) Uniform reduction rate; maximum permissible reduction

Reductions in payments for programs and activities under such title XVIII [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] pursuant to a sequestration order under section 904 of this title shall be at a uniform rate, which shall not exceed 4 percent, across all such programs and activities subject to such order.

(3) Timing of application of reductions

In the case in which payment for services of a provider of services is made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] on a basis relating to the reasonable cost incurred for the services during a cost reporting period of the provider, if a reduction is made under paragraph (1) in payment amounts pursuant to a sequestration order, the reduction shall be applied to payment for costs for such services incurred at any time during each cost reporting period of the provider any part of which occurs during the effective period of the order, but only (for each such cost reporting period) in the same proportion as the fraction of the cost reporting period that occurs during the effective period of the order.

(4) Timing of subsequent sequestration order

A sequestration order required by section 902 or 903 of this title with respect to programs under such title XVIII [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] shall not take effect until the first month beginning after the end of the effective period of any prior sequestration order with respect to such programs, as determined in accordance with paragraph (1).
