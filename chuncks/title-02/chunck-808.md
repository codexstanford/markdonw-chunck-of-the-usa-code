### CHAPTER 20A— STATUTORY PAY-AS-YOU-GO
#### § 935. Calculating a sequestration
##### (a) Reducing nonexempt budgetary resources by a uniform percentage

(1) In general

OMB shall calculate the uniform percentage by which the budgetary resources of nonexempt direct spending programs are to be sequestered such that the outlay savings resulting from that sequestration, as calculated under subsection (b), shall offset the budget-year debit, if any, on the applicable PAYGO scorecard. If the uniform percentage calculated under the prior sentence exceeds 4 percent, the Medicare programs described in section 906(d) of this title shall be reduced by 4 percent and the uniform percentage by which the budgetary resources of all other nonexempt direct spending programs are to be sequestered shall be increased, as necessary, so that the sequestration of Medicare and of all other nonexempt direct spending programs together produce the required outlay savings.

(2) Programs and activities in unified budget only

Subject to the exemptions set forth in section 11, 1 OMB shall determine the uniform percentage required under paragraph (1) with respect to programs and activities contained in the unified budget only.
