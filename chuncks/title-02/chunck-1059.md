# Title 2— THE CONGRESS
### CHAPTER 25— UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM
#### § 1513. Impact on local governments
##### (a) Findings

The Senate finds that

(1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs from Federal to State and local authorities and should be equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to shift costs to local governments;

(2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in many instances, forced local governments to raise property taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and

(3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, secure community.
