#### § 901a. Enforcement of budget goal

Discretionary appropriations and direct spending accounts shall be reduced in accordance with this section as follows:

(1) Calculation of total deficit reduction

OMB shall calculate the amount of the deficit reduction required by this section for each of fiscal years 2013 through 2021 by

(A) starting with $1,200,000,000,000;

(B) subtracting the amount of deficit reduction achieved by the enactment of a joint committee bill, as provided in section 401(b)(3)(B)(i)(II) of the Budget Control Act of 2011;

(C) reducing the difference by 18 percent to account for debt service;

(D) dividing the result by 9; and

(E) for fiscal year 2013, reducing the amount calculated under subparagraphs (A) through (D) by $24,000,000,000.

(2) Allocation to functions

On March 1, 2013 , for fiscal year 2013, and in its sequestration preview report for fiscal years 2014 through 2021 pursuant to section 904(c) of this title , OMB shall allocate half of the total reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (1) for that year to discretionary appropriations and direct spending accounts within function 050 (defense function) and half to accounts in all other functions (nondefense functions).

(3) Defense function reduction

OMB shall calculate the reductions to discretionary appropriations and direct spending for each of fiscal years 2013 through 2021 for defense function spending as follows:

(A) Discretionary

OMB shall calculate the reduction to discretionary appropriations by

(i) taking the total reduction for the defense function allocated for that year under paragraph (2);

(ii) multiplying by the discretionary spending limit for the revised security category for that year; and

(iii) dividing by the sum of the discretionary spending limit for the security category and OMB’s baseline estimate of nonexempt outlays for direct spending programs within the defense function for that year.

(B) Direct spending

OMB shall calculate the reduction to direct spending by taking the total reduction for the defense function required for that year under paragraph (2) and subtracting the discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to subparagraph (A).

(4) Nondefense function reduction

OMB shall calculate the reduction to discretionary appropriations and to direct spending for each of fiscal years 2013 through 2021 for programs in nondefense functions as follows:

(A) Discretionary

OMB shall calculate the reduction to discretionary appropriations by

(i) taking the total reduction for nondefense functions allocated for that year under paragraph (2);

(ii) multiplying by the discretionary spending limit for the revised nonsecurity category for that year; and

(iii) dividing by the sum of the discretionary spending limit for the revised nonsecurity category and OMB’s baseline estimate of nonexempt outlays for direct spending programs in nondefense functions for that year.

(B) Direct spending

OMB shall calculate the reduction to direct spending programs by taking the total reduction for nondefense functions required for that year under paragraph (2) and subtracting the discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to subparagraph (A).

(5) Implementing discretionary reductions

(A) Fiscal year 2013

On March 1, 2013 , for fiscal year 2013, OMB shall calculate and the President shall order a sequestration, effective upon issuance and under the procedures set forth in section 903(f) of this title , to reduce each account within the security category or nonsecurity category by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of budgetary resources in that account at that time by a uniform percentage necessary to achieve

(i) for the revised security category, an amount equal to the defense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (3); and

(ii) for the revised nonsecurity category, an amount equal to the nondefense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (4).

(B) Fiscal years 2014–2021

Except as provided by paragraphs (10), (11), (12), and (13), on the date of the submission of its sequestration preview report for fiscal years 2014 through 2021 pursuant to section 904(c) of this title for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2021, OMB shall reduce the discretionary spending limit
