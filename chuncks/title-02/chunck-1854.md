### CHAPTER 45— CONGRESSIONAL PAY AND BENEFITS
#### § 4575. Gross rate of compensation of employees paid by Secretary of Senate
##### (b) Conversion; increase in compensation

The rate of compensation of each employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate which was fixed before August 1, 1967 , at a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is payable by law shall be converted as of such date to the lowest per annum gross rate which is a multiple of $180 and which is not less than the aggregate rate of compensation (basic compensation plus additional compensation provided by law) which such employee was receiving immediately prior to such date. Any increments of longevity compensation to which an employee became entitled prior to August 1, 1967 , under section 4507(b) of this title shall be excluded in converting such employee’s rate of compensation under this subsection, but such employee’s rate of gross compensation shall be increased by $540 (which shall be considered to be an increase under section 4507(b) of this title ) for each such increment.
