### CHAPTER 24— CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY
#### § 1417. Option to request remote work assignment or paid leave of absence during pendency of procedures
##### (a) Options for employees

(1) Remote work assignment

At the request of a covered employee who files a claim alleging a violation of part A of subchapter II by the covered employee’s employing office, during the pendency of any of the procedures available under this subchapter for consideration of the claim, the employing office may permit the covered employee to carry out the employee’s responsibilities from a remote location (referred to in this section as “permitting a remote work assignment”) where such relocation would have the effect of materially reducing interactions between the covered employee and any person alleged to have committed the violation, instead of from a location of the employing office.

(2) Exception for work assignments required to be carried out onsite

If, in the determination of the covered employee’s employing office, a covered employee who makes a request under this subsection cannot carry out the employee’s responsibilities from a remote location or such relocation would not have the effect described in paragraph (1), the employing office may during the pendency of the procedures described in paragraph (1)

(A) grant a paid leave of absence to the covered employee;

(B) permit a remote work assignment and grant a paid leave of absence to the covered employee; or

(C) make another workplace adjustment, or permit a remote work assignment, that would have the effect of reducing interactions between the covered employee and any person alleged to have committed the violation described in paragraph (1).

(3) Ensuring no retaliation

An employing office may not grant a covered employee’s request under this subsection in a manner which would constitute a violation of section 1317 of this title .

(4) No impact on vacation or personal leave

In granting leave for a paid leave of absence under this section, an employing office shall not require the covered employee to substitute, for that leave, any of the accrued paid vacation or personal leave of the covered employee.
