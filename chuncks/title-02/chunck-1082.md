#### § 1552. Report on Federal mandates by Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
##### (a) In general

The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations shall in accordance with this section

(1) investigate and review the role of Federal mandates in intergovernmental relations and their impact on State, local, tribal, and Federal government objectives and responsibilities, and their impact on the competitive balance between State, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector and consider views of and the impact on working men and women on those same matters;

(2) investigate and review the role of unfunded State mandates imposed on local governments;

(3) make recommendations to the President and the Congress regarding

(A) allowing flexibility for State, local, and tribal governments in complying with specific Federal mandates for which terms of compliance are unnecessarily rigid or complex;

(B) reconciling any 2 or more Federal mandates which impose contradictory or inconsistent requirements;

(C) terminating Federal mandates which are duplicative, obsolete, or lacking in practical utility;

(D) suspending, on a temporary basis, Federal mandates which are not vital to public health and safety and which compound the fiscal difficulties of State, local, and tribal governments, including recommendations for triggering such suspension;

(E) consolidating or simplifying Federal mandates, or the planning or reporting requirements of such mandates, in order to reduce duplication and facilitate compliance by State, local, and tribal governments with those mandates;

(F) establishing common Federal definitions or standards to be used by State, local, and tribal governments in complying with Federal mandates that use different definitions or standards for the same terms or principles; and

(G)

(i) the mitigation of negative impacts on the private sector that may result from relieving State, local, and tribal governments from Federal mandates (if and to the extent that such negative impacts exist on the private sector); and

(ii) the feasibility of applying relief from Federal mandates in the same manner and to the same extent to private sector entities as such relief is applied to State, local, and tribal governments; and

(4) identify and consider in each recommendation made under paragraph (3), to the extent practicable

(A) the specific Federal mandates to which the recommendation applies, including requirements of the departments, agencies, and other entities of the Federal Government that State, local, and tribal governments utilize metric systems of measurement; and

(B) any negative impact on the private sector that may result from implementation of the recommendation.
