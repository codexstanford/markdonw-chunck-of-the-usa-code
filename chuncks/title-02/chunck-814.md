### CHAPTER 20A— STATUTORY PAY-AS-YOU-GO
#### § 936. Adjustment for current policies
##### (e) AMT relief

(1) Criteria

Legislation that includes provisions extending AMT relief shall trigger the current policy adjustment required by this chapter.

(2) Adjustment

The amount of the maximum current policy adjustment shall be the difference between

(A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009 , to be in effect); and

(B) what those revenue collections would have been if, on the date of enactment of legislation meeting the criteria in paragraph (1), AMT law had instead been amended by making commensurate adjustments in the exemption amounts for joint and single filers in such a manner that the number of taxpayers with AMT liability or lost credits that occur as a result of the AMT would not be estimated to exceed the number of taxpayers affected by the AMT in tax year 2008 in any year for which relief is provided, through December 31, 2011 .

(3) Limitation

If the provisions in the legislation that cause it to meet the criteria in paragraph (1) cover a time period that ends before December 31, 2011 , subject to the maximum adjustment provided for under paragraph (2), the amount of each current policy adjustment made pursuant to this section shall be limited to the difference between

(A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009 , to be in effect for the period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation); and

(B) what those revenues would have been if, on the date of enactment of legislation meeting the criteria in paragraph (1), AMT law had instead been amended by making commensurate adjustments in the exemption amounts for joint and single filers in such a manner that the number of taxpayers with AMT liability or lost credits that occur as a result of the AMT would not be estimated to exceed the number of AMT taxpayers in tax year 2008 for the same period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation as under subparagraph (A).

(4) Duration of policy adjustment

Adjustments made pursuant to this subsection are available for policies affecting the AMT through only December 31, 2011 . Any adjustments shall include budgetary effects in all years from these policy changes.
