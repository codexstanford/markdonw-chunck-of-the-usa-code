(1) In general

For any provision of legislation that meets the criteria in subsection (c), (d), (e) or (f) of section 936 of this title , the Chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the House and Senate, as applicable, shall request that CBO adjust the estimate of budgetary effects of that legislation pursuant to paragraph (2) for the purposes of this chapter. A single piece of legislation may contain provisions that meet criteria in more than one of the subsections referred to in the preceding sentence. CBO shall adjust estimates for legislation designated under subsection (a) and estimated under subsection (b). OMB shall adjust estimates for legislation estimated under subsection (d)(3).

(2) Adjustments

(A) Estimates

CBO or OMB, as applicable, shall exclude from the estimate of budgetary effects any budgetary effects of a provision that meets the criteria in subsection (c), (d), (e) or (f) of section 936 of this title , to the extent that those budgetary effects, when combined with all other excluded budgetary effects of any other previously designated provisions of enacted legislation under the same subsection of section 936 of this title , do not exceed the maximum applicable current policy adjustment defined under the applicable subsection of section 936 of this title for the applicable 10-year period.

(B) Baseline

Any estimate made pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be prepared using baseline estimates supplied by the Congressional Budget Office, consistent with section 907 of this title . CBO estimates of legislation adjusted for current policy shall include a separate presentation of costs excluded from the calculation of budgetary effects for the legislation, as well as an updated total of all excluded costs of provisions within subsection (c), (d), or (e) of section 936 of this title , as applicable, and in the case of paragraph (1) of section 936(f) of this title , within any of the subparagraphs (A) through (L) of such paragraph, as applicable.

(3) Limitation on availability of excess savings

(A) Prohibition on use of excess saving  2 for ineligible policies

To the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision estimated under this subsection exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that provision, these excess savings shall not be available to offset the costs of any provisions not otherwise eligible for a current policy adjustment under section 936 of this title , and shall not be counted on the PAYGO scorecards established pursuant to subsections (d)(4) and (d)(5).

(B) Prohibition on use of excess savings across budget areas

For provisions eligible for a current policy adjustment under subsections (c) through (f) of section 936 of this title , to the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that same provision, the excess savings shall be available only to offset the costs of other provisions that qualify for a current policy adjustment in that same subsection. Each paragraph in section 936(f)(1) of this title shall be considered a separate subsection for purposes of this section.

(4) Further guidance on estimating budgetary effects

Estimates of budgetary effects under this subsection shall be consistent with the guidance provided at section 936(h) of this title .

(5) Inclusion of statement

For PAYGO legislation adjusted pursuant to section 936 of this title , the Chairman of the House or Senate Budget Committee, as applicable, shall include in any statement titled “Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation”, submitted for that legislation pursuant to this section, an explanation of the current policy designation and adjustments.
