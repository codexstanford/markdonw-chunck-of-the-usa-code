#### § 633. Committee allocations
##### (a) Committee spending allocations

(1) Allocation among committees

The joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget shall include an allocation, consistent with the resolution recommended in the conference report, of the levels for the first fiscal year of the resolution, for at least each of the ensuing 4 fiscal years, and a total for that period of fiscal years (except in the case of the Committee on Appropriations only for the fiscal year of that resolution) of

(A) total new budget authority; and

(B) total outlays; among each committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate that has jurisdiction over legislation providing or creating such amounts.

(2) No double counting

In the House of Representatives, any item allocated to one committee may not be allocated to another committee.

(3) Further division of amounts

(A) In the Senate

In the Senate, the amount allocated to the Committee on Appropriations shall be further divided among the categories specified in section 900(c)(4) of this title and shall not exceed the limits for each category set forth in section 901(c) of this title .

(B) In the House

In the House of Representatives, the amounts allocated to each committee for each fiscal year, other than the Committee on Appropriations, shall be further divided between amounts provided or required by law on the date of filing of that conference report and amounts not so provided or required. The amounts allocated to the Committee on Appropriations shall be further divided

(i) between discretionary and mandatory amounts or programs, as appropriate; and

(ii) consistent with the categories specified in section 900(c)(4) of this title .

(4) Amounts not allocated

In the House of Representatives or the Senate, if a committee receives no allocation of new budget authority or outlays, that committee shall be deemed to have received an allocation equal to zero for new budget authority or outlays.

(5) Adjusting allocation of discretionary spending in the House of Representatives

(A) If a concurrent resolution on the budget is not adopted by April 15, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives shall submit to the House, as soon as practicable, an allocation under paragraph (1) to the Committee on Appropriations consistent with the discretionary spending levels in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for the appropriate fiscal year covered by that resolution.

(B) As soon as practicable after an allocation under paragraph (1) is submitted under this section, the Committee on Appropriations shall make suballocations and report those suballocations to the House of Representatives.
