The request for withholdings is effective on the first day of the first month commencing after the day on which the request is received in the Disbursing Office of the Senate, except that

(A) when the Secretary first enters into an agreement with a State, a request for withholdings shall be effective on such date as the Secretary may determine; and

(3) An individual may change the State designated by him for the purposes of having withholdings made and request that the withholdings be remitted in accordance with such change, and he may also revoke his request for withholdings. Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the first month commencing after the day on which the request for change or the revocation is received in the Disbursing Office.

(4) The Secretary is authorized to issue rules and regulations he considers appropriate in carrying out this subsection.
