The Secretary shall make such payments as may be mutually agreed to by the Secretary and the Governor pursuant to such negotiations.

(2) The Secretary shall place all lease payments made by the United States under the lease in an interest bearing escrow account in American Samoa.

The High Court of American Samoa shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the amount to be disbursed under this section to any person.

If the amounts deposited in such account, together with interest thereon, exceeds  1 the amount of the lease payments due and payable at the time the agreement is entered into, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the excess shall be transferred to the accounts provided to the Secretary for operation and maintenance and for development of the park.
