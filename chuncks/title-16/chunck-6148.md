#### § 839e. Rates
##### (m) Impact aid payments; formula

(1) Beginning the first fiscal year after the plan and program required by section 839b(d) and (h) of this title are finally adopted, the Administrator may, subject to the provisions of this section, make annual impact aid payments to the appropriate local governments within the region with respect to major transmission facilities of the Administrator, as defined in section 3(c) of the Federal Columbia River Transmission Act [ 16 U.S.C. 838a(c) ]

(A) which are located within the jurisdictional boundaries of such governments,

(B) which are determined by the Administrator to have a substantial impact on such governments, and

(C) where the construction of such facilities, or any modification thereof, is completed after December 5, 1980 , and, in the case of a modification of an existing facility, such modification substantially increases the capacity of such existing transmission facility.

(2) Payments made under this subsection for any fiscal year shall be determined by the Administrator pursuant to a regionwide, uniform formula to be established by rule in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (i) of this section. Such rule shall become effective on its approval, after considering its effect on rates established pursuant to this section, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In developing such formula, the Administrator shall identify, and take into account, the local governmental services provided to the Administrator concerning such facilities and the associated costs to such governments as the result of such facilities.

(3) Payments made pursuant to this subsection shall be made solely from the fund established by section 11 of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act [ 16 U.S.C. 838i ]. The provisions of section 13 of such Act [ 16 U.S.C. 838k ], and any appropriations provided to the Administrator under any law, shall not be available for such payments. The authorization of payments under this subsection shall not be construed as an obligation of the United States.

(4) No payment may be made under this subsection with respect to any land or interests in land owned by the United States within the region and administered by any Federal agency (other than the Administrator), without regard to how the United States obtained ownership thereof, including lands or interests therein acquired or withdrawn by a Federal agency for purposes of such agency and subsequently made available to the Administrator for such facilities.
