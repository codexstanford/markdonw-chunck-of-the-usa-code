An application by any public body or cooperative for an allocation of electric energy shall not be denied, or another application competing or in conflict therewith be granted, to any private corporation, company, agency, or person, on the ground that any proposed bond or other security issue of any such public body or cooperative, the sale of which is necessary to enable such prospective purchaser to enter into the public business of selling and distributing the electric energy proposed to be purchased, has not been authorized or marketed, until after a reasonable time, to be determined by the administrator, has been afforded such public body or cooperative to have such bond or other security issue authorized or marketed.
