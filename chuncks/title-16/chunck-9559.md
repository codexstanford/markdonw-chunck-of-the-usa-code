### CHAPTER 84— HEALTHY FOREST RESTORATION
#### § 6591. Forest stands inventory and monitoring program to improve detection of and response to environmental threats
##### (c) Early warning system

In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall develop a comprehensive early warning system for potential catastrophic environmental threats to forests to increase the likelihood that forest managers will be able to

(1) isolate and treat a threat before the threat gets out of control; and

(2) prevent epidemics, such as the American chestnut blight in the first half of the twentieth century, that could be environmentally and economically devastating to forests.
