### CHAPTER 31— MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION
#### § 1383a. Interim exemption for commercial fisheries
##### (g) Review of information and evaluation of effects of incidental taking on population stocks of marine mammals; promulgation of emergency regulations to mitigate immediate and significant adverse impacts; action to mitigate non-immediate impacts

(1) The Secretary shall review information regarding the incidental taking of marine mammals and evaluate the effects of such incidental taking on the affected population stocks of marine mammals.

(2) If the Secretary finds, based on the information received from the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is having an immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population stock or, in the case of Steller sea lions and North Pacific fur seals, that more than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will be incidentally killed during a calendar year, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils and State fishery managers and prescribe emergency regulations to prevent to the maximum extent practicable any further taking. Any emergency regulations prescribed under this paragraph

(A) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering with existing State or regional fishery management plans;

(B) shall be published in the Federal Register together with the reasons therefor;

(C) shall remain in effect for not more than one hundred and eighty days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is earlier; and

(D) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination if the Secretary determines the reasons for the emergency regulations no longer exist. In prescribing emergency regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account the economics of the fishery concerned and the availability of existing technology to prevent or minimize incidental taking of marine mammals.

(3) If the Secretary finds, based on information received from the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), that incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is not having an immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population stock but that it will likely have a significant adverse impact over a period of time longer than one year, the Secretary shall request the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council or State to initiate, recommend, or take such action within its authority as it considers necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts, including adjustments to requirements on fishing times or areas or the imposition of restrictions on the use of vessels or gear.

(4) The Secretary shall impose appropriate conditions and restrictions on an exemption granted under subsection (b) if

(A) a Regional Fishery Management Council or State does not act in a reasonable period of time on a request made by the Secretary under paragraph (3); or

(B) if the Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for public comment that the purposes of this section would be better served by such action.
