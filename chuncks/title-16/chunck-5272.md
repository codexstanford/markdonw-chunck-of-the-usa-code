#### § 715s. Participation of local governments in revenue from areas administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
##### (c) Payment to counties
######## (A) For purposes of determining the fair market value of fee areas under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall

(i) appraise before September 30, 1979 , all fee areas for which payments under this section were not authorized for fiscal years occurring before October 1, 1977 ; and

(ii) appraise all other fee areas, within five years after October 17, 1978 , in the order in which such areas were first established by the Service. After initial appraisal under clause (i) or (ii), each fee area shall thereafter be reappraised by the Secretary at least once during each five-year period occurring after the date of the initial appraisal. Until any fee area referred to in clause (ii) is initially appraised under this subparagraph, the fair market value of such area shall be deemed to be that adjusted cost of the area which was used to determine payments under this subsection for fiscal year 1977; and in no case may the amount of any payment to any local government under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to any fee area be less than the amount paid under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection (as in effect on September 30, 1977 ) with respect to such area.

(B) The Secretary shall make the determinations required under this subsection in such manner as the Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public interest. All such determinations shall be final and conclusive.

(5)

(A) Each county which receives payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to any fee area or reserve area shall distribute, under guidelines established by the Secretary, such payments on a proportional basis to those units of local government (including, but not limited to, school districts and the county itself in appropriate cases) which have incurred the loss or reduction of real property tax revenues by reason of the existence of such area. In any case in which a unit of local government other than the county acts as the collecting and distributing agency for real property taxes, the payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made to such other unit which shall distribute the payments in accordance with the guidelines.

(B) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments under this paragraph may be made to units of local government in cases in which subparagraph (A) will not effect the purposes of this paragraph.

(C) Payments received by units of local government under this subsection may be used by such units for any governmental purpose.
