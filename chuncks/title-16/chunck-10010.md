### CHAPTER 100— NUTRIA ERADICATION AND CONTROL
#### § 8101. Findings and purposes
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds the following:

(1) Wetlands, tidal marshes, and agricultural lands provide significant cultural, economic, and ecological benefits to the Nation.

(2) The South American nutria (Myocastor coypus) is directly contributing to substantial marsh loss on Federal, State, and private land.

(3) Traditional harvest methods to control or eradicate nutria have failed. Consequently, marsh loss, loss of public and private wetlands, and loss of agricultural lands are accelerating.

(4) The nutria eradication and control pilot program authorized by Public Law 105–322 is to develop new and effective methods for eradication of nutria.
