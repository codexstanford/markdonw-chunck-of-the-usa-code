(1) Upon making a finding under subsection (a) that a State has failed to carry out its responsibility under section 5104 of this title and that the measures it failed to implement and enforce are necessary for conservation, the Secretary shall declare a moratorium on fishing in the fishery in question within the waters of the noncomplying State. The Secretary shall specify the moratorium’s effective date, which shall be any date within 6 months after declaration of the moratorium.

If so, the moratorium shall be terminated.
