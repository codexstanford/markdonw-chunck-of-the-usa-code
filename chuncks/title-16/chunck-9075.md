### CHAPTER 67— AQUATIC NUISANCE PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 4722. Aquatic nuisance species program
##### (i) Zebra mussel demonstration program

(1) Zebra mussel

(A) In general

The Task Force shall, within the program developed under subsection (a), undertake a program of prevention, monitoring, control, education and research for the zebra mussel to be implemented in the Great Lakes and any other waters of the United States infested or likely to become infested by the zebra mussel, including

(i) research and development concerning the species life history, environmental tolerances and impacts on fisheries and other ecosystem components, and the efficacy of control mechanisms and means of avoiding or minimizing impacts;

(ii) tracking the dispersal of the species and establishment of an early warning system to alert likely areas of future infestations;

(iii) development of control plans in coordination with regional, State and local entities; and

(iv) provision of technical assistance to regional, State and local entities to carry out this section.

(B) Public facility research and development

The Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Task Force, shall develop a program of research, technology development, and demonstration for the environmentally sound control of zebra mussels in and around public facilities. The Assistant Secretary shall collect and make available, through publications and other appropriate means, information pertaining to such control methods.

(C) Voluntary guidelines

Not later than 1 year after October 26, 1996 , the Task Force shall develop and submit to the Secretary voluntary guidelines for controlling the spread of the zebra mussel and, if appropriate, other aquatic nuisance species through recreational activities, including boating and fishing. Not later than 4 months after the date of such submission, and after providing notice and an opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall issue voluntary guidelines that are based on the guidelines developed by the Task Force under this subparagraph.

(2) Dispersal containment analysis

(A) Research

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with the National Science Foundation and the Task Force, shall provide research grants on a competitive basis for projects that

(i) identify environmentally sound methods for controlling the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species, such as the zebra mussel; and

(ii) adhere to research protocols developed pursuant to subsection (f)(2).

(B) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out this paragraph, $500,000.

(3) Dispersal barrier demonstration

(A) In general

The Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Task Force, shall investigate and identify environmentally sound methods for preventing and reducing the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species between the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence drainage and the Mississippi River drainage through the Chicago River Ship and Sanitary Canal, including any of those methods that could be incorporated into the operation or construction of the lock system of the Chicago River Ship and Sanitary Canal.

(B) Report

Not later than 18 months after October 26, 1996 , the Assistant Secretary shall issue a report to the Congress that includes recommendations concerning

(i) which of the methods that are identified under the study conducted under this paragraph are most promising with respect to preventing and reducing the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species; and

(ii) ways to incorporate those methods into ongoing operations of the United States Army Corps of Engineers that are conducted at the Chicago River Ship and Sanitary Canal.

(C) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of the Army such sums as are necessary to carry out the dispersal barrier demonstration project directed by this paragraph.

(4) Contributions

To the extent allowable by law, in carrying out the studies under paragraphs (2) and (3), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of the Army may enter into an agreement with an interested party under which that party provides in kind or monetary contributions for the study.

(5) Technical assistance

The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall provide technical assistance to appropriate entities to assist in the research conducted pursuant to this subsection.
