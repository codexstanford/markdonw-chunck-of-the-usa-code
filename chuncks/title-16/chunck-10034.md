(2) Acquisition authorities

A State, local government, or other non-Federal entity is eligible to receive funds for the acquisition of real property from willing sellers under this chapter if the acquisition ensures

(ii) a scientifically based, direct enhancement to the health of fish and fish populations, as determined by the Board.

(B) State agency approval

(i) In general

All real property interest acquisition projects funded under this chapter must be approved by the State agency in the State in which the project is occurring.

The Board may not recommend, and the Secretary may not provide any funding for, any real property interest acquisition that has not been approved by the State agency.

(C) Assessment of other authorities

The Board may not recommend, and the Secretary may not provide any funding under this chapter for, any real property interest acquisition unless the Partnership that recommended the project has conducted a project assessment, submitted with the funding request and approved by the Board, to demonstrate all other Federal, State, and local authorities for the acquisition of real property have been exhausted.

A real property interest may not be acquired pursuant to a fish habitat conservation project by a State, local government, or other non-Federal entity conducted with funds provided under this chapter, unless
