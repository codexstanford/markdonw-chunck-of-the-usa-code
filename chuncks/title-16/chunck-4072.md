(1) Applicable standards

Within 60 days after November 14, 1997 , the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives on the scientific and legal standards and criteria for threatened, endangered, and candidate species under the Endangered Species Act [ 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] and any other species used to develop the habitat conservation plan (hereinafter “HCP”) and the section 10(a) [ 16 U.S.C. 1539(a) ] incidental take permit for the Pacific Lumber Company land.

(2) Report

If the Pacific Lumber Company submits an application for an incidental take permit under section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act [ 16 U.S.C. 1539(a) ] for the transaction authorized by subsection (a), and the permit is not issued, then the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service shall set forth the substantive rationale or rationales for why the measures proposed by the applicant for such permit did not meet the issuance criteria for the species at issue. Such report shall be submitted to the Congress within 60 days of the decision not to issue such permit or by May 1, 1999 , whichever is earlier.

(3) HCP standards

If a section 10(a) permit for the Pacific Lumber Company HCP is issued, it shall be deemed to be unique to the circumstances associated with the acquisition authorized by this section and shall not establish a higher or lesser standard for any other multispecies HCPs than would otherwise be established under existing law.
