##### (c) Chronic wasting disease transmission in cervidae resource study

(1) Definition of Academy

In this subsection, the term “Academy” means the National Academy of Sciences.

(2) Study

(A) In general

The Secretaries shall enter into an arrangement with the Academy under which the Academy shall conduct, and submit to the Secretaries a report describing the findings of, a special resource study to identify the predominant pathways and mechanisms of the transmission of chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and farmed populations of cervids in the United States.

(B) Requirements

The arrangement under subparagraph (A) shall provide that the actual expenses incurred by the Academy in conducting the study under subparagraph (A) shall be paid by the Secretaries, subject to the availability of appropriations.

(3) Contents of the study

The study under paragraph (2) shall

(A) with respect to wild, captive, and farmed populations of cervids in the United States, identify

(i)

(I) to the extent possible, the pathways and mechanisms for the transmission of chronic wasting disease within live cervid populations and cervid products, which may include pathways and mechanisms for transmission from Canada;

(II) the infection rates for each pathway and mechanism identified under subclause (I); and

(III) the relative frequency of transmission of each pathway and mechanism identified under subclause (I);

(ii)

(I) anthropogenic and environmental factors contributing to new chronic wasting disease emergence events;

(II) the development of geographical areas with increased chronic wasting disease prevalence; and

(III) the overall geographical patterns of chronic wasting disease distribution;

(iii) significant gaps in current scientific knowledge regarding the transmission pathways and mechanisms identified under clause (i)(I) and potential prevention, detection, and control methods identified under clause (v);

(iv) for prioritization the scientific research projects that will address the knowledge gaps identified under clause (iii), based on the likelihood that a project will contribute significantly to the prevention or control of chronic wasting disease; and

(v) potential prevention, detection, or control measures, practices, or technologies to be used to mitigate the transmission and spread of chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and farmed populations of cervids in the United States;

(B) assess the effectiveness of the potential prevention, detection, or control measures, practices, or technologies identified under subparagraph (A)(v); and

(C) review and compare science-based best practices, standards, and guidance regarding the prevention, detection, and management of chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and farmed populations of cervids in the United States that have been developed by

(i) the National Chronic Wasting Disease Herd Certification Program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service;

(ii) the National Wildlife Research Center of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service;

(iii) the United States Geological Survey;

(iv) State wildlife and agricultural agencies, in the case of practices, standards, and guidance that provide practical, science-based recommendations to State and Federal agencies for minimizing or eliminating the risk of transmission of chronic wasting disease in the United States; and

(v) industry or academia, in the case of any published guidance on practices that provide practical, science-based recommendations to cervid producers for minimizing or eliminating the risk of transmission of chronic wasting disease within or between herds.

(4) Deadline

The study under paragraph (2) shall be completed not later than 180 days after the date on which funds are first made available for the study.

(5) Data sharing

The Secretaries shall share with the Academy, as necessary to conduct the study under paragraph (2), subject to the avoidance of a violation of a privacy or confidentiality requirement and the protection of confidential or privileged commercial, financial, or proprietary information, data and access to databases and research information on chronic wasting disease under the jurisdiction of

(A) the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; and

(B) the United States Geological Survey.

(6) Report

Not later than 60 days after the date of completion of the study, the Secretaries shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives a report that describes

(A) the findings of the study; and

(B) any conclusions and recommendations that the Secretaries determine to be appropriate.
