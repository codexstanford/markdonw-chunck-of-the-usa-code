##### (d) Little Cumberland Island; acquisition restrictions

(1) In order to provide an opportunity for the establishment of a natural and scenic preserve by voluntary private action of certain owners of lands within the seashore, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, no lands or interests in lands shall be acquired on Little Cumberland Island without the consent of the owner, for a period of one year from October 23, 1972 , except as specifically otherwise provided herein.

(2) In the event that the owners of land on Little Cumberland Island enter into an irrevocable trust or some other irrevocable agreement for the preservation of the resources of Little Cumberland Island which, in the judgment of the Secretary, assures the protection of the resources in a manner consistent with the purposes for which the seashore is established, the authority of the Secretary to acquire such lands shall be suspended for such time as the trust is in effect and the lands are used and occupied in accordance therewith.

(3) If, at any time during the one-year period following October 23, 1972 , the Secretary determines that any lands on Little Cumberland Island are threatened with development, or other uses, inconsistent with the establishment or continuation of the trust herein referred to, then the Secretary may acquire such lands, or interests therein, by any of the methods provided for in section 459i–1 of this title .
