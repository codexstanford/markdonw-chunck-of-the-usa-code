#### § 2404. Permits
##### (c) Action by appropriate Secretaries on certain permit applications

(1) If the Director receives an application for a permit under this section requesting authority to undertake any action with respect to

(A) any native mammal which is a marine mammal within the meaning of section 1362(5)  1 of this title;

(B) any native mammal, native bird, or native plant which is an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); or

(C) any native bird which is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act ( 16 U.S.C. 701 et seq.); the Director shall submit a copy of the application to the Secretary of Commerce or to the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate (hereinafter in this subsection referred to respectively as the “appropriate Secretary”).

(2) After receiving a copy of any application from the Director under paragraph (1) the appropriate Secretary shall promptly determine, and notify the Director, whether or not any action proposed in the application also requires a permit or other authorization under any law administered by the appropriate Secretary.

(3) If the appropriate Secretary notifies the Director that any action proposed in the application requires a permit or other authorization under any law administered by the appropriate Secretary, the Director may not issue a permit under this section with respect to such action unless such other required permit or authorization is issued by the appropriate Secretary and a copy thereof is submitted to the Director. The issuance of any permit or other authorization by the appropriate Secretary for the carrying out of any action with respect to any native mammal, native bird, or native plant shall not be deemed to entitle the applicant concerned to the issuance by the Director of a permit under this section.
