The Congress finds that

(1) the Weir Farm in Connecticut is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic site associated with major American artists and several artistic developments;

(2) the Weir Farm, acquired in 1882 by J. Alden Weir, a founder and principal exponent of American Impressionism, has been continuously occupied by working artists and their families who have maintained its significance and integrity as a historic site; and

(3) the Weir Farm, including the house, barns, studios, pond, field, and woods thereon, and the approximately 113 acres of adjacent natural areas owned by the Nature Conservancy and the Town of Ridgefield, Connecticut, provide opportunities for illustrating and interpreting cultural themes of our Nation’s heritage and provide opportunities for public use and enjoyment.
