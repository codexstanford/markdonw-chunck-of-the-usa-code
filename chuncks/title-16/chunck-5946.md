#### § 831n–4. Bonds for financing power program
##### (f) Rates for sale of power; application of net proceeds

The Corporation shall charge rates for power which will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system; payments to States and counties in lieu of taxes; debt service on outstanding bonds, including provision and maintenance of reserve funds and other funds established in connection therewith; payments to the Treasury as a return on the appropriation investment pursuant to subsection (e) hereof; payment to the Treasury of the repayment sums specified in subsection (e) hereof; and such additional margin as the Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding bonds in advance of maturity, additional reduction of appropriation investment, and other purposes connected with the Corporation’s power business, having due regard for the primary objectives of the chapter, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. In order to protect the investment of holders of the Corporation’s securities and the appropriation investment as defined in subsection (e) hereof, the Corporation, during each successive five-year period beginning with the five-year period which commences on July 1 of the first full fiscal year after the effective date of this section, shall apply net power proceeds either in reduction (directly or through payments into reserve or sinking funds) of its capital obligations, including bonds and the appropriation investment, or to reinvestment in power assets, at least to the extent of the combined amount of the aggregate of the depreciation accruals and other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures applicable to its power properties plus the net proceeds realized from any disposition of power facilities in said period. As of October 1, 1975 , the five-year periods described herein shall be computed as beginning on October 1 of that year and of each fifth year thereafter.
