#### § 6410. Ruth D. Gates Coral Reef Conservation Grant Program
##### (b) Matching requirements for grants

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (3), Federal funds for any coral reef project for which a grant is provided under subsection (a) may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the project.

(2) Non-Federal share

The non-Federal share of the cost of a coral reef project may be provided by in-kind contributions and other noncash support.

(3) Waiver

The Administrator may waive all or part of the matching requirement under paragraph (1) if the Administrator determines that no reasonable means are available through which an applicant can meet the matching requirement with respect to a coral reef project and the probable benefit of the project outweighs the public interest in the matching requirement.
