#### § 4407. Allocation of amounts available to carry out this chapter
##### (b) Cost sharing

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), as a condition of providing assistance under this chapter for any approved wetlands conservation project, the Secretary shall require that the portion of the costs of the project paid with amounts provided by non-Federal United States sources is equal to at least the amount allocated under subsection (a) that is used for the project.

(2) Federal moneys allocated under subsection (a) may be used to pay 100 percent of the costs of such projects located on Federal lands and waters, including the acquisition of inholdings within such lands and waters.

(3) The non-Federal share of the United States contribution to the costs of such projects may not be derived from Federal grant programs. In the case of a project carried out in Canada or Mexico, the non-Federal share of the costs of the project may include cash contributions from non-United States sources that are used to pay costs of the project. In the case of a project carried out in Canada, funds from Canadian sources may comprise up to 50 percent of the non-Federal share of the costs of the project.
