### CHAPTER 15B— GREAT LAKES FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION
#### § 941. Findings

Congress finds that

(1) the Great Lakes have fish and wildlife communities that are structurally and functionally changing;

(2) successful fish and wildlife management focuses on the lakes as ecosystems, and effective management requires the coordination and integration of efforts of many partners;

(3) additional actions and better coordination are needed to protect and effectively manage the fish and wildlife resources, and the habitats on which the resources depend, in the Great Lakes Basin; and

(4) this chapter allows Federal agencies, States, and Indian tribes to work in an effective partnership by providing the funding for restoration work.
