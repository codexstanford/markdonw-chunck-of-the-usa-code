### CHAPTER 12— FEDERAL REGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF POWER
#### § 824o. Electric reliability
##### (i) Savings provisions

(1) The ERO shall have authority to develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards for only the bulk-power system.

(2) This section does not authorize the ERO or the Commission to order the construction of additional generation or transmission capacity or to set and enforce compliance with standards for adequacy or safety of electric facilities or services.

(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt any authority of any State to take action to ensure the safety, adequacy, and reliability of electric service within that State, as long as such action is not inconsistent with any reliability standard, except that the State of New York may establish rules that result in greater reliability within that State, as long as such action does not result in lesser reliability outside the State than that provided by the reliability standards.

(4) Within 90 days of the application of the Electric Reliability Organization or other affected party, and after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall issue a final order determining whether a State action is inconsistent with a reliability standard, taking into consideration any recommendation of the ERO.

(5) The Commission, after consultation with the ERO and the State taking action, may stay the effectiveness of any State action, pending the Commission’s issuance of a final order.
