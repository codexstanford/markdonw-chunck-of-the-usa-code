#### § 268a. Acquisition of Fern Lake watershed
##### (b) Findings and purposes

(1) Findings

The Congress finds the following:

(A) Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed in Bell County, Kentucky, and Claiborne County, Tennessee, is  1 within the potential boundaries of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park as originally authorized by the Act of June 11, 1940 ( 54 Stat. 262 ; 16 U.S.C. 261 et seq.).

(B) The acquisition of Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed and its inclusion in Cumberland Gap National Historical Park would protect the vista from Pinnacle Overlook, which is one of the park’s most valuable scenic resources and most popular attractions, and enhance recreational opportunities at the park.

(C) Fern Lake is the water supply source for the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, and environs.

(D) The 4,500-acre Fern Lake watershed is privately owned, and the 150-acre lake and part of the watershed are currently for sale, but the Secretary of the Interior is precluded by the first section of the Act of June 11, 1940 ( 16 U.S.C. 261 ), from using appropriated funds to acquire the lands.

(2) Purposes

The purposes of the section are

(A) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to use appropriated funds if necessary, in addition to other acquisition methods, to acquire from willing sellers Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed, in order to protect scenic and natural resources and enhance recreational opportunities at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park; and

(B) to allow the continued supply of water from Fern Lake to the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, and environs.
