### CHAPTER 31— MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION
#### § 1383. Application to other treaties and conventions
##### (a) Generally; findings; waiver of penalties

The provisions of this subchapter shall be deemed to be in addition to and not in contravention of the provisions of any existing international treaty, convention, or agreement, or any statute implementing the same, which may otherwise apply to the taking of marine mammals. Upon a finding by the Secretary that the provisions of any international treaty, convention, or agreement, or any statute implementing the same has been made applicable to persons subject to the provisions of this subchapter in order to effect essential compliance with the regulatory provisions of this chapter so as to reduce to the lowest practicable level the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations, section 1375 of this title may not apply to such persons.
