#### § 6402. Federal coral reef management and restoration activities
##### (b) Activities described

Activities described in this subsection are activities to conserve, research, monitor, assess, and restore coral reefs and coral reef ecosystems in waters managed under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency specified in subsection (c) or in coordination with a State in waters managed under the jurisdiction of such State, including

(1) developing, including through the collection of requisite in situ and remotely sensed data, high-quality and digitized maps reflecting

(A) current and historical live coral cover data;

(B) coral reef habitat quality data;

(C) priority areas for coral reef conservation to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function, including the reef matrix, that benefit coastal communities and living marine resources;

(D) priority areas for coral reef restoration to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function, including the reef matrix, to benefit coastal communities and living marine resources; and

(E) areas of concern that may require enhanced monitoring of coral health and cover;

(2) enhancing compliance with Federal laws that prohibit or regulate

(A) the taking of coral products or species associated with coral reefs; or

(B) the use and management of coral reef ecosystems;

(3) long-term ecological monitoring of coral reef ecosystems;

(4) implementing species-specific recovery plans for listed coral species consistent with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);

(5) restoring degraded coral reef ecosystems;

(6) reducing land-based stressors to coral reef ecosystems;

(7) promoting ecologically sound navigation and anchorages, including through navigational aids and expansion of reef-safe anchorages and mooring buoy systems, to enhance recreational access while preventing or minimizing the likelihood of vessel impacts or other physical damage to coral reefs;

(8) monitoring and responding to severe bleaching or mortality events, disease outbreaks, invasive species outbreaks, and significant maritime accidents, including hazardous spill cleanup and the removal of grounded vessels;

(9) conducting scientific research that contributes to the understanding, sustainable use, and long-term conservation of coral reefs;

(10) enhancing public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of coral reefs and coral reef ecosystems and their ecological and socioeconomic value; and

(11) centrally archiving, managing, and distributing on a public website data sets and coral reef ecosystem assessments, including the data repositories of the Coral Reef Conservation Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
