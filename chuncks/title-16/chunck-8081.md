Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary in consultation with the State shall establish

(1) at least six Alaska subsistence resource regions which, taken together, include all public lands. The number and boundaries of the regions shall be sufficient to assure that regional differences in subsistence uses are adequately accommodated;

(3) a regional advisory council in each subsistence resource region. Each regional advisory council shall be composed of residents of the region and shall have the following authority:

(A) the review and evaluation of proposals for regulations, policies, management plans, and other matters relating to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within the region;

(B) the provision of a forum for the expression of opinions and recommendations by persons interested in any matter related to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within the region;

(C) the encouragement of local and regional participation pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in the decisionmaking process affecting the taking of fish and wildlife on the public lands within the region for subsistence uses;

(D) the preparation of an annual report to the Secretary which shall contain

(i) an identification of current and anticipated subsistence uses of fish and wildlife populations within the region;

(ii) an evaluation of current and anticipated subsistence needs for fish and wildlife populations within the region;

(iii) a recommended strategy for the management of fish and wildlife populations within the region to accommodate such subsistence uses and needs; and

(iv) recommendations concerning policies, standards, guidelines, and regulations to implement the strategy. The State fish and game advisory committees or such local advisory committees as the Secretary may establish pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection may provide advice to, and assist, the regional advisory councils in carrying out the functions set forth in this paragraph.
