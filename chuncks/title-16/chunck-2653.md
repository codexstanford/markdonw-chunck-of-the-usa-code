#### § 460u–5. Owner’s retention of right of use and occupancy for residential purposes
##### (c) Extension of use and occupancy rights

With respect to improved properties acquired prior to December 28, 1980 , and upon which a valid existing right of use and occupancy has been reserved for a term of not more than twenty years, the Secretary may, in his discretion, extend the term of such retained right for a period of not more than nine years upon receipt of payment prior to September 30, 1983 , from the holder of the retained right. The amount of such payment shall be equivalent to the amount discounted from the purchase price paid by the Secretary for the identical period of time under the terms of the original sale adjusted by a general index adopted by the Secretary reflecting overall value trends within Indiana Dunes National Park between the time of the original sale and the time of the retained right of extension offered by this subsection.
