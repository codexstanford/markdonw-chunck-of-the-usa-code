### CHAPTER 84— HEALTHY FOREST RESTORATION
#### § 6512. Authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects
##### (f) Large tree retention

(1) In general

Except in old growth stands where the management direction is consistent with subsection (e)(2), the Secretary shall carry out a covered project in a manner that

(A) focuses largely on small diameter trees, thinning, strategic fuel breaks, and prescribed fire to modify fire behavior, as measured by the projected reduction of uncharacteristically severe wildfire effects for the forest type (such as adverse soil impacts, tree mortality or other impacts); and

(B) maximizes the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fire-resilient stands.

(2) Wildfire risk

Nothing in this subsection prevents achievement of the purposes described in section 6501(1) of this title .
