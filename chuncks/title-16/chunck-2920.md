#### § 460ff–1. Acquisition of land
##### (d) Acquired lands partly outside boundaries; exchange for non-Federal lands within boundaries; report to General Services Administration for disposal

When any tract of land is only partly within the boundaries of the park, the Secretary may acquire all or any portion of the land outside of such boundaries in order to minimize the payment of severance costs. Land so acquired outside of the boundaries may be exchanged by the Secretary for non-Federal lands within the boundaries. Any portion of the land acquired outside the boundaries and not utilized for exchange shall be reported to the General Services Administration for disposal under chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41: Provided , That no disposal shall be for less than the fair market value of the lands involved.
