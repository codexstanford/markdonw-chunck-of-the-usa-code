### CHAPTER 31— MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION
#### § 1362. Definitions
####### (B) In the case of a military readiness activity (as defined in section 315(f) of Public Law 107–314 ; 16 U.S.C. 703 note) or a scientific research activity conducted by or on behalf of the Federal Government consistent with section 1374(c)(3) of this title , the term “harassment” means

(i) any act that injures or has the significant potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild; or

(ii) any act that disturbs or is likely to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of natural behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, surfacing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering, to a point where such behavioral patterns are abandoned or significantly altered.

(C) The term “Level A harassment” means harassment described in subparagraph (A)(i) or, in the case of a military readiness activity or scientific research activity described in subparagraph (B), harassment described in subparagraph (B)(i).

(D) The term “Level B harassment” means harassment described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or, in the case of a military readiness activity or scientific research activity described in subparagraph (B), harassment described in subparagraph (B)(ii).

(19) The term “strategic stock” means a marine mammal stock

(A) for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the potential biological removal level;

(B) which, based on the best available scientific information, is declining and is likely to be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [ 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] within the foreseeable future; or

(C) which is listed as a threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), or is designated as depleted under this chapter.

(20) The term “potential biological removal level” means the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. The potential biological removal level is the product of the following factors:

(A) The minimum population estimate of the stock.

(B) One-half the maximum theoretical or estimated net productivity rate of the stock at a small population size.

(C) A recovery factor of between 0.1 and 1.0.

(21) The term “Regional Fishery Management Council” means a Regional Fishery Management Council established under section 1852 of this title .

(22) The term “bona fide research” means scientific research on marine mammals, the results of which

(A) likely would be accepted for publication in a referred scientific journal;

(B) are likely to contribute to the basic knowledge of marine mammal biology or ecology; or

(C) are likely to identify, evaluate, or resolve conservation problems.

(23) The term “Alaska Native organization” means a group designated by law or formally chartered which represents or consists of Indians, Aleuts, or Eskimos residing in Alaska.

(24) The term “take reduction plan” means a plan developed under section 1387 of this title .

(25) The term “take reduction team” means a team established under section 1387 of this title .

(26) The term “net productivity rate” means the annual per capita rate of increase in a stock resulting from additions due to reproduction, less losses due to mortality.

(27) The term “minimum population estimate” means an estimate of the number of animals in a stock that

(A) is based on the best available scientific information on abundance, incorporating the precision and variability associated with such information; and

(B) provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate.

(28) The term “International Dolphin Conservation Program” means the international program established by the agreement signed in LaJolla, California, in June, 1992, as formalized, modified, and enhanced in accordance with the Declaration of Panama.

(29) The term “Declaration of Panama” means the declaration signed in Panama City, Republic of Panama, on October 4, 1995 .
