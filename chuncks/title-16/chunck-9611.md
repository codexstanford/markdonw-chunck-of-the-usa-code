#### § 6592a. Ecosystem restoration
##### (d) Wood products infrastructure

The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior, shall

(1) develop a ranking system that categorizes units of Federal land, including Indian forest land or rangeland, with regard to treating areas at risk of unnaturally severe wildfire or insect or disease infestation, as being

(A) very low priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal;

(B) low priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal;

(C) medium priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal;

(D) high priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal; or

(E) very high priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal;

(2) determine, for a unit identified under paragraph (1) as being high or very high priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal, if

(A) a sawmill or other wood-processing facility exists in close proximity to, or a forest worker is seeking to conduct restoration treatment work on or in close proximity to, the unit; and

(B) the presence of a sawmill or other wood-processing facility would substantially decrease or does substantially decrease the cost of conducting ecological restoration projects involving vegetation removal;

(3) in accordance with any conditions the Secretary of Agriculture determines to be necessary, using the amounts made available under subsection (b)(3), provide financial assistance, including a low-interest loan or a loan guarantee, to an entity seeking to establish, reopen, retrofit, expand, or improve a sawmill or other wood-processing facility in close proximity to a unit of Federal land that has been identified under paragraph (1) as high or very high priority for ecological restoration, if the presence of a sawmill or other wood-processing facility would substantially decrease or does substantially decrease the cost of conducting ecological restoration projects involving vegetation removal on the unit of Federal land, including Indian forest land or rangeland, as determined under paragraph (2)(B); and

(4) to the extent practicable, when allocating funding to units of Federal land for ecological restoration projects involving vegetation removal, give priority to a unit of Federal land that

(A) has been identified under paragraph (1) as being high or very high priority for ecological restoration involving vegetation removal; and

(B) has a sawmill or other wood-processing facility

(i) that, as determined under paragraph (2)

(I) exists in close proximity to the unit; and

(II) does substantially decrease the cost of conducting ecological restoration projects involving vegetation removal on the unit; or

(ii) that has received financial assistance under paragraph (3).
