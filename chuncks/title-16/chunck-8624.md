(1) Definitions

In this subsection:

(A) Eligible entity

The term “eligible entity” means, as determined by the Secretary

(i) a third-party private entity the primary business of which is related to agriculture;

(ii) a nongovernmental organization with experience working with agricultural producers; or

(iii) a governmental organization.

The term “new or innovative conservation approach” means

(i) new or innovative

(I) precision agriculture technologies;

(II) enhanced nutrient management plans, nutrient recovery systems, and fertilization systems;

(III) soil health management systems, including systems to increase soil carbon levels;

(IV) water management systems;

(V) resource-conserving crop rotations (as defined in section 3839aa–24(d)(1) of this title );

(VI) cover crops; and

(VII) irrigation systems; and

(ii) any other conservation approach approved by the Secretary as new or innovative.

(2) Testing new or innovative conservation approaches

Using $25,000,000 of the funds made available to carry out this subpart for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2031, the Secretary shall carry out on-farm conservation innovation trials, on eligible land of producers, to test new or innovative conservation approaches

(A) directly with producers; or

(B) through eligible entities.

(3) Incentive payments

(A) Agreements

In carrying out paragraph (2), the Secretary shall enter into agreements with producers (either directly or through eligible entities) on whose land an on-farm conservation innovation trial is being carried out to provide payments (including payments to compensate for foregone income, as appropriate to address the increased economic risk potentially associated with new or innovative conservation approaches) to the producers to assist with adopting and evaluating new or innovative conservation approaches to achieve conservation benefits.

(B) Adjusted gross income requirements

(II) adequate data collection and analysis by a producer or eligible entity to report the natural resource and agricultural production benefits of the new or innovative conservation approaches to the Secretary.

(4) Flexible adoption

The scale of adoption of a new or innovative conservation approach under an on-farm conservation innovation trial under an agreement under paragraph (2) may include multiple scales on an operation, including whole farm, field-level, or sub-field scales.

(5) Technical assistance

The Secretary shall provide technical assistance

(A) to each producer or eligible entity participating in an on-farm conservation innovation trial under paragraph (2) with respect to the design, installation, and management of the new or innovative conservation approaches; and

(B) to each eligible entity participating in an on-farm conservation innovation trial under paragraph (2) with respect to data analyses of the on-farm conservation innovation trial.

(6) Geographic scope

The Secretary shall identify a diversity of geographic regions of the United States in which to establish on-farm conservation innovation trials under paragraph (2), taking into account factors such as soil type, cropping history, and water availability.

(7) Soil health demonstration trial

Using funds made available to carry out this subsection, the Secretary shall carry out a soil health demonstration trial under which the Secretary coordinates with eligible entities

(A) to provide incentives to producers to implement conservation practices that

(i) improve soil health;

(ii) increase carbon levels in the soil; or

(iii) meet the goals described in clauses (i) and (ii);

(B) to establish protocols for measuring carbon levels in the soil and testing carbon levels on land where conservation practices described in subparagraph (A) were applied to evaluate gains in soil health as a result of the practices implemented by the producers in the soil health demonstration trial; and

(C)

(i) not later than September 30, 2020 , to initiate a study regarding changes in soil health and, if feasible, economic outcomes, generated as a result of the conservation practices described in subparagraph (A) that were applied by producers through the soil health demonstration trial; and

(ii) to submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate annual reports on the progress and results of the study under clause (i).
