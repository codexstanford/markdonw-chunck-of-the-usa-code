M. Gomez Grant; thence easterly along the northern boundary of H. M. Gomez Grant and continuing easterly in a straight line to a point of intersection with the line between the marsh and the dunes; thence southerly along the line between the marsh and the dunes to a point approximately one-half mile north of the southern boundary of the seashore created in section 1; thence westerly in a straight line to connect with and to follow the Government Railroad to its intersection with State Highway 3; thence southerly along State Highway 3 to the point of beginning. The portion of land bounded by the northern boundary of the H. M. Gomez Grant is hereby transferred to the Secretary of the Interior and may be used for the purpose of establishing such facilities as are needed for the administration of the seashore, for the construction of the principal visitor center which shall be designated as the “Spessard L.

In administering the shoreline and adjacent lands the Secretary shall retain such lands in their natural and primitive condition, shall prohibit vehicular traffic on the beach except for administrative purposes, and shall develop only those facilities which he deems essential for public health and safety.

(2) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall administer the remaining lands described in section 459j of this title .
