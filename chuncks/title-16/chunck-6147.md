### CHAPTER 12H— PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
#### § 839e. Rates
##### (l) Rates for sales outside United States; negotiations

In order to further the purposes of this chapter and to protect the consumers of the region, the Administrator may negotiate, or establish, rates for electric power sold by the Administrator to any entity not located in the United States which shall be equitable in relation to rates for all electric power which is, or may be, purchased by the Administrator or the Administrator’s customers from entities outside the United States. In establishing rates other than by negotiation, the provisions of subsection (i) shall apply. In the case of any negotiation with an entity not located in the United States, the Administrator shall provide public notice of any proposal to negotiate such rates. Such negotiated rates shall be not less than the rates established under this chapter for nonfirm power sold within the United States but outside the region. The Administrator shall also afford notice of any rates negotiated pursuant to this subsection.
