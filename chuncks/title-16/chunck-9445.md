### CHAPTER 83— CORAL REEF CONSERVATION
#### § 6410. Ruth D. Gates Coral Reef Conservation Grant Program
##### (f) Criteria for approval

The Administrator may not approve a proposal for a coral reef project under this section unless the project

(1) is consistent with

(A) the National Coral Reef Resilience Strategy; and

(B) any Federal or non-Federal coral reef action plans in effect under section 6404 of this title covering a coral reef or ecologically significant unit of a coral reef to be affected by the project; and

(2) will enhance the conservation and restoration of coral reefs by

(A) addressing conflicts arising from the use of environments near coral reefs or from the use of corals, species associated with coral reefs, and coral products, including supporting consensus-driven and community-based planning and management initiatives for the protection of coral reef ecosystems;

(B) improving compliance with laws that prohibit or regulate the taking of coral products or species associated with coral reefs or regulate the use and management of coral reef ecosystems;

(C) designing and implementing networks of real-time water quality monitoring along coral reefs, including data collection related to turbidity, nutrient availability, harmful algal blooms, and plankton assemblages, with an emphasis on coral reefs impacted by agriculture and urban development;

(D) promoting ecologically sound navigation and anchorages, including mooring buoy systems to promote enhanced recreational access, near coral reefs;

(E) furthering the goals and objectives of coral reef action plans in effect under section 6404 of this title ;

(F) mapping the location and distribution of coral reefs and potential coral reef habitat;

(G) stimulating innovation to advance the ability of the United States to understand, research, or monitor coral reef ecosystems, or to develop management or adaptation options to conserve and restore coral reef ecosystems;

(H) implementing research to ensure the population viability of coral species in United States waters listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [ 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] as detailed in the population-based recovery criteria included in species-specific recovery plans established under such Act;

(I) developing and implementing cost-effective methods to restore degraded coral reef ecosystems or to create geographically appropriate coral reef ecosystems in suitable waters, including by improving habitat or promoting success of keystone species, with an emphasis on novel restoration strategies and techniques to advance coral reef recovery and growth near population centers threatened by rising sea levels and storm surge;

(J) translating and applying coral genetics research to coral reef ecosystem restoration, including research related to traits that promote resilience to increasing ocean temperatures, changing ocean chemistry, coral bleaching, coral diseases, and invasive species;

(K) developing and maintaining in situ native coral propagation sites; or

(L) developing and maintaining ex situ coral propagation nurseries and land-based coral gene banks to

(i) conserve or augment genetic diversity of native coral populations;

(ii) support captive breeding of rare coral species; or

(iii) enhance resilience of native coral populations to increasing ocean temperatures, changing ocean chemistry, coral bleaching, and coral diseases through selective breeding, conditioning, or other approaches that target genes, gene expression, phenotypic traits, or phenotypic plasticity.
