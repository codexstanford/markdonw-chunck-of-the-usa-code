#### § 410ii–3. Acquisition of properties
##### (d) Exchange of Federal property; pool, acreage designation

(1) For purposes of completing an exchange pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary shall designate a pool of at least three times the private acreage described in subsections (a) and (b), comprised of Federal property interests of a similar resource character to property to be exchanged. Federal property shall, whenever possible, be designated in blocks of at least one section in size, but in no event shall the blocks designated be less than one-quarter of a section in size.

(2) The Secretary may include within the pool any Federal property under his jurisdiction except units of the National Park System, National Forest System, or the National Wildlife Refuge System that are nominated by the owner of the private property to be exchanged. Exchanges shall be on the basis of equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash in order to equalize the value of the property exchange, except that if the parties agree to an exchange and the Secretary determines it is in the public interest, such exchange may be made for other than equal values.
