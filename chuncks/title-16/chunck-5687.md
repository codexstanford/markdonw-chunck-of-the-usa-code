#### § 824a–3. Cogeneration and small power production
##### (j) New dams and diversions

Except for a hydroelectric project located at a Government dam (as defined in section 3(10) of the Federal Power Act [ 16 U.S.C. 796(10) ]) at which non-Federal hydroelectric development is permissible, this section shall not apply to any hydroelectric project which impounds or diverts the water of a natural watercourse by means of a new dam or diversion unless the project meets each of the following requirements:

(1) No substantial adverse effects

At the time of issuance of the license or exemption for the project, the Commission finds that the project will not have substantial adverse effects on the environment, including recreation and water quality. Such finding shall be made by the Commission after taking into consideration terms and conditions imposed under either paragraph (3) of this subsection or section 10 of the Federal Power Act [ 16 U.S.C. 803 ] (whichever is appropriate as required by that Act [ 16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.] or the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986) and compliance with other environmental requirements applicable to the project.

(2) Protected rivers

At the time the application for a license or exemption for the project is accepted by the Commission (in accordance with the Commission’s regulations and procedures in effect on January 1, 1986 , including those relating to environmental consultation), such project is not located on either of the following:

(A) Any segment of a natural watercourse which is included in (or designated for potential inclusion in) a State or national wild and scenic river system.

(B) Any segment of a natural watercourse which the State has determined, in accordance with applicable State law, to possess unique natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes which would be adversely affected by hydroelectric development.

(3) Fish and wildlife terms and conditions

The project meets the terms and conditions set by fish and wildlife agencies under the same procedures as provided for under section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act [ 16 U.S.C. 823a(c) ].
