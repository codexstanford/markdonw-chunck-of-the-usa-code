### CHAPTER 12H— PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
#### § 839d. Conservation and resource acquisition
##### (c) Procedure for acquiring major resources, implementing conservation measures, paying or reimbursing investigation and preconstruction expenses, or granting billing credits

(1) For each proposal under subsection (a), (b), (f), (h), or ( l ) of this section to acquire a major resource, to implement a conservation measure which will conserve an amount of electric power equivalent to that of a major resource, to pay or reimburse investigation and preconstruction expenses of the sponsors of a major resource, or to grant billing credits or services involving a major resource, the Administrator shall

(A) publish notice of the proposed action in the Federal Register and provide a copy of such notice to the Council, the Governor of each State in which facilities would be constructed or a conservation measure implemented, and the Administrator’s customers;

(B) not less than sixty days following publication of such notice, conduct one or more public hearings, presided over by a hearing officer, at which testimony and evidence shall be received, with opportunity for such rebuttal and cross-examination as the hearing officer deems appropriate in the development of an adequate hearing record;

(C) develop a record to assist in evaluating the proposal which shall include the transcript of the public hearings, together with exhibits, and such other materials and information as may have been submitted to, or developed by, the Administrator; and

(D) following completion of such hearings, promptly provide to the Council and make public a written decision that includes, in addition to a determination respecting the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (f), (h), ( l ), or (m) of this section, as appropriate

(i) if a plan is in effect, a finding that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the plan or, notwithstanding its inconsistency with the plan, a finding that it is needed to meet the Administrator’s obligations under this chapter, or

(ii) if no plan is in effect, a finding that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title or notwithstanding its inconsistency, a finding that it is needed to meet the Administrator’s obligations under this chapter. In the case of subsection (f) of this section, such decision shall be treated as satisfying the applicable requirements of this subsection and of subsection (f) of this section, if it includes a finding of probable consistency, based upon the Administrator’s evaluation of information available at the time of completion of the hearing under this paragraph. Such decision shall include the reasons for such finding.

(2) Within sixty days of the receipt of the Administrator’s decision pursuant to paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection, the Council may determine by a majority vote of all members of the Council, and notify the Administrator

(A) that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the plan, or

(B) if no plan is in effect, that the proposal is either consistent or inconsistent with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title .

(3) The Administrator may not implement any proposal referred to in paragraph (1) that is determined pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) by either the Administrator or the Council to be inconsistent with the plan or, if no plan is in effect, with the criteria of section 839b(e)(1) of this title and the considerations of section 839b(e)(2) of this title

(A) unless the Administrator finds that, notwithstanding such inconsistency, such resource is needed to meet the Administrator’s obligations under this chapter, and

(B) until the expenditure of funds for that purpose has been specifically authorized by Act of Congress enacted after December 5, 1980 .

(4) Before the Administrator implements any proposal referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator shall

(A) submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress the administrative record of the decision (including any determination by the Council under paragraph (2)) and a statement of the procedures followed or to be followed for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [ 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.],

(B) publish notice of the decision in the Federal Register, and

(C) note the proposal in the Administrator’s annual or supplementary budget submittal made pursuant to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act ( 16 U.S.C. 838 and following). The Administrator may not implement any such proposal until ninety days after the date on which such proposal has been noted in such budget or after the date on which such decision has been published in the Federal Register, whichever is later.

(5) The authority of the Council to make a determination under paragraph (2)(B) if no plan is in effect shall expire on the date two years after the establishment of the Council.
