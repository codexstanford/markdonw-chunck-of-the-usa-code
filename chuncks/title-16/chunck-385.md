The Secretary shall be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of conservation measures for these lands, including, without limitation, protection from fire, disease, insects, or trespass and reasonable prevention or elimination of erosion, damaging land use, overgrazing, or pollution. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to contract with the Secretary of Agriculture for any services or materials deemed necessary to institute or carry out any such measures.

For these purposes, and for the purpose of managing and preserving the resources of the Grand Canyon National Park, the Secretary shall have the right of access to any lands hereby included in the Havasupai Reservation. Nothing in sections 228a to 228j of this title shall be construed to prohibit access by any members of the tribe to any sacred or religious places or burial grounds, native foods, paints, materials, and medicines located on public lands not otherwise covered in sections 228a to 228j of this title.
