##### (e) Allocation of allowable level
######## (D) After the initial release of fishery allocations under subparagraph (C) to a foreign nation, any subsequent release of an allocation for any fishery to such nation shall only be made

(i) after the lapse of such period of time as may be sufficient for purposes of making the determination required under clause (ii); and
