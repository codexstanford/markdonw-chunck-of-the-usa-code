#### § 839e. Rates
##### (d) Discount rates; special rates

(1) In order to avoid adverse impacts on retail rates of the Administrator’s customers with low system densities, the Administrator shall, to the extent appropriate, apply discounts to the rate or rates for such customers.

(2) In order to avoid adverse impacts of increased rates pursuant to this chapter on any direct service industrial customer using raw minerals indigenous to the region as its primary resource, the Administrator, upon request of such customer showing such impacts and after considering the effect of such request on his other obligations under this chapter, is authorized, if the Administrator determines that such impacts will be significant, to establish a special rate applicable to such customer if all power sold to such customer may be interrupted, curtailed, or withdrawn to meet firm loads in the region. Such rate shall be established in accordance with this section and shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
