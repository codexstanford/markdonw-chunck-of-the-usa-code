##### (i) Rights-of-way of city of Los Angeles

(1) The Act entitled “An Act authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Interior to sell to the city of Los Angeles, California, certain public lands in California; and granting rights-of-way over public lands and reserved lands to the city of Los Angeles in Mono County in the State of California”, approved June 23, 1936 ( 49 Stat. 1892 ), is hereby repealed.

(2) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall grant and convey rights-of-way easements, at no cost, to the city of Los Angeles for those rights-of-way on public lands and national forest lands in Mono County, California, as described and set forth in maps and accompanying descriptions which were

(A) filed by the city of Los Angeles with the Secretary of the Interior on October 24, 1944 , and

(B) accepted as proof of construction on behalf of the United States by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on January 4, 1945 . Such easement conveyances shall provide for the right of the city to continue its present operations and to maintain, reconstruct, and replace all existing water and power facilities located within the bounds of the area described in the maps and descriptions referred to in the preceding sentence. The United States shall reserve in the conveyance easements all rights to use and permit the use by others of the lands so conveyed to the extent that such use does not unreasonably interfere with the rights granted herein to the city of Los Angeles.

(3) The grant in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall become effective upon relinquishment in writing by the city of Los Angeles of its applications dated October 20, 1944 , and January 17, 1945 , to purchase twenty-three thousand eight hundred and fifty acres of Federal land.

(4) The easements granted under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall provide that whenever the city of Los Angeles ceases to use the land or any part thereof subject to such easements for the purposes for which it is currently being used, as of September 28, 1984 , all interests in such land or part thereof shall revert to the United States.
