(A) Revocation of orders

Any public land order that withdraws the Federal land from appropriation or disposal under a public land law shall be revoked to the extent necessary to permit disposal of the land.

(B) Withdrawal

On December 19, 2014 , if the Federal land or any Federal interest in the non-Federal land to be exchanged under subsection (c) is not withdrawn or segregated from entry and appropriation under a public land law (including mining and mineral leasing laws and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 ( 30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.)), the land or interest shall be withdrawn, without further action required by the Secretary concerned, from entry and appropriation. The withdrawal shall be terminated

(i) on the date of consummation of the land exchange; or

(ii) if Resolution Copper notifies the Secretary in writing that it has elected to withdraw from the land exchange pursuant to section 206(d) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended ( 43 U.S.C. 1716(d) ).

(C) Rights of Resolution Copper

Nothing in this section shall interfere with, limit, or otherwise impair, the unpatented mining claims or rights currently held by Resolution Copper on the Federal land, nor in any way change, diminish, qualify, or otherwise impact Resolution Copper’s rights and ability to conduct activities on the Federal land under such unpatented mining claims and the general mining laws of the United States, including the permitting or authorization of such activities.

(2) Maps, estimates, and descriptions

(A) Minor errors

The Secretary concerned and Resolution Copper may correct, by mutual agreement, any minor errors in any map, acreage estimate, or description of any land conveyed or exchanged under this section.

(B) Conflict

If there is a conflict between a map, an acreage estimate, or a description of land in this section, the map shall control unless the Secretary concerned and Resolution Copper mutually agree otherwise.

(C) Availability

On December 19, 2014 , the Secretary shall file and make available for public inspection in the Office of the Supervisor, Tonto National Forest, each map referred to in this section.

(3) Public access in and around Oak Flat Campground

As a condition of conveyance of the Federal land, Resolution Copper shall agree to provide access to the surface of the Oak Flat Campground to members of the public, including Indian tribes, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with health and safety requirements, until such time as the operation of the mine precludes continued public access for safety reasons, as determined by Resolution Copper.
