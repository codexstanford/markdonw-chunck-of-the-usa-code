##### (d) Bycatch reduction program

Not later than 12 months after October 11, 1996 , the Secretary shall, in cooperation with affected interests, and based upon the best scientific information available, complete a program to

(1) develop technological devices and other changes in fishing operations necessary and appropriate to minimize the incidental mortality of bycatch in the course of shrimp trawl activity to the extent practicable, taking into account the level of bycatch mortality in the fishery on November 28, 1990 ;

(2) evaluate the ecological impacts and the benefits and costs of such devices and changes in fishing operations; and

(3) assess whether it is practicable to utilize bycatch which is not avoidable.
