(1) Certification

The Secretary shall establish a procedure, consistent with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, for determining if a nation identified under subsection (a) and listed in the report under section 1826h of this title has taken appropriate corrective action with respect to the offending activities identified in the report under section 1826h of this title . The certification procedure shall provide for notice and an opportunity for comment by any such nation. The Secretary shall determine, on the basis of the procedure, and certify to the Congress no later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary promulgates a final rule containing the procedure, and biennially thereafter in the report under section 1826h of this title

(A) whether the government of each nation identified under subsection (a) has provided documentary evidence that it has taken corrective action with respect to the offending activities identified in the report; or

(B) whether the relevant international fishery management organization has implemented measures that are effective in ending the illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activity by vessels of that nation.

(2) Alternative procedure

The Secretary may establish a procedure to authorize, on a shipment-by-shipment, shipper-by-shipper, or other basis the importation of fish or fish products from a vessel of a nation issued a negative certification under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that

(A) the vessel has not engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing under an international fishery management agreement to which the United States is a party; or

(B) the vessel is not identified by an international fishery management organization as participating in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activities.

(3) Effect of certification determination

(A) Effect of negative certification

The provisions of subsection (a) and paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b) of section 1826a of this title shall apply to any nation that, after being identified and notified under subsection (b) has failed to take the appropriate corrective actions for which the Secretary has issued a negative certification under this subsection.

(B) Effect of positive certification

The provisions of subsection (a) and paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b) of section 1826a of this title shall not apply to any nation identified under subsection (a) for which the Secretary has issued a positive certification under this subsection.
