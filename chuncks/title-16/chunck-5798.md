### CHAPTER 12— FEDERAL REGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF POWER
#### § 824q. Native load service obligation
##### (f) Contracts

Nothing in this section shall provide a basis for abrogating any contract or service agreement for firm transmission service or rights in effect as of August 8, 2005 . If an ISO in the Western Interconnection had allocated financial transmission rights prior to August 8, 2005 , but had not done so with respect to one or more load-serving entities’ firm transmission rights held under contracts to which the preceding sentence applies (or held by reason of ownership or future ownership of transmission facilities), such load-serving entities may not be required, without their consent, to convert such firm transmission rights to tradable or financial rights, except where the load-serving entity has voluntarily joined the ISO as a participating transmission owner (or its successor) in accordance with the ISO tariff.
