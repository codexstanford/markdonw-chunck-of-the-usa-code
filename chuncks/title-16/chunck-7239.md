### CHAPTER 36— FOREST AND RANGELAND RENEWABLE RESOURCES PLANNING
#### § 1601. Renewable Resource Assessment
##### (e) Congressional policy of multiple use sustained yield management; examination and certification of lands; estimate of appropriations necessary for reforestation and other treatment; budget requirements; authorization of appropriations

(1) It is the policy of the Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System shall be maintained in appropriate forest cover with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth, and conditions of stand designed to secure the maximum benefits of multiple use sustained yield management in accordance with land management plans. Accordingly, the Secretary is directed to identify and report to the Congress annually at the time of submission of the President’s budget together with the annual report provided for under section 1606(c) of this title , beginning with submission of the President’s budget for fiscal year 1978, the amount and location by forests and States and by productivity class, where practicable, of all lands in the National Forest System where objectives of land management plans indicate the need to reforest areas that have been cut-over or otherwise denuded or deforested, and all lands with stands of trees that are not growing at their best potential rate of growth. All national forest lands treated from year to year shall be examined after the first and third growing seasons and certified by the Secretary in the report provided for under this subsection as to stocking rate, growth rate in relation to potential and other pertinent measures. Any lands not certified as satisfactory shall be returned to the backlog and scheduled for prompt treatment. The level and types of treatment shall be those which secure the most effective mix of multiple use benefits.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1607 of this title , the Secretary shall, annually during each of the 10 years beginning after November 15, 2021 , transmit to the Congress in the manner provided in this subsection an estimate of the sums necessary to be appropriated, in addition to the funds available from other sources, to replant and otherwise treat an acreage equal to the acreage to be cut over that year, plus a sufficient portion of the backlog of lands found to be in need of treatment to eliminate the backlog within the 10-year period. After the 10-year period, the Secretary shall transmit annually to the Congress an estimate of the sums necessary to replant and otherwise treat all lands being cut over and maintain planned timber production on all other forested lands in the National Forest System so as to prevent the development of a backlog of needed work larger than the needed work at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Secretary’s estimate of sums necessary, in addition to the sums available under other authorities, for accomplishment of the reforestation and other treatment of National Forest System lands under this section shall be provided annually for inclusion in the President’s budget and shall also be transmitted to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate together with the annual report provided for under section 1606(c) of this title at the time of submission of the President’s budget to the Congress beginning with the budget for fiscal year 2021. The sums estimated as necessary for reforestation and other treatment shall include moneys needed to secure seed, grow seedlings, prepare sites, plant trees, thin, remove deleterious growth and underbrush, build fence to exclude livestock and adverse wildlife from regeneration areas and otherwise establish and improve growing forests to secure planned production of trees and other multiple use values.

(3) Effective for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1977 , and each fiscal year thereafter, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated for the purpose of reforesting and treating lands in the National Forest System $200,000,000 annually to meet requirements of this subsection. All sums appropriated for the purposes of this subsection shall be available until expended.

(4) Reforestation requirements.

(A) Definitions .

In this paragraph:

(i) Natural regeneration.

(I) In general .

The term “natural regeneration” means the establishment of a tree or tree age class from natural seeding, sprouting, or suckering in accordance with the management objectives of an applicable land management plan.

(II) Inclusion .

The term “natural regeneration” may include any site preparation activity to enhance the success of regeneration to the desired species composition and structure.

(ii) Priority land .

The term “priority land” means National Forest System land that, due to an unplanned event

(I) does not meet the conditions for appropriate forest cover described in paragraph (1);

(II) requires reforestation to meet the objectives of an applicable land management plan; and

(III) is unlikely to experience natural regeneration without assistance.

(iii) Reforestation .

The term “reforestation” means the act of renewing tree cover, taking into consideration species composition and resilience, by establishing young trees through

(I) natural regeneration;

(II) natural regeneration with site preparation; or

(III) planting or direct seeding.

(iv) Secretary .

The term “Secretary” means the Secretary, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service.

(v) Unplanned event.

(I) In general .

The term “unplanned event” means any unplanned disturbance that

(aa) disrupts ecosystem or forest structure or composition; or

(bb) changes resources, substrate availability, or the physical environment.

(II) Inclusions .

The term “unplanned event” may include

(aa) a wildfire;

(bb) an infestation of insects or disease;

(cc) a weather event; and

(dd) animal damage.

(B) Requirement .

Each reforestation activity under this section shall be carried out in accordance with applicable Forest Service management practices and definitions, including definitions relating to silvicultural practices and forest management.

(C) Reforestation priority.

(i) In general .

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to projects on the priority list described in clause (ii).

(ii) Priority list.

(I) In general .

The Secretary shall, based on recommendations from regional foresters, create a priority list of reforestation projects that

(aa) primarily take place on priority land;

(bb) promote effective reforestation following unplanned events; and

(cc) may include activities to ensure adequate and appropriate seed availability.

(II) Ranking .

The Secretary shall rank projects on the priority list under subclause (I) based on

(aa) documentation of an effective reforestation project plan;

(bb) the ability to measure the progress and success of the project; and

(cc) the ability of a project to provide benefits relating to forest function and health, soil health and productivity, wildlife habitat, improved air and water quality, carbon sequestration potential, resilience, job creation, and enhanced recreational opportunities.
