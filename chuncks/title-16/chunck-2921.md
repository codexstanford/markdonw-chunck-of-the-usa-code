##### (e) “Improved property” defined; determination by Secretary

For the purposes of this subchapter, the term “improved property” means: (i) a detached single family dwelling, the construction of which was begun before January 1, 1975 (hereafter referred to as “dwelling”), together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, the said land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, together with any structures necessary to the dwelling which are situated on the land so designated, or (ii) property developed for agricultural uses, together with any structures accessory thereto which were so used on or before January 1, 1975 . In determining when and to what extent a property is to be considered an “improved property”, the Secretary shall take into consideration the manner of use of such buildings and lands prior to January 1, 1975 , and shall designate such lands as are reasonably necessary for the continued enjoyment of the property in the same manner and to the same extent as existed prior to such date. In applying this subsection with respect to lands and interests therein added to the park by action of the Ninety-fifth Congress, the date “ January 1, 1978 ,” shall be substituted for the date “ January 1, 1975 ,” in each place it appears.
