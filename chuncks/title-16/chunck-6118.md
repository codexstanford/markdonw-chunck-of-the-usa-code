### CHAPTER 12H— PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
#### § 839c. Sale of power
##### (d) Sales to existing direct service industrial customers

(1)

(A) The Administrator is authorized to sell in accordance with this subsection electric power to existing direct service industrial customers. Such sales shall provide a portion of the Administrator’s reserves for firm power loads within the region.

(B) After December 5, 1980 , the Administrator shall offer in accordance with subsection (g) of this section to each existing direct service industrial customer an initial long term contract that provides such customer an amount of power equivalent to that to which such customer is entitled under its contract dated January or April 1975 providing for the sale of “industrial firm power.”

(2) The Administrator shall not sell electric power, including reserves, directly to new direct service industrial customers.

(3) The Administrator shall not sell amounts of electric power, including reserves, to existing direct service industrial customers in excess of the amount permitted under paragraph (1) unless the Administrator determines, after a plan has been adopted pursuant to section 839b of this title , that such proposed sale is consistent with the plan and that

(A) additional power system reserves are required for the region’s firm loads,

(B) the proposed sale would provide a cost-effective method of supplying such reserves,

(C) such loads or loads of similar character cannot provide equivalent operating or planning benefits to the region if served by an electric utility under contractual arrangements providing reserves, and

(D) the Administrator has or can acquire sufficient electric power to serve such loads, and unless the Council has determined such sale is consistent with the plan. After such determination by the Administrator and by the Council, the Administrator is authorized to offer to existing direct service industrial customers power in such amounts in excess of the amount permitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection as the Administrator determines to be necessary to provide additional power system reserves to meet the region’s firm loads.

(4)

(A) As used in this section, the term “existing direct service industrial customer” means any direct service industrial customer of the Administrator which has a contract for the purchase of electric power from the Administrator on December 5, 1980 .

(B) The term “new direct service industrial customer” means any industrial entity other than an existing direct service industrial customer.

(C)

(i) Where a new contract is offered in accordance with subsection (g) to any existing direct service industrial customer which has not received electric power prior to December 5, 1980 , from the Administrator pursuant to a contract with the Administrator existing on December 5, 1980 , electric power delivered under such new contract shall be conditioned on the Administrator reasonably acquiring, in accordance with this chapter and within such estimated period of time (as specified in the contract) as he deems reasonable, sufficient resources to meet, on a planning basis, the load requirement of such customer. Such contract shall also provide that the obligation of the Administrator to acquire such resources to meet such load requirement shall, except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, apply only to such customer and shall not be sold or exchanged by such customer to any other person.

(ii) Rights under a contract described in clause (i) of this subparagraph may be transferred by an existing direct service industrial customer referred to in clause (i) to a successor in interest in connection with a reorganization or other transfer of all major assets of such customer. Following such a transfer, such successor in interest (or any other subsequent successor in interest) may also transfer rights under such a contract only in connection with a reorganization or other transfer of all assets of such successor in interest.

(iii) The limitations of clause (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply to any customer referred to in clause (i) whenever the Administrator determines that such customer is receiving electric power pursuant to a contract referred to in such clause (ii).
