(B) the applicant has the ability, or can reasonably be expected to have the ability after appropriate training of reasonable duration as further provided herein, to perform the duties of the job: Provided , That the full consideration shall not be required with respect to those affected employee applicants requiring training in a situation where the schedule for completion of the work is such that the period during which said employee can reasonably be expected to work following completion of training is determined by the Secretary to be incommensurate with the time and funds required to provide said employee with the necessary training.
