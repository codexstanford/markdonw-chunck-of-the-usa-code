### CHAPTER 31— MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION
#### § 1374. Permits
##### (b) Requisite provisions

Any permit issued under this section shall

(1) be consistent with any applicable regulation established by the Secretary under section 1373 of this title , and

(2) specify

(A) the number and kind of animals which are authorized to be taken or imported,

(B) the location and manner (which manner must be determined by the Secretary to be humane) in which they may be taken, or from which they may be imported,

(C) the period during which the permit is valid, and

(D) any other terms or conditions which the Secretary deems appropriate. In any case in which an application for a permit cites as a reason for the proposed taking the overpopulation of a particular species or population stock, the Secretary shall first consider whether or not it would be more desirable to transplant a number of animals (but not to exceed the number requested for taking in the application) of that species or stock to a location not then inhabited by such species or stock but previously inhabited by such species or stock.
