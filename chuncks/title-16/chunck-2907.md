#### § 460ee. Establishment
##### (c) Acquisition of property; tracts; exchange and disposal of property; transfer from Federal agency to administrative jurisdiction of Secretary; residential property, right of use and occupancy; fair market value; transfer or assignment; lifetime residence of tenant or spouse; accrual of obligation or rental to United States; “improved property” defined; mineral rights

(1) Within the boundaries of the National Area, the Secretary may acquire lands and waters or interests therein by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange or otherwise, except that lands (other than roads and rights-of-way for roads) owned by the States of Kentucky and Tennessee or any political subdivisions thereof which were in public ownership on October 22, 1976 , may be acquired only by donation. When an individual tract of land is only partly within the boundaries of the National Area, the Secretary may acquire all of the tract by any of the above methods in order to avoid the payment of severance costs. Land so acquired outside of the boundaries of the National Area may be exchanged by the Secretary for non-Federal lands within the National Area boundaries, and any portion of the land not utilized for such exchanges may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property within the boundaries of the National Area shall be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purposes of this section.

(2) With the exception of property or any interest in property that the Secretary determines is necessary for purposes of administration, preservation, or public use, any owner or owners (hereafter in this section referred to as “owner”) of improved property used solely for noncommercial residential purposes on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary may retain the right of use and occupancy of such property for such purposes for a term, as the owner may elect, ending either (A) upon the death of the owner or his spouse, whichever occurs later, or (B) not more than twenty-five years from the date of acquisition. The Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value on such date of the term retained by the owner. Such right: shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate to assure that the property is used in accordance with the purposes of this section; may be transferred or assigned; and may be terminated with respect to the entire property by the Secretary upon his determination that the property or any portion thereof has ceased to be used for noncommercial residential purposes, and upon tender to the holder of the right an amount equal to the fair market value, as of the date of the tender, of that portion of the right which remains unexpired on the date of termination. Any person residing upon improved property, subject to the right of acquisition by the Secretary as a tenant or by the sufferance of the owner or owners of the property may be allowed to continue in such residence for the lifetime of such person or his spouse, whichever occurs later, subject to the same restrictions as applicable to owners residing upon such property and provided that any obligation or rental incurred as consideration for such tenancy shall accrue during such term to the United States to be used in the administration of this section.

(3) As used in this section the term “improved property” means a detached year-round one-family dwelling which serves as the owner’s permanent place of abode at the time of acquisition, and construction of which was begun before January 1, 1974 , together with so much of the land on which the dwelling is situated, such land being in the same ownership as the dwelling, as the Secretary shall designate to be reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dwelling for the sole purpose of noncommercial residential use, except that the Secretary may exclude from any improved property any waters or land fronting thereon, together with so much of the land adjoining such waters or land as he deems necessary for public access thereto.

(4) In any case where the Secretary determines that underlying minerals are removable consistent with the provisions of subsection (e)(3) of this section, the owner of the minerals underlying property acquired for the purposes of this section may retain such interest. The Secretary shall reserve the right to inspect and regulate the extraction of such minerals to insure that the values enumerated in subsection (a) are not reduced and that the purposes declared in subsection (e)(1) are not interfered with.
