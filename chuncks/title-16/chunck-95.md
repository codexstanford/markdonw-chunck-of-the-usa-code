(1) Effective on October 2, 1968 , there is hereby vested in the United States all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property within the park boundaries designated in maps NPS–RED–7114–A and NPS–RED–7114–B and effective on March 27, 1978 , there is hereby vested in the United States all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of, all real property within the area indicated as “Proposed Additions” on the map entitled “Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California,” numbered 167–80005–D and dated March 1978, and all right, title, and interest in, and the right to immediate possession of the down tree personal property (trees severed from the ground by man) severed prior to January 1, 1975 , or subsequent to January 31, 1978 , within the area indicated as “Proposed Additions” on the map entitled “Additional Lands, Redwood National Park, California,” numbered 167–80005–D and dated March 1978, except real property owned by the State of California or a political subdivision thereof and except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection. The Secretary shall allow for the orderly termination of all operations on real property acquired by the United States under this subsection, and for the removal of equipment, facilities, and personal property therefrom. Down tree personal property severed subsequent to December 31, 1974 , and prior to February 1, 1978 may be removed in accordance with applicable State and Federal law, or other applicable licenses, permits, and existing agreements, unless the Secretary determines that the removal of such down timber would damage second growth resources or result in excessive sedimentation in Redwood Creek: Provided, however , That down timber lying in stream beds may not be removed without permission of the Secretary: Provided , That such removal shall also be subject to such reasonable conditions as may be required by the Secretary to insure the continued availability of raw materials to Redwoods United, Incorporated, a nonprofit corporation located in Manila, California.

The Secretary shall permit, at existing levels and extent of access and use, continued access and use of each acquired segment of the B line, L line, M line, and K and K roads by each current affected woods employer or its successor in title and interest: Provided , That such use is limited to forest and land management and protection purposes, including timber harvesting and road maintenance. The Secretary shall permit, at existing levels and extent of access and use, continued access and use of acquired portions of the Bald Hills road by each current affected woods employer or its successor in title and interest: Provided further , That nothing in this sentence shall diminish the authority of the Secretary to otherwise regulate the use of the Bald Hills road.

(2) The United States will pay just compensation to the owner of any real property taken by paragraph (1) of this subsection. Such compensation shall be paid either: (A) by the Secretary of the Treasury from money appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, including money appropriated to the Fund pursuant to section 4(b)  1 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, as amended, subject to the appropriation limitation in section 79j of this title , upon certification to him by the Secretary of the agreed negotiated value of such property, or the valuation of the property awarded by judgment, including interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of taking the property to the date of payment therefor; or (B) by the Secretary, if the owner of the land concurs, with any federally owned property available to him for purposes of exchange pursuant to the provisions of section 79e of this title ; or (C) by the Secretary using any combination of such money or federally owned property. Any action against the United States with regard to the provisions of this subchapter and for the recovery of just compensation for the lands and interests therein taken by the United States, and for the down tree personal property taken, shall be brought in the United States district court for the district where the land is located without regard to the amount claimed. The United States may initiate proceedings at any time seeking a determination of just compensation in the district court in the manner provided by sections 1358 and 1403 of title 28 and may deposit in the registry of the court the estimated just compensation, or a part thereof, in accordance with the procedure generally described by section 3114(a)–(d) of title 40. Interest shall not be allowed on such amounts as shall have been paid into the court. In the event that the Secretary determines that the fee simple title to any property (real or personal) taken under this section is not necessary for the purposes of this subchapter, he may, with particular attention to minimizing the payment of severance damages and to allow for the orderly removal of down timber, revest title to such property subject to such reservations, terms, and conditions, if any, as he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, and may compensate the former owner for no more than the fair market value of the rights so reserved, except that the Secretary may not revest title to any property for which just compensation has been paid; or, the Secretary may sell at fair market value without regard to the requirements of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41 such down timber as in his judgment may be removed without damage to the park, the proceeds from such sales being credited to the Treasury of the United States. If the State of California designates a right-of-way for a bypass highway around the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park prior to October 1, 1984 , the Secretary is authorized and directed to acquire such lands or interests in lands as may be necessary for such a highway and, subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine are necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park, shall thereupon donate the designated right-of-way to the State of California for a new bypass highway from a point south of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park through the drainage of May Creek and Boyes Creek to extend along the eastern boundary of Prairie Creek Redwood State Park within Humboldt County. Such acreage as may be necessary in the judgment of the Secretary for this conveyance, and for a buffer thereof, shall be deemed to be a publicly owned highway for purposes of section 79b(a) of this title effective on March 27, 1978 .

(3) This subsection shall apply to ownerships of fifty acres or less only if such ownerships are held or occupied primarily for nonresidential or nonagricultural purposes, and if the Secretary gives notice to the owner within sixty days after October 2, 1968 , of the application of this subsection. Notice by the Secretary shall be deemed to have been made as of October 2, 1968 . The district court of the United States for that district in which such ownerships are located shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action brought by any person having an interest therein for damages occurring by reason of the temporary application of this paragraph, between October 2, 1968 , and the date upon which the Secretary gives such notice. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary under subsections (a) and (c) of this section to acquire such areas for the purposes of this subchapter.
