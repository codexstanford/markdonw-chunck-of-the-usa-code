Such appropriations may be made from the general fund of the Treasury or from revenues due and payable to the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended [ 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.], which would otherwise be credited to miscellaneous receipts.

Additional funds contributed by the State to the Pinelands Development Bank after enactment of this Act, not to exceed $5,000,000, may be counted as part of the State share of land acquisition funds.
