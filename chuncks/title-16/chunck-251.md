##### (e) Limited right of retention; calculation of payment

(1) An owner of improved property which is used solely for noncommercial residential purposes, or for commercial agricultural purposes found to be compatible with the General Management Plan, on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary may retain, as a condition of such an acquisition, a right of use and occupancy of the property for such residential or agricultural purposes. The right retained may be for a definite term which shall not exceed twenty-five years, or in lieu thereof, for a term ending at the death of the owner. The Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value, of the term retained by the owner.

(2) Except for tract number 01–142, paragraph (1) shall not apply to property which the Secretary determines to be necessary for the purposes of administration, development, access, or public use.
