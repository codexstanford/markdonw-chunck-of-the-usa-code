##### (f) Federal power and water resources projects; license and other restrictions; limitations inapplicable to external areas

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall not license the construction of any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works under the Federal Power Act ( 41 Stat. 1063 ) as amended ( 16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.), within or directly affecting the National Area and no department or agency of the United States shall assist by loan, grant, license, or otherwise in the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which the National Area was established. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall preclude licensing of, or assistance to, developments below or above the National Area or on any stream tributary thereto which will not invade the National Area or unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreation, and fish and wildlife values present in the area on March 7, 1974 . No department or agency of the United States shall recommend authorization of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which the National Area was established, or request appropriations to begin construction of any such project, whether heretofore or hereafter authorized, without advising the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior, after jurisdiction over the National Area has been transferred to him under subsection (b) of this section, in writing of its intention so to do at least sixty days in advance, and without specifically reporting to the Congress in writing at the time it makes its recommendations or request in what respect construction of such project would be in conflict with the purposes of this section and would affect the National Area and the values to be protected under this section.
