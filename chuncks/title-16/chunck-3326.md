### CHAPTER 1— NATIONAL PARKS, MILITARY PARKS, MONUMENTS, AND SEASHORES
#### § 460bbb–3. Administration
##### (a) In general

The Secretary shall administer the recreation area in accordance with this subchapter and the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the National Forest System in furtherance of the purposes for which the recreation area was established. In administering the recreation area, the Secretary shall, consistent with the applicable area management emphasis provided under subsection (b), undertake the following:

(1) Provide for a broad range of recreation uses and provide recreational and interpretive services and facilities (including trails and campgrounds) for the public.

(2) Provide and maintain adequate public access, including vehicular roads for general recreational activities such as camping, hiking, hunting, and fishing.

(3) Improve the anadromous fishery and water quality, including (but not limited to) stabilizing landslides, improving fish spawning and rearing habitat, and placing appropriate restrictions or limitations on soil disturbing activities.

(4) Permit the use of off-road vehicles only on designated routes.

(5) Provide for public health and safety and for the protection of the recreation area in the event of fire or infestation of insects or disease.

(6) Permit programmed timber harvest only in those management areas where timber harvest is specifically authorized by subsection (b). Timber management in these areas shall incorporate the use of strategies to reduce habitat fragmentation and employ silvicultural prescriptions designed to maintain or enhance biological diversity and wildlife habitats (such as retention of standing green trees, snags, and other coarse woody debris) by providing for a high level of structural and compositional diversity in managed stands.

(7) Permit removal of trees within streamside protection zones along those rivers and river segments specified in section 460bbb–8 of this title only when necessary for human health and safety, to maintain trails or existing roads, for the development of recreation or other facilities, for the protection of the recreation area in the event of fire, or to improve fish and wildlife habitat.

(8) Consistent with applicable requirements of law, permit removal of trees in those management areas where timber harvest is not specifically authorized by subsection (b) when necessary for human health and safety, to maintain trails or existing roads, for the development of recreation or other facilities, for the protection of the recreation area in the event of fire, or to improve fish and wildlife habitat. Timber damaged or down in these areas as a result of fire, insects, disease, blowdown or other natural events shall otherwise be retained in its natural condition, with removal permitted only upon a written determination by the Secretary, based upon written findings, that such removal is necessary to provide for or maintain or enhance biological and ecological diversity, without regard for the commodity value of the timber. Such a decision shall not be delegable by the Secretary but shall be subject to administrative appeal and judicial review.

(9) Provide for the long-term viability and presence of Port-Orford-cedar and ensure its continued present economic and noneconomic uses through implementation of management strategies developed by the Forest Service.

(10) Except where timber harvest is specifically authorized by subsection (b) protect, preserve, and increase old growth forest habitat in the recreation area.

(11) Provide for the restoration of landscapes damaged by past human activity consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.

(12) Develop a monitoring program to consistently gather water quality, air quality, wildlife, and fisheries data from representative Smith River subwatersheds.

(13) Develop and implement a management plan to maintain, protect, and promote habitat for native resident trout species in the recreation area.

(14) Cooperate with other Federal, State, and local government agencies in coordinating planning efforts throughout the Smith River watershed.
