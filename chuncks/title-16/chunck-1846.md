#### § 425l. Acquisitions and conveyances
##### (c) Alternative access

In order to facilitate the acquisition by the United States of existing easements or rights of access across Federal lands within the park and to provide the owners of such easements or rights of access with alternative rights of access across nonpark lands, the Secretary may acquire, by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange, interests in land of similar estate across lands which are not within the park. With or without the acceptance of payment of cash to equalize the values of the properties, the Secretary may convey such nonpark lands or interests in lands to the holders of such existing easements or rights of access across Federal lands within the park in exchange for their conveyance to the United States of such easements or rights. Nothing in sections 425k to 425 o of this title shall prohibit the Secretary from acquiring any outstanding easements or rights of access across Federal lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or by exchange.
