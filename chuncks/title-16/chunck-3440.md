##### (b) Management guidance

After each review pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall make such revisions as may be needed so that the plan and management program to implement the plan include, in addition to any other necessary or appropriate provisions, provisions for

(1) protection for the raptor populations and habitats and the scientific, cultural, and educational resources and values of the public lands in the conservation area;

(2) identifying levels of continued military use of the Orchard Training Area compatible with paragraph (1) of this subsection;

(3) public use of the conservation area consistent with the purposes of this subchapter;

(4) interpretive and educational opportunities for the public;

(5) a program for continued scientific investigation and study to provide information to support sound management in accordance with this subchapter, to advance knowledge of raptor species and the resources and values of the conservation area, and to provide a process for transferring to other areas of the public lands and elsewhere this knowledge and management experience;

(6) such vegetative enhancement and other measures as may be necessary to restore or enhance prey habitat;

(7) the identification of levels, types, timing, and terms and conditions for the allowable nonmilitary uses of lands within the conservation area that will be compatible with the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of raptor populations and habitats and the other purposes for which the conservation area is established; and

(8) assessing the desirability of imposing appropriate fees for public uses (including, but not limited to, recreational use) of lands in the conservation area, which are not now subject to fees, to be used to further the purposes for which the conservation area is established.
