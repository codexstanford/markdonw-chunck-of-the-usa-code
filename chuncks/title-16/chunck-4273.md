#### § 539l. Designation of James Peak Protection Area, Colorado
##### (d) Management

(1) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Protection Area shall be managed and administered by the Secretary in the same manner as the management area prescription designations identified for these lands in the 1997 Revision of the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest and the Pawnee National Grasslands. Such management and administration shall be in accordance with the following:

(A) Grazing

Nothing in this Act, including the establishment of the Protection Area, shall affect grazing on lands within or outside of the Protection Area.

(B) Mining withdrawal

Subject to valid existing rights, all Federal land within the Protection Area and all land and interests in land acquired for the Protection Area by the United States are withdrawn from

(i) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws;

(ii) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and

(iii) the operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws, and all amendments thereto. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to affect discretionary authority of the Secretary under other Federal laws to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way or other land use authorizations consistent with the other provisions of this Act.

(C) Motorized and mechanized travel

(i) Review and inventory

Not later than two years after August 21, 2002 , the Secretary, in consultation with interested parties, shall complete a review and inventory of all roads and trails in the Protection Area on which use was allowed on September 10, 2001 , except those lands managed under the management prescription referred to in subparagraph (F). During the review and inventory, the Secretary may

(I) connect existing roads and trails in the inventoried area to other existing roads and trails in the inventoried area for the purpose of mechanized and other nonmotorized use on any lands within the Protection Area as long as there is no net gain in the total mileage of either roads or trails open for public use within the Protection Area; and

(II) close or remove roads or trails within the Protection Area that the Secretary determines to be undesirable, except those roads or trails managed pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection or subsection (e)(3).

(ii) After completion of inventory

After completion of the review and inventory required by clause (i), the Secretary shall ensure that motorized and mechanized travel within the Protection Area shall be permitted only on those roads and trails identified as open to use in the inventory or established pursuant to subparagraph (D).

(D) New roads and trails

No new roads or trails shall be established within the Protection Area except those which the Secretary shall establish as follows:

(i) Roads and trails established to replace roads or trails of the same character and scope which have become nonserviceable through reasons other than neglect.

(ii) Nonpermanent roads as needed for hazardous fuels reduction or other control of fire, insect or disease control projects, or other management purposes.

(iii) Roads determined to be appropriate for reasonable access under section 539 l –1(b)(2) of this title.

(iv) A loop trail established pursuant to section 539 l –3 of this title.

(v) Construction of a trail for nonmotorized use following the corridor designated as the Continental Divide Trail.

(E) Timber harvesting

No timber harvesting shall be allowed within the Protection Area except to the extent needed for hazardous fuels reduction or other control of fire, insect or disease control projects, or protection of public health or safety.

(F) Special interest area

The management prescription applicable to the lands described in the 1997 Revision of the Land and Resource Management Plan as the James Peak Special Interest Area shall also be applicable to all the lands in the Protection Area that are bounded on the north by Rollins Pass Road, on the east by the Continental Divide, and on the west by the 11,300 foot elevation contour as shown on the map referred to in subsection (b). In addition, motorized vehicle use shall not be permitted on any part of the Rogers Pass trail.

(2) Natural gas pipeline

The Secretary shall allow for maintenance of rights-of-ways and access roads located within the Protection Area to the extent necessary to operate the natural gas pipeline permitted under the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest master permit numbered 4138.01 in a manner that avoids negative impacts on public safety and allows for compliance with Federal pipeline safety requirements. Such maintenance may include vegetation management, road maintenance, ground stabilization, and motorized vehicle access.

(3) Permanent Federal ownership

All right, title, and interest of the United States, held on or acquired after August 21, 2002 , to lands within the boundaries of the Protection Area shall be retained by the United States.
