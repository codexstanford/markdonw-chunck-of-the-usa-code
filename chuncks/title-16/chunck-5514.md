#### § 777e–1. New England Fishery Resources Restoration Act of 1990
##### (d) Fish passage study

The Director shall conduct a study to identify impediments to upstream and downstream passage of fish in rivers and streams in the New England States due to dams that are not licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other human-caused obstructions. In addition, the study shall identify actions needed to alleviate those impediments where desirable and feasible. The study shall include, but not be limited to, identifying

(1) all dams not licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other human-caused obstructions on New England rivers and streams where construction of upstream or downstream fish passage facilities or their removal would benefit fishery resources, including an estimate of the degree of benefits expected; and

(2) the proposed nature and size and estimated cost of appropriate fish passage facilities or other actions determined to be necessary and feasible or each dam or other obstruction identified in response to paragraph (1). The Director shall provide notice to the public of the extent and nature of the study by publication of such information in major newspapers in the region and by other appropriate means. Within three years of November 16, 1990 , the Director shall submit a report containing the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the study to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
