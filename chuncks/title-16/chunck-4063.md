##### (g) Comprehensive management plan and revisions; approval by Secretary; submission to Congress; approval considerations; disapproval and revision recommendations, notification; resubmission and consideration; Federal assistance, termination; modifications and revisions; reimbursement

(1) The State of New Jersey, through the planning entity, shall adopt and submit to the Secretary a comprehensive management plan within eighteen months after the date that funds are first provided for its preparation under subsection (d). In the event the State fails to submit the plan within such time period, the Secretary may obtain reimbursement or offset from the State of all Federal funds previously granted under this section. The Secretary shall, within ninety days after the date the plan is submitted to him, either approve or disapprove the plan. Should the Secretary fail to act on the proposed plan within ninety days, the plan shall be regarded as approved. Upon approval, the Secretary shall submit the plan to the Congress for a period of ninety days prior to implementation.

(2) In determining whether or not to approve the management plan, the Secretary shall consider whether:

(A) the planning entity has afforded adequate opportunity, including public hearings, for public and governmental involvement in the preparation and review of the plan, and whether such review and comment thereon were considered in the plan or revision as presented to him;

(B) he has received adequate assurances from appropriate State officials that the recommended implementation program identified in the plan will be initiated within a reasonable time after the date of approval of the plan and such program will insure effective implementation of the State and local aspects of the plan;

(C) provision is made for the participation of a Federal representative in the implementation program;

(D) the plan requires the exercise of police power responsibilities to the greatest extent practicable to regulate the use of land and water resources in a manner consistent with the purposes of this section;

(E) the plan, if implemented, would adequately protect the significant natural, ecological, agricultural, scenic, cultural and recreational resources of the Pinelands National Reserve and, consistent with such protection, provide adequate and appropriate outdoor recreational opportunities and economic activities within the area;

(F) the plan provides for the Governor of the State of New Jersey to exercise effective and continuing oversight over its implementation; and

(G) after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the national defense mission of the military installations within, contiguous or adjacent to the Pinelands National Reserve has been adequately provided for.

(3) If the Secretary disapproves the management plan or a revision thereof, he shall, within sixty days after the date of such disapproval, advise the planning entity in writing of the reasons therefor, together with his recommendations for revision. The State of New Jersey, through the planning entity shall, within one hundred and twenty days after receipt by the planning entity of notification of such disapproval, revise and resubmit the plan to the Secretary who shall approve or disapprove a proposed revision within sixty days after the date it is submitted to him. Should the Secretary fail to act on a proposed revision within sixty days, the revision shall be considered as approved.

(4) The Secretary shall consider a plan revision in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (2). Such revisions must be consistent with the purposes of this section.

(5) In the event that the planning entity fails to obtain approval of the plan by the Secretary within thirty-six months after the date funds are first provided under subsection (d) for development of the plan, the Secretary shall terminate all Federal assistance for and participation in the development of such plan, and may obtain reimbursement or offset from the State of New Jersey of all Federal funds previously granted under this section.

(6) The Secretary shall provide technical assistance for and monitor at periodic intervals the implementation of the approved management plan. A local jurisdiction or the State shall obtain the approval of the Secretary prior to any modification of the approved plan. The Secretary shall consider a plan revision in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (2). Such revisions must be consistent with the purposes of this section. Any jurisdiction that implements changes to the approved management plan, or adopts or acquiesces in changes to laws, regulations, or policies adopted to implement such plan, without approval of the Secretary, may be liable for reimbursement or offset of all Federal funds previously granted to it under this section without regard to such additional terms and conditions or other requirements of law that may be applicable to such grants.
