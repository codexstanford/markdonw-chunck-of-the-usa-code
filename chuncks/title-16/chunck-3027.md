#### § 460kk. Establishment
##### (n) Comprehensive plan; contents; approval considerations; environmental consultations; grants and funds; assurance and grant requirements; plan changes: liability for reimbursement of funds, approval by Secretary

(1) The Secretary shall request the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission to submit a comprehensive plan, prepared in accord with this section and title 7.75 of the California Government Code (commencing with section 67450), for the Santa Monica Mountains Zone generally depicted on the map referred to in subsection (c) of this section for approval.

(2) The comprehensive plan shall include, in addition to the requirements of California State law

(A) an identification and designation of public and private uses which are compatible with and which would not significantly impair the significant scenic, recreational, educational, scientific, natural, archeological, and public health benefits present in the zone and which would not have an adverse impact on the recreation area or on the air quality of the south coast air basin;

(B) a specific minimum land acquisition program which shall include, but not be limited to, fee and less than fee acquisition of strategic and critical sites not to be acquired by the Federal Government for public recreational and other related uses; and a program for the complementary use of State and local authority to regulate the use of lands and waters within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone to the fullest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this section; and

(C) a recreation transportation system which may include but need not be limited to existing public transit.

(3) No plan submitted to the Secretary under this section shall be approved unless the Secretary finds the plan consistent with paragraph (2) and finds that

(A) the planning commission has afforded adequate opportunity, including public hearings, for public involvement in the preparation and review of the plan, and public comments were received and considered in the plan or revision as presented to him;

(B) the State and local units of government identified in the plan as responsible for implementing its provisions have the necessary authority to implement the plan and such State and local units of government have indicated their intention to use such authority to implement the plan;

(C) the plan, if implemented, would preserve significant natural, historical, and archeological benefits and, consistent with such benefits, provide increased recreational opportunities for persons residing in the greater Los Angeles-southern California metropolitan area; and

(D) implementation of the plan would not have a serious adverse impact on the air quality or public health of the greater Los Angeles region. Before making his findings on the air quality and public health impacts of the plan, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

(4) Following approval of the plan with respect to the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, upon receipt of adequate assurances that all aspects of that jurisdiction’s implementation responsibilities will be adopted and put into effect, the Secretary shall

(A) provide grants to the State and through the State to local governmental bodies for acquisition of lands, waters, and interests therein identified in paragraph (2)(B), and for development of essential public facilities, except that such grants shall be made only for the acquisition of lands, waters, and interests therein, and related essential public facilities, for park, recreation, and conservation purposes; and

(B) provide, subject to agreements that in the opinion of the Secretary will assure additional preservation of the lands and waters of the zone, such funds as may be necessary to retire bonded indebtedness for water and sewer and other utilities already incurred by property owners which in the opinion of the Secretary would if left outstanding contribute to further development of the zone in a manner inconsistent with the approved plan developed by the planning commission. No grant for acquisition of land may be made under subparagraph (A) unless the Secretary receives satisfactory assurances that such lands acquired under subparagraph (A) shall not be converted to other than park, recreation, and conservation purposes without the approval of the Secretary and without provision for suitable replacement land.

(5) Grants under this section shall be made only upon application of the recipient State and shall be in addition to any other Federal financial assistance for any other program, and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. Any jurisdiction that implements changes to the approved plan which are inconsistent with the purposes of this section, or adopts or acquiesces in changes to laws, regulations or policies necessary to implement or protect the approved plan, without approval of the Secretary, may be liable for reimbursement of all funds previously granted or available to it under the terms of this section without regard to such additional terms and conditions or other requirements of law that may be applicable to such grants. During the life of the planning commission, changes to the plan must be submitted by the planning commission to the Secretary for approval. No such application for a grant may be made after the date five years from the date of the Secretary’s approval of the plan.
