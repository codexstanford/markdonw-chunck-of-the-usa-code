### CHAPTER 38— FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
#### § 1881. Registration and information management
##### (g) Recreational fisheries

(1) Federal program

The Secretary shall establish and implement a regionally based registry program for recreational fishermen in each of the 8 fishery management regions. The program, which shall not require a fee before January 1, 2011 , shall provide for

(A) the registration (including identification and contact information) of individuals who engage in recreational fishing

(i) in the Exclusive Economic Zone;

(ii) for anadromous species; or

(iii) for Continental Shelf fishery resources beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone; and

(B) if appropriate, the registration (including the ownership, operator, and identification of the vessel) of vessels used in such fishing.

(2) State programs

The Secretary shall exempt from registration under the program recreational fishermen and charter fishing vessels licensed, permitted, or registered under the laws of a State if the Secretary determines that information from the State program is suitable for the Secretary’s use or is used to assist in completing marine recreational fisheries statistical surveys, or evaluating the effects of proposed conservation and management measures for marine recreational fisheries.

(3) Data collection

(A) Improvement of the marine recreational fishery statistics survey

Within 24 months after January 12, 2007 , the Secretary, in consultation with representatives of the recreational fishing industry and experts in statistics, technology, and other appropriate fields, shall establish a program to improve the quality and accuracy of information generated by the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey, with a goal of achieving acceptable accuracy and utility for each individual fishery.

(B) NRC report recommendations

The program shall take into consideration and, to the extent feasible, implement the recommendations of the National Research Council in its report Review of Recreational Fisheries Survey Methods (2006), including

(i) redesigning the Survey to improve the effectiveness and appropriateness of sampling and estimation procedures, its applicability to various kinds of management decisions, and its usefulness for social and economic analyses; and

(ii) providing for ongoing technical evaluation and modification as needed to meet emerging management needs.

(C) Methodology

Unless the Secretary determines that alternate methods will achieve this goal more efficiently and effectively, the program shall, to the extent possible, include

(i) an adequate number of intercepts to accurately estimate recreational catch and effort;

(ii) use of surveys that target anglers registered or licensed at the State or Federal level to collect participation and effort data;

(iii) collection and analysis of vessel trip report data from charter fishing vessels;

(iv) development of a weather corrective factor that can be applied to recreational catch and effort estimates; and

(v) an independent committee composed of recreational fishermen, academics, persons with expertise in stock assessments and survey design, and appropriate personnel from the National Marine Fisheries Service to review the collection estimates, geographic, and other variables related to dockside intercepts and to identify deficiencies in recreational data collection, and possible correction measures.

(D) Deadline

The Secretary shall complete the program under this paragraph and implement the improved Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey not later than January 1, 2009 .

(4) Federal-State partnerships

(A) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a partnership with a State to develop best practices for implementing the State program established under paragraph (2).

(B) Guidance

The Secretary shall develop guidance, in cooperation with the States, that details best practices for administering State programs pursuant to paragraph (2), and provide such guidance to the States.

(C) Biennial report

The Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress and publish biennial reports that include

(i) the estimated accuracy of

(I) the information provided under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) for each registry program established under that paragraph; and

(II) the information from each State program that is used to assist in completing surveys or evaluating effects of conservation and management measures under paragraph (2);

(ii) priorities for improving recreational fishing data collection; and

(iii) an explanation of any use of information collected by such State programs and by the Secretary.

(D) States grant program

(i) In general

The Secretary may make grants to States to

(I) improve implementation of State programs consistent with this subsection; and

(II) assist such programs in complying with requirements related to changes in recreational data collection under paragraph (3).

(ii) Use of funds

Any funds awarded through such grants shall be used to support data collection, quality assurance, and outreach to entities submitting such data. The Secretary shall prioritize such grants based on the ability of the grant to improve the quality and accuracy of such programs.

(5) Report

Within 24 months after establishment of the program, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that describes the progress made toward achieving the goals and objectives of the program.
