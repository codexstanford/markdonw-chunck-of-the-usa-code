### CHAPTER 38— FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
#### § 1883. Gulf of Mexico red snapper research
##### (d) Catch limits

Any fishery management plan, plan amendment, or regulation submitted by the Gulf Council for the red snapper fishery after October 11, 1996 , shall contain conservation and management measures that

(1) establish separate quotas for recreational fishing (which, for the purposes of this subsection shall include charter fishing) and commercial fishing that, when reached, result in a prohibition on the retention of fish caught during recreational fishing and commercial fishing, respectively, for the remainder of the fishing year; and

(2) ensure that such quotas reflect allocations among such sectors and do not reflect any harvests in excess of such allocations.
