### CHAPTER 38— FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
#### § 1854. Action by Secretary
##### (i) 2 International overfishing

The provisions of this subsection shall apply in lieu of subsection (e) to a fishery that the Secretary determines is overfished or approaching a condition of being overfished due to excessive international fishing pressure, and for which there are no management measures to end overfishing under an international agreement to which the United States is a party. For such fisheries

(1) the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, 3 immediately take appropriate action at the international level to end the overfishing; and

(2) within 1 year after the Secretary’s determination, the appropriate Council, or Secretary, for fisheries under section 1852(a)(3) of this title shall

(A) develop recommendations for domestic regulations to address the relative impact of fishing vessels of the United States on the stock and, if developed by a Council, the Council shall submit such recommendations to the Secretary; and

(B) develop and submit recommendations to the Secretary of State, and to the Congress, for international actions that will end overfishing in the fishery and rebuild the affected stocks, taking into account the relative impact of vessels of other nations and vessels of the United States on the relevant stock.
