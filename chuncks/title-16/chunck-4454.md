##### (i) Review by Commission

(1) The Commission shall review the special management area land use ordinance received from each county, and within ninety days after receipt shall make a tentative determination as to whether the ordinance is consistent with the management plan. If the Commission makes a tentative determination that the land use ordinance is consistent with the management plan, the Commission shall send the ordinance to the Secretary for concurrence.

(2) If the Commission makes a tentative determination that the land use ordinance is inconsistent with the management plan, the Commission shall state the reasons for the determination and shall return the ordinance to the appropriate county with suggested modifications required for consistency with the management plan.

(3) Each county shall have ninety days after it is notified by the Commission to make modifications designed to eliminate the inconsistencies and to resubmit the ordinance to the Commission for tentative determination of consistency. The Commission shall have sixty days to make a tentative consistency determination on the resubmitted ordinance. If found consistent, the land use ordinance shall be transmitted by the Commission to the Secretary for concurrence that the ordinance is consistent with the management plan. If the Commission finds the resubmitted ordinance inconsistent, the Commission shall adopt an ordinance pursuant to subsection ( l ) of this section.
