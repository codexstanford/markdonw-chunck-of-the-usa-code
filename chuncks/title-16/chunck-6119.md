### CHAPTER 12H— PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
#### § 839c. Sale of power
##### (e) Contractual entitlements to firm power

(1) The contractual entitlement to firm power of any customer from whom, or on whose behalf, the Administrator has acquired electric power pursuant to section 839d of this title may not be restricted below the amount of electric power so acquired from, or on behalf of, such customer. If in any year such customer’s requirements are less than such entitlement, any excess of such entitlement shall be first made available to increase the entitlement of other customers of the same class before being available for the entitlement of other customers. For purposes of this paragraph, the following entities shall each constitute a class:

(A) public bodies and cooperatives;

(B) Federal agencies;

(C) direct service industrial; and

(D) investor owned utilities.

(2) Any contractual entitlement to firm power which is based on electric power acquired from, or on behalf of, a customer pursuant to section 839d of this title shall be in addition to any other contractual entitlement to firm power not subject to restriction that such customer may have under this section. For the purposes of this subsection, references to amounts of power acquired by the Administrator pursuant to section 839d of this title shall be deemed to mean the amounts specified in the resource acquisition contracts exclusive of any amounts recognized in such contracts as replacement for Federal base system resources.

(3) The Administrator shall, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, insure that any restrictions upon any particular customer class made pursuant to this subsection and subsection (b) of this section are distributed equitably throughout the region.
