If the recommendations are not received by the Council by this date, the Council may proceed to make final recommendations on project funding to BPA, relying on the best information available. The Panel and Peer Review Groups shall review a sufficient number of projects to adequately ensure that the list of prioritized projects recommended is consistent with the Council’s program. Project recommendations shall be based on a determination that projects: are based on sound science principles; benefit fish and wildlife; and have a clearly defined objective and outcome with provisions for monitoring and evaluation of results. The Panel, with assistance from the Peer Review Groups, shall review, on an annual basis, the results of prior year expenditures based upon these criteria and submit its findings to the Council for its review.
