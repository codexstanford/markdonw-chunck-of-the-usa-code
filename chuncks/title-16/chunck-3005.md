#### § 460jj–1. Land acquisition
##### (c) Exchange of property; cash equalization

In exercising the authority conferred by this section to acquire property by exchange, the Secretary may accept title to any non-Federal land, or interests therein, located within the Arapaho National Recreation Area and the Secretary may convey in exchange therefor any federally owned lands or interests inlands within the State of Colorado which are classified by the Secretary as suitable for exchange and which are under the Secretary’s administrative jurisdiction. The values of any lands or interests in lands so exchanged shall be approximately equal, or if they are not approximately equal, they shall be equalized by the payment of cash to the grantor or to the Secretary so long as payment does not exceed 25 per centum of the total value of the land or interest in land. In utilizing cash equalization in exchanges the Secretary shall try to reduce the amount of the payment of money to as small an amount as possible. In the exercise of his exchange authority, the Secretary may utilize authorities and procedures available to him in making exchanges of national forest lands.
