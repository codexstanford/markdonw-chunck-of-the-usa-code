Lands, and interests in lands, within the boundaries of the park which are owned by the United States Virgin Islands, or any political subdivision thereof, may be acquired only by donation or exchange. No lands, or interests therein, containing dwellings lying within the park boundary as of July 1, 1991 , may be acquired without the consent of the owner, unless the Secretary determines, after consultation with the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, that the land is being developed or proposed to be developed in a manner which is detrimental to the natural, scenic, historic, and other values for which the park was established.
