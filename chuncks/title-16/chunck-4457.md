#### § 544f. Administration of special management areas
##### (l) Commission ordinances

(1) Within ninety days after making a determination that a county has failed to comply with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section, the Commission shall make and publish an ordinance setting standards for the use of non-Federal lands of such county within the boundaries of the special management areas. The ordinances shall have the object of assuring that the use of such lands is consistent with the management plan. The ordinances may differ amongst the several parcels of land within the boundaries of the special management areas. The ordinances may from time to time be amended by the Commission.

(2) The Commission shall promptly submit the ordinance to the Secretary. The Secretary shall, within ninety days after receipt of the ordinance from the Commission, concur with the tentative determination that the land use ordinance is consistent with the management plan unless a determination of inconsistency is made. Any ordinance submitted to the Secretary shall become effective upon concurrence. Should the Secretary fail to concur within ninety days, the land use ordinance shall be effective.

(3) If concurrence is denied, the Secretary shall state the reasons for finding the ordinance is inconsistent with the management plan, and shall submit to the Commission suggested modifications to the ordinance to make it consistent with the plan.

(4) The Commission shall have ninety days after it receives recommendations from the Secretary to make modifications designed to eliminate the inconsistencies and to resubmit the ordinance to the Secretary for concurrence. The Secretary shall have sixty days to concur with the resubmitted ordinance. Any resubmitted ordinance shall become effective upon concurrence by the Secretary. Should the Secretary deny concurrence for the resubmitted ordinance, the Secretary shall state the reasons therefor and shall promptly resubmit the ordinance for reconsideration. Should the Secretary fail to concur within sixty days, the ordinance shall be deemed effective.

(5) Within one hundred twenty days after receipt of notification of non-concurrence, the Commission shall

(A) revise and resubmit the land use ordinance to the Secretary; or

(B) by a vote of two-thirds of its membership, including a majority of the members appointed from each State, reject the suggested modifications of the Secretary and adopt a land use ordinance consistent with the provisions of this section and the purposes of sections 544 to 544p of this title.
