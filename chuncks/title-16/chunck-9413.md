#### § 6403. National coral reef resilience strategy
##### (b) Elements

The strategy required by subsection (a) shall include the following:

(1) A discussion addressing

(A) continuing and emerging threats to the resilience of United States coral reef ecosystems;

(B) remaining gaps in coral reef ecosystem research, monitoring, and assessment;

(C) the status of management cooperation and integration among Federal reef managers and covered reef managers;

(D) the status of efforts to manage and disseminate critical information, and enhance interjurisdictional data sharing, related to research, reports, data sets, and maps;

(E) areas of special focus, which may include

(i) improving natural coral recruitment;

(ii) preventing avoidable losses of corals and their habitat;

(iii) enhancing the resilience of coral populations;

(iv) supporting a resilience-based management approach;

(v) developing, coordinating, and implementing watershed management plans;

(vi) building and sustaining watershed management capacity at the local level;

(vii) providing data essential for coral reef fisheries management;

(viii) building capacity for coral reef fisheries management;

(ix) increasing understanding of coral reef ecosystem services;

(x) educating the public on the importance of coral reefs, threats and solutions; and

(xi) evaluating intervention efficacy;

(F) the status of conservation efforts, including the use of marine protected areas to serve as replenishment zones developed consistent with local practices and traditions and in cooperation with, and with respect for the scientific, technical, and management expertise and responsibilities of, covered reef managers;

(G) science-based adaptive management and restoration efforts; and

(H) management of coral reef emergencies and disasters.

(2) A statement of national goals and objectives designed to guide

(A) future Federal coral reef management and restoration activities authorized under section 6402 of this title ;

(B) conservation and restoration priorities for grants awarded under section 6410 of this title ; and

(C) research priorities for the reef research coordination institutes designated under section 6412(b)(1)(B)  1 of this title.

(3) A designation of priority areas for conservation, and priority areas for restoration, to support the review and approval of grants under section 6410(e) of this title .

(4) Technical assistance in the form of general templates for use by covered reef managers and Federal reef managers to guide the development of coral reef action plans under section 6404 of this title , including guidance on the best science-based practices to respond to coral reef emergencies that can be included in coral reef action plans.
