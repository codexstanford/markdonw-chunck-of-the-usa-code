#### § 281c. Inclusion of lands
##### (a) Indian trust land; Federal-ownership sites; cooperation with Nez Perce Tribe and administrative agencies in research, services, and facilities for public access, use and enjoyment, and conservation of resources

Indian trust land may be designated by the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion in the Nez Perce National Historical Park with the concurrence of the beneficial owner. Sites in Federal ownership under the administrative jurisdiction of other Government agencies may likewise be designated by the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion in the Nez Perce National Historical Park with the concurrence of the agency having administrative responsibility therefor, but such designation shall effect no transfer of administrative control unless the administering agency consents thereto. The Secretary of the Interior may cooperate with the Nez Perce Tribe or the administering agency, as the case may be, in research into and interpretation of the significance of any site so designated and in providing desirable interpretive services and facilities and other facilities required for public access to and use and enjoyment of the site and in conservation of the scenic and other resources thereof.
