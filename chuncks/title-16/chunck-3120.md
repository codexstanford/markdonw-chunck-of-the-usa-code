#### § 460ss–5. Appropriations
##### (b) Cost-sharing

(1) 50 percent of the cost of the development and implementation of the program must be provided by one or more non-Federal sources on a basis considered by the Secretary to be timely and appropriate. For purposes of this subsection, the term “non-Federal source” includes a State or local government, any private entity, and any individual.

(2) In addition to cash outlays, the Secretary shall consider as financial contributions by a non-Federal source the value of inkind contributions and real and personal property provided by the source for purposes of implementing the program. Valuations made by the Secretary under this paragraph are final and not subject to judicial review.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), inkind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited to, personal services rendered by volunteers.

(4) The Secretary shall by regulation establish

(A) the training, experience, and other qualifications which such volunteers must have in order for their services to be considered as inkind contributions; and

(B) the standards under which the Secretary will determine the value of inkind contributions and real and personal property for purposes of paragraph (2).

(5) The Secretary may not consider the expenditure, either directly or indirectly, with respect to the program of Federal moneys received by a State or local government to be a financial contribution by a non-Federal source to carry out the program.
