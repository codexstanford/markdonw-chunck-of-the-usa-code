#### § 471i. Pinelands National Reserve
##### (i) Applications for Federal construction assistance; review by planning entity; notifications; commencement of review process

During the development of the management plan for the Pinelands National Reserve, all applications for Federal assistance under programs covered by Part I of OMB Circular A–95 and direct Federal actions covered by Part II of OMB Circular A–95 within the Federal Project Review Area generally depicted on the map referred to in subsection (c) which involve the construction of housing, industrial parks, highways, or sewage or water treatment facilities shall be reviewed by the planning entity, upon receipt from the New Jersey State A–95 Clearinghouse (hereinafter referred to as the Clearinghouse). If the planning entity finds that such application or proposed action would have no adverse impact on the resources and ecological values of the Federal Project Review Area, the planning entity shall so notify the Clearinghouse. If the planning entity does not so find, Congress authorizes the planning entity to notify the Clearinghouse and other affected parties that such application or proposed action shall not proceed pending further review, and the planning entity shall forward such application or notice of proposed action to the Secretary. Any such application or proposed action which the Secretary determines would be significantly adverse to the purposes of this section shall not proceed while the management plan is being developed. The review process established under this subsection shall begin upon the appropriation of funds under subsection (k).
