#### § 460ee. Establishment
##### (g) Transportation facilities; study and establishment

The Secretary shall study transportation facilities in the region served by the National Area and shall establish transportation facilities to enhance public access to the National Area. In this connection the Secretary is authorized to acquire and maintain public roads, other than State highways, necessary to serve the public use facilities within the National Area, and to establish and maintain, at Federal cost an interior and circulating road system sufficient to meet the purposes of this section. Any existing public road, which at the time of its acquisition continues to be a necessary and essential part of the county highway system, may, upon mutual agreement between the Secretary and the owner of such road, be relocated outside of the National Area and if not so relocated such road shall be maintained at Federal expense and kept open at all times for general travel purposes. Nothing in this subsection shall abrogate the right of egress and ingress of those persons who may remain in occupancy under subsection (c) of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the adjustment, relocation, reconstruction, or abandonment of State highways situated in the National Area, with the concurrence of the agency having the custody of such highways upon entering into such arrangements as the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior, after jurisdiction over the National Area has been transferred to him under subsection (b) of this section, deems appropriate and in the best interest of the general welfare.
