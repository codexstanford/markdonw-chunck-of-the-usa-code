(2) Traditional and customary uses of existing cabins and related structures on Federal lands within a unit or area may be allowed to continue in accordance with a nontransferable, renewable five-year special use permit issued by the Secretary. Such special use permit shall be issued only upon a determination that the traditional and customary uses are compatible with the purposes for which the unit or area was established. No special use permits shall be issued to authorize the use of an existing cabin constructed for private recreational use.

(3) No special use permit shall be issued under paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection unless the permit applicant:
