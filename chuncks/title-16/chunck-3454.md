(1) The Congress finds that the United States is currently a party in an adjudication of rights to waters of the Snake River, including water rights claimed by the United States on the basis of the reservation of lands for purposes of conservation of fish and wildlife and that consequently there is no need for this subchapter to effect a reservation by the United States of rights with respect to such waters in order to fulfill the purposes for which the conservation area is established.

(2) Nothing in this subchapter or any action taken pursuant thereto shall constitute either an expressed or implied reservation of water or water rights for any purpose.

(3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as effecting a relinquishment or reduction of any of the water rights held or claimed by the United States within the State of Idaho or elsewhere on or before August 4, 1993 .

(4) The Secretary and all other officers of the United States shall take all steps necessary to protect all water rights claimed by the United States in the Snake River adjudication now pending in the district court of the State of Idaho in which the United States is joined under section 666 of title 43 .
