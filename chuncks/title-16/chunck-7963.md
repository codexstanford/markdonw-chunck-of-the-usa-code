##### (f) Information to consumers

(1) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title , each electric utility shall transmit to each of its electric consumers a clear and concise explanation of the existing rate schedule and any rate schedule applied for (or proposed by a nonregulated electric utility) applicable to such consumer. Such statement shall be transmitted to each such consumer

(A) not later than sixty days after the date of commencement of service to such consumer or ninety days after the standard established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title is adopted with respect to such electric utility, whichever last occurs, and

(B) not later than thirty days (sixty days in the case of an electric utility which uses a bimonthly billing system) after such utility’s application for any change in a rate schedule applicable to such consumer (or proposal of such a change in the case of a nonregulated utility).

(2) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title , each electric utility shall transmit to each of its electric consumers not less frequently than once each year

(A) a clear and concise summary of the existing rate schedules applicable to each of the major classes of its electric consumers for which there is a separate rate, and

(B) an identification of any classes whose rates are not summarized. Such summary may be transmitted together with such consumer’s billing or in such other manner as the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility deems appropriate.

(3) For purposes of the standard for information to consumers established by section 2623(b)(3) of this title , each electric utility, on request of an electric consumer of such utility, shall transmit to such consumer a clear and concise statement of the actual consumption (or degree-day adjusted consumption) of electric energy by such consumer for each billing period during the prior year (unless such consumption data is not reasonably ascertainable by the utility).
