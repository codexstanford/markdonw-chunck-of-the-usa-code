#### § 823f. Closed-loop pumped storage projects
##### (c) Exceptions from other requirements

(1) In general

In issuing or amending a license for a closed-loop pumped storage project pursuant to the expedited process established under this section, the Commission may grant an exception from any other requirement of this subchapter with respect to any part of the closed-loop pumped storage project (not including any dam or other impoundment).

(2) Consultation

In granting an exception under paragraph (1), the Commission shall consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the State agency exercising administration over the fish and wildlife resources of the State in which the closed-loop pumped storage project is or will be located, in the manner provided by the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act ( 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.).

(3) Terms and conditions

In granting an exception under paragraph (1), the Commission shall include in any such exception

(A) such terms and conditions as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the State agency described in paragraph (2) each determine are appropriate to prevent loss of, or damage to, fish and wildlife resources and to otherwise carry out the purposes of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; and

(B) such terms and conditions as the Commission deems appropriate to ensure that such closed-loop pumped storage project continues to comply with the provisions of this section and terms and conditions included in any such exception.

(4) Fees

The Commission, in addition to the requirements of section 803(e) of this title , shall establish fees which shall be paid by an applicant for a license for a closed-loop pumped storage project that is required to meet terms and conditions set by fish and wildlife agencies under paragraph (3). Such fees shall be adequate to reimburse the fish and wildlife agencies referred to in paragraph (3) for any reasonable costs incurred in connection with any studies or other reviews carried out by such agencies for purposes of compliance with this section. The fees shall, subject to annual appropriations Acts, be transferred to such agencies by the Commission for use solely for purposes of carrying out such studies and shall remain available until expended.
