(1) Modification and termination

The Secretary may modify or terminate a floodplain easement administered by the Secretary under this section if

(ii) is in the public interest.

(2) Consideration

(A) Termination

As consideration for termination of an easement and associated agreements under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall enter into compensatory arrangements as determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.

In the case of a modification under paragraph (1)

(i) as a condition of the modification, the current owner shall enter into a compensatory arrangement (as determined to be appropriate by the Secretary) to incur the costs of modification; and

(ii) the Secretary shall ensure that

(I) the modification will not adversely affect the floodplain functions and values for which the easement was acquired;

(II) any adverse impacts will be mitigated by enrollment and restoration of other land that provides greater floodplain functions and values at no additional cost to the Federal Government; and

(III) the modification will result in equal or greater environmental and economic values to the United States.
