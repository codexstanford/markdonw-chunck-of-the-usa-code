### CHAPTER 41— COOPERATIVE FORESTRY ASSISTANCE
#### § 2105. Urban and community forestry assistance
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) the health of forests in urban areas and communities, including cities, their suburbs, and towns, in the United States is on the decline;

(2) forest lands, shade trees, and open spaces in urban areas and communities improve the quality of life for residents;

(3) forest lands and associated natural resources enhance the economic value of residential and commercial property in urban and community settings;

(4) urban trees are 15 times more effective than forest trees at reducing the buildup of carbon dioxide and aid in promoting energy conservation through mitigation of the heat island effect in urban areas;

(5) tree plantings and ground covers such as low growing dense perennial turfgrass sod in urban areas and communities can aid in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating the heat island effect, and reducing energy consumption, thus contributing to efforts to reduce global warming trends;

(6) efforts to encourage tree plantings and protect existing open spaces in urban areas and communities can contribute to the social well-being and promote a sense of community in these areas; and

(7) strengthened research, education, technical assistance, and public information and participation in tree planting and maintenance programs for trees and complementary ground covers for urban and community forests are needed to provide for the protection and expansion of tree cover and open space in urban areas and communities.
