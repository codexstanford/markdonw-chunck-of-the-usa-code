#### § 539g. Kings River Special Management Area
##### (c) Administration

The Secretary shall administer the special management area in accordance with this Act and with the provisions of law generally applicable to units of the National Forest System. In the case of any conflict between the provisions of such Acts, the provisions of this Act shall govern. In the administration of the special management area the Secretary may utilize such statutory authority as may be available to him for the conservation of wildlife and natural resources as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit grazing within the special management area to the same extent, and in accordance with the same rules and regulations as applicable in the absence of this Act. The Secretary may permit the cutting of timber within the special management area only in those cases where in the judgment of the Secretary the cutting of such timber is required in order to control the attacks of fire, insects, or diseases or to otherwise conserve the scenery or the natural or historical objects in the area.
