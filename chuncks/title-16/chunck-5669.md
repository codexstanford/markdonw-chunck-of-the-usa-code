### CHAPTER 12— FEDERAL REGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF POWER
#### § 824a. Interconnection and coordination of facilities; emergencies; transmission to foreign countries
##### (e) Transmission of electric energy to foreign country

After six months from August 26, 1935 , no person shall transmit any electric energy from the United States to a foreign country without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so. The Commission shall issue such order upon application unless, after opportunity for hearing, it finds that the proposed transmission would impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or would impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission may by its order grant such application in whole or in part, with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time to time, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find necessary or appropriate.
