#### § 79l. Employment of personnel for rehabilitation, protection, and improvements of additional lands
##### (g) Implementation of requirements

(1) The Secretary, except as otherwise provided, shall be responsible for the implementation of this section and

(A) is authorized and directed to make needed training available, upon application, to an affected employee applicant who, although not presently qualified for a position, can be reasonably expected to be qualified after appropriate training;

(B) is authorized to take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that an affected employee is not denied full consideration because of the need for training where there is no substantial reason to believe that the applicant would be unable to perform the duties of the job after proper training. If the job is one which must be filled while the affected employee would be in training, the Secretary shall encourage the employer to fill the job only on a temporary basis subject to the successful completion of the training by the affected employee;

(C) shall require that, in a case in which two or more affected employee applicants have approximately equal qualifications for a job for which they are to receive full consideration, that applicant with the greatest creditable service shall be given preference among those applicants entitled to full consideration; and

(D) upon the filing of a complaint by an employee who alleges that said employee’s rights to full consideration were disregarded, the Secretary shall make a finding on the merits of such complaint. If it is determined that there has been noncompliance with this section, the Secretary shall take such action as may be appropriate to correct the situation.

(2) To assist in implementing this section, agencies shall notify the Secretary, in advance, of any job opening as provided for by subsection (d) and of any Federal commitment as provided for by subsection (e).

(3) The Secretary shall

(A) seek the cooperation of the State of California and the county and local governments within Humboldt and Del Norte Counties in the implementation of the provisions of this section and in the adoption of similar provisions for full consideration of affected employees with regard to State, county, and local jobs and activities; and

(B) appoint, from among nominees proposed by certified or recognized unions representing employees, a person or persons who shall serve as the Secretary’s liaison with employees and their union and as consultant to the Secretary with regard to the administration of those provisions of this Act for which the Secretary is responsible.
