In order to accommodate visitation to the recreation area, the Secretary shall construct such facilities as necessary to enhance and improve access, vehicle parking and related facilities, and provide river access for whitewater recreation and for other recreational activities, immediately downstream of the Summersville Dam, to the extent that such facilities are not provided pursuant to section 460ww–4 of this title and such facilities are within the boundaries of the recreation area. Such construction shall be subject to the memorandum of understanding referred to in subsection (f).

Such actions by the Secretary shall include the construction of parking and related facilities in the vicinity of Woods Ferry for noncommercial use on lands acquired pursuant to paragraph (3) or on lands acquired with the consent of the owner thereof within the boundaries of the recreation area.

(B) If necessary, in the discretion of the Secretary, in order to minimize environmental impacts, including visual impacts, within portions of the recreation area immediately adjacent to the river, the Secretary may, by contract or otherwise, provide transportation services for noncommercial visitors, at reasonable cost, between such parking facilities and the river.

(C) Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall affect the rights of any person to continue to utilize, pursuant to a lease in effect on April 1, 1993 , any right of way acquired pursuant to such lease which authorizes such person to use an existing road referred to in subparagraph (A). Except as provided under paragraph (2) relating to access immediately downstream of the Summersville project, until there is compliance with this paragraph the Secretary is prohibited from acquiring or developing any other river access points within the recreation area.
