##### (e) Acquisition of certain property on Santa Cruz Island

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective 90 days after November 12, 1996 , all right, title, and interest in and to, and the right to immediate possession of, the real property on the eastern end of Santa Cruz Island which is known as the Gherini Ranch is hereby vested in the United States, except for the reserved rights of use and occupancy set forth in Instrument No. 90–027494 recorded in the Official Records of the County of Santa Barbara, California.

(2) The United States shall pay just compensation to the owners of any real property taken pursuant to this subsection, determined as of the date of taking. The full faith and credit of the United States is hereby pledged to the payment of any judgment entered against the United States with respect to the taking of such property. Payment shall be in the amount of the agreed negotiated value of such real property plus interest or the valuation of such real property awarded by judgment plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date of taking to the date of payment. Interest shall be compounded quarterly and computed at the rate applicable for the period involved, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities from November 12, 1996 , to the last day of the month preceding the date on which payment is made.

(3) In the absence of a negotiated settlement, or an action by the owner, within 1 year after November 12, 1996 , the Secretary shall initiate a proceeding, seeking in a court of competent jurisdiction a determination of just compensation with respect to the taking of such property.

(4) The Secretary shall not allow any unauthorized use of the lands to be acquired under this subsection, except that the Secretary shall permit the orderly termination of all current activities and the removal of any equipment, facilities, or personal property.
