#### § 541b. Boundaries of scenic-research area; adjustments to subarea boundaries; development of management plan; establishment of subareas; management objectives
##### (c) Subareas; establishment; management objectives

Within the Area, the following subareas shall be established and shall be managed in accord with the following primary management objectives which shall be supplemental to the general management objectives applicable to the entire Area:

(1) Estuary and Associated Wetlands Sub-area: An area managed to protect and perpetuate the fish and wildlife, scenic, and research-education values, while allowing dispersed recreation use, such as sport fishing, nonmotorized pleasure boating, waterfowl hunting, and other uses which the Secretary determines are compatible with the protection and perpetuation of the unique natural values of the subarea. After appropriate study, breaching of existing dikes may be permitted within the subarea.

(2) Lower Slope-Dispersed Residential Subarea: An area managed to maintain the scenic, soil and watershed, and fish and wildlife values, while allowing dispersed residential occupancy, selective recreation use, and agricultural use.

(3) Upper Timbered Slope and Headlands Subareas: Areas managed to protect the scenic, soil and watershed, and fish and wildlife values while allowing selective recreation and extensive research-educational activities. Timber harvesting activity may occur in these subareas only when the Secretary determines that such harvesting is to be conducted in connection with research activities or that the preservation of the timber resource is imminently threatened by fire, old age, infestation, or similar natural occurrences.

(4) Coastline and Sand Dune-Spit Subareas: Areas managed to protect and maintain the scenic and wildlife values while allowing selective recreation and extensive research-educational activities.
