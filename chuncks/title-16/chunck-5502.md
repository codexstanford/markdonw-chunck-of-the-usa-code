#### § 777c. Division of annual appropriations
##### (c) Apportionment among States

(1) The Secretary, after the distribution, transfer, use and deduction under subsection (b), and after deducting amounts used for activities under section 777m(e) of this title , shall apportion 58.012 percent of the balance of each such annual appropriation among the several States in the following manner: 40 percent in the ratio which the area of each State including coastal and Great Lakes waters (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) bears to the total area of all the States, and 60 percent in the ratio which the number of persons holding paid licenses to fish for sport or recreation in the State in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which such apportionment is made, as certified to said Secretary by the State fish and game departments, bears to the number of such persons in all the States. Such apportionments shall be adjusted equitably so that no State shall receive less than 1 percent nor more than 5 percent of the total amount apportioned. Where the apportionment to any State under this section is less than $4,500 annually, the Secretary of the Interior may allocate not more than $4,500 of said appropriation to said State to carry out the purposes of this chapter when said State certifies to the Secretary of the Interior that it has set aside not less than $1,500 from its fish-and-game funds or has made, through its legislature, an appropriation in this amount of said purposes.

(2) The Secretary shall deduct from the amount to be apportioned under paragraph (1) the amounts used for grants under section 777m(a) of this title .
