### CHAPTER 46— PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY POLICIES
#### § 2625. Special rules for standards
##### (a) Cost of service

In undertaking the consideration and making the determination under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard concerning cost of service established by section 2621(d)(1) of this title , the costs of providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be determined on the basis of methods prescribed by the State regulatory authority (in the case of a State regulated electric utility) or by the electric utility (in the case of a nonregulated electric utility). Such methods shall to the maximum extent practicable

(1) permit identification of differences in cost-incurrence, for each such class of electric consumers, attributable to daily and seasonal time of use of service and

(2) permit identification of differences in cost-incurrence attributable to differences in customer demand, and energy components of cost. In prescribing such methods, such State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility shall take into account the extent to which total costs to an electric utility are likely to change if

(A) additional capacity is added to meet peak demand relative to base demand; and

(B) additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy are delivered to electric consumers.
