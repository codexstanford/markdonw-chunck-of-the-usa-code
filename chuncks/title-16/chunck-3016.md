(A) Not later than ninety days after November 10, 1978 , the Secretary, after consultation with the Governor of the State of California, the California Coastal Commission, and the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission, shall commence acquisition of lands, improvements, waters, or interests therein within the recreation area. Such acquisition may be by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, transfer from any Federal agency, exchange, or otherwise. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any lands or interests therein owned by the State of California or any political subdivision thereof (including any park district or other public entity) may be acquired only by donation, except that such lands acquired after November 10, 1978 , by the State of California or its political subdivisions may be acquired by purchase or exchange if the Secretary determines that the lands were acquired for purposes which further the national interest in protecting the area and that the purchase price or value on exchange does not exceed fair market value on the date that the State acquired the land or interest: Provided, however , That the value of any lands acquired by the Secretary under the exception in this sentence shall be deducted from the amount of moneys available for grants to the State under subsection (n) of this section. Lands within the “Wildlife Corridor Expansion Zone” identified on the boundary map referred to in paragraph (1) may be acquired only by donation or with donated funds. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any Federal property located within the boundaries of the recreation area shall, with the concurrence of the head of the agency having custody thereof, be transferred without cost, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purposes of the recreation area.

(B) The Secretary shall negotiate, and carry out, and exchange with the city of Los Angeles (acting through its department of water and power) certain federally owned lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management in the vicinity of the Haiwee Reservoir in Inyo County for certain lands owned by the city of Los Angeles which are associated with the Upper Franklin Reservoir in the city of Los Angeles. Lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to such exchange shall be transferred without cost to the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service for inclusion within the recreation area. The Secretary shall include in such exchange a provision for an easement to be granted to the city of Los Angeles for the existing water pipeline associated with the Upper Franklin Reservoir and for the city of Los Angeles to provide for replacement water to maintain the water elevations of the Franklin Reservoir to the current levels. The values of lands exchanged under this provision shall be equal, or shall be equalized, in the same manner as provided in section 1716 of title 43 .

(C) The city shall assume full responsibility for the protection of cultural resources and shall develop a cultural resource management program for the public lands to be transferred to the city in the vicinity of the Haiwee Reservoir. The program shall be developed in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the California State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

(3) The Administrator of the General Services Administration is hereby authorized and directed to transfer the site generally known as Nike Site 78 to the Secretary for inclusion in the recreation area: Provided , That the county of Los Angeles shall be permitted to continue to use without charge the facilities together with sufficient land as in the determination of the Secretary shall be necessary to continue to maintain and operate a fire suppression and training facility and shall be excused from payment for any use of the land and facilities on the site prior to November 10, 1978 . At such time as the county of Los Angeles, California, relinquishes control of such facilities and adjacent land or ceases the operation of the fire suppression and training facility, the land and facilities shall be managed by the Secretary as a part of the recreation area.
