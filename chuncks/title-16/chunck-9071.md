### CHAPTER 67— AQUATIC NUISANCE PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 4722. Aquatic nuisance species program
##### (e) Control

(1) In general

The Task Force may develop cooperative efforts, within the program established under subsection (a), to control established aquatic nuisance species to minimize the risk of harm to the environment and the public health and welfare. For purposes of this chapter, control efforts include eradication of infestations, reductions of populations, development of means of adapting human activities and public facilities to accommodate infestations, and prevention of the spread of aquatic nuisance species from infested areas. Such control efforts shall be developed in consultation with affected Federal agencies, States, Indian Tribes, local governments, interjurisdictional organizations, and other appropriate entities. Control actions authorized by this section shall be based on the best available scientific information and shall be conducted in an environmentally sound manner.

(2) Decisions

The Task Force or any other affected agency or entity may recommend that the Task Force initiate a control effort. In determining whether a control program is warranted, the Task Force shall evaluate the need for control (including the projected consequences of no control and less than full control); the technical and biological feasibility and cost-effectiveness of alternative control strategies and actions; whether the benefits of control, including costs avoided, exceed the costs of the program; the risk of harm to non-target organisms and ecosystems, public health and welfare; and such other considerations the Task Force determines appropriate. The Task Force shall also determine the nature and extent of control of target aquatic nuisance species that is feasible and desirable.

(3) Programs

If the Task Force determines in accordance with paragraph (2) that control of an aquatic nuisance species is warranted, the Task Force shall develop a proposed control program to achieve the target level of control. A notice summarizing the proposed action and soliciting comments shall be published in the Federal Register, in major newspapers in the region affected, and in principal trade publications of the industries affected. Within 180 days of proposing a control program, and after consultation with affected governmental and other appropriate entities and taking into consideration other comments received, the Task Force shall complete development of the proposed control program.

(4) Technical assistance and recommendations

The Task Force may provide technical assistance and recommendations for best practices to an agency or entity engaged in vessel inspections or decontaminations for the purpose of

(A) effectively managing and controlling the movement of aquatic nuisance species into, within, or out of water of the United States; and

(B) inspecting recreational vessels in a manner that minimizes disruptions to public access for boating and recreation in non-contaminated vessels.

(5) Consultation and input

In carrying out paragraph (4), including the development of recommendations, the Task Force may consult with Indian Tribes and solicit input from

(A) State and Tribal fish and wildlife management agencies;

(B) other State and Tribal agencies that manage fishery resources of the State or sustain fishery habitat; and

(C) relevant nongovernmental entities.
