(6) establish standardized units of measurement, nomenclature, and formats for the collection and submission of information;

(7) minimize the paperwork required for vessels registered under the system;

(8) include all species of fish within the geographic areas of authority of the Councils and all fishing vessels including charter fishing vessels, but excluding recreational fishing vessels;

(9) require United States fish processors, and fish dealers and other first ex-vessel purchasers of fish that are subject to the proposed system, to submit information (other than economic information) which may be necessary to meet the goals of the proposed system; and

(10) include procedures necessary to ensure

(A) the confidentiality of information collected under this section in accordance with section 1881a(b) of this title ; and

(B) the timely release or availability to the public of information collected under this section consistent with section 1881a(b) of this title .
