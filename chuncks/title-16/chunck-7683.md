### CHAPTER 40— SOIL AND WATER RESOURCES CONSERVATION
#### § 2003. Congressional policy and declaration of purpose
##### (b) Full utilization of cooperative arrangements with State and tribal agencies

Recognizing that the arrangements under which the Federal Government cooperates with State and tribal soil and water conservation agencies and other appropriate State and tribal natural resource agencies such as those concerned with forestry and fish and wildlife and, through conservation districts, with other local units of government and land users, have effectively aided in the protection and improvement of the Nation’s basic resources, including the restoration and maintenance of resources damaged by improper use, it is declared to be the policy of the United States that these arrangements and similar cooperative arrangements should be utilized to the fullest extent practicable to achieve the purpose of this chapter consistent with the roles and responsibilities of the non-Federal agencies, landowners and land users.
