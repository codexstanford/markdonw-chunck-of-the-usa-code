### CHAPTER 31— MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION
#### § 1382. Regulations and administration
##### (e) Measures to alleviate impacts on strategic stocks

If the Secretary determines, based on a stock assessment under section 1386 of this title or other significant new information obtained under this chapter, that impacts on rookeries, mating grounds, or other areas of similar ecological significance to marine mammals may be causing the decline or impeding the recovery of a strategic stock, the Secretary may develop and implement conservation or management measures to alleviate those impacts. Such measures shall be developed and implemented after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and the appropriate Federal agencies and after notice and opportunity for public comment.
