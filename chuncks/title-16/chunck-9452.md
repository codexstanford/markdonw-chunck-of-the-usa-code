Priority shall be given to establishing programs under this section that address communities, environments, or industries that are in distress as a result of the decline or degradation of coral reef ecosystems, including

(2) the development of monitoring or management options for communities or industries that are experiencing significant financial hardship;

(3) the development of adaptation options to alleviate economic harm and job loss caused by damage to coral reef ecosystems;

(4) the development of measures to help vulnerable communities or industries, with an emphasis on rural communities and businesses; and

(5) the development of adaptation and management options for impacted tourism industries.
