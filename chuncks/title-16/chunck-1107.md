In order to carry out the purposes expressed in section 410qq(b) of this title , the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “Secretary”) shall establish the National Park of American Samoa (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the “park”). The Secretary shall establish the park only when the Governor of American Samoa has entered into a lease with the Secretary under which the Secretary will lease for a period of 50 years the lands and waters generally referred to in subsection (b) for use solely for purposes of the park. Immediately after October 31, 1988 , the Secretary shall commence negotiations with the Governor of American Samoa respecting such a lease agreement. On or before the expiration of the lease agreement as set forth in this subsection, the Governor of American Samoa is encouraged to extend the lease to maintain the area as a unit of the National Park System. At such time as the lease may terminate the Government of American Samoa is urged to provide assurances to the Secretary that the lands and waters generally referred to in subsection (b) will be protected and preserved to the same standards as are applicable to national parks.
