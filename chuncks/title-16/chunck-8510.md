(B) set aside, diverted or otherwise not cultivated under a program administered by the Secretary for any such crops to reduce production of an agricultural commodity.

(2) Eligibility based on compliance with conservation plan.

(A) In general .

If, as of January 1, 1990 , or 2 years after the Soil Conservation Service has completed a soil survey for the farm, whichever is later, a person is actively applying a conservation plan, such person shall have until January 1, 1995 , to comply with the plan without being subject to program ineligibility.

(B) Minimization of documentation .

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary, Soil Conservation Service, and local soil conservation districts shall minimize the quantity of documentation a person must submit to comply with this paragraph.

(C) Crop insurance.

(i) Operations new to compliance .

Notwithstanding section 3811(a) of this title , in the case of a person that is subject to section 3811 of this title for the first time solely due to the amendment made by section 2611(a) of the Agricultural Act of 2014, any person who produces an agricultural commodity on the land that is the basis of the payments described in section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title shall have 5 reinsurance years after the date on which such payments become subject to section 3811 of this title to develop and comply with an approved conservation plan so as to maintain eligibility for such payments.

(ii) Existing operations with prior violations .

Notwithstanding section 3811(a) of this title , in the case of a person that the Secretary determines would have been in violation of section 3811(a) of this title if the person had continued participation in the programs requiring compliance at any time after February 7, 2014 , and is currently in violation of section 3811(a) of this title , the person shall have 2 reinsurance years after the date on which the payments described in section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title become subject to section 3811 of this title to develop and comply with an approved conservation plan, as determined by the Secretary, so as to maintain eligibility for such payments.

(iii) Applicable reinsurance year .

Ineligibility for the payment described in section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title for a violation under this subparagraph during a crop year shall

(I) only apply to reinsurance years subsequent to the date of a final determination of a violation, including all administrative appeals; and

(II) not apply to the existing reinsurance year or any reinsurance year prior to the date of the final determination.

(3) Any person who owns or operates highly erodible land that was the subject of a contract entered into under subpart B of part I of subchapter IV shall only be required to apply a conservation plan established under this subchapter. The person shall not be required to meet a higher conservation standard than the standard applied to other highly erodible cropland located within the same area. If the person’s conservation plan requires structures to be constructed, the person shall have until 2 years after the expiration of such contract to comply with the conservation plan, or a longer period of time if the Secretary determines compliance is otherwise technically or economically not feasible, or such longer period is otherwise appropriate, before such person will be subject to program ineligibility with respect to such land under section 3811 of this title .

(4) On the expiration of a contract entered into under subpart B of part I of subchapter IV, the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the acreage that was the subject of such contract.
