### CHAPTER 51— ALASKA NATIONAL INTEREST LANDS CONSERVATION
#### § 3181. Alaska Land Use Council
##### (j) Cooperative planning

(1) The Council shall recommend cooperative planning zones, consisting of areas of the State in which the management of lands or resources by one member materially affects the management of lands or resources of another member or members including, but not limited to, such areas as the Northwest Arctic, the North Slope, and Bristol Bay. Federal members of the Council are authorized and encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements with Federal agencies, with State and local agencies, and with Native Corporations providing for mutual consultation, review, and coordination of resource management plans and programs within such zones.

(2) With respect to lands, waters, and interests therein which are subject to a cooperative agreement in accordance with this subsection, the Secretary, in addition to any requirement of applicable law, may provide technical and other assistance to the landowner with respect to fire control, trespass control, law enforcement, resource use, and planning. Such assistance may be provided without reimbursement if the Secretary determines that to do so would further the purposes of the cooperative agreement and would be in the public interest.

(3) Cooperative agreements established pursuant to this section shall include a plan for public participation consistent with the guidelines established by the Council pursuant to subsection (m).
