##### (a) Improved property on National Park System lands

(1) On public lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System created or enlarged by this Act, cabins or other structures existing prior to December 18, 1973 , may be occupied and used by the claimant to these structures pursuant to a renewable, nontransferable permit. Such use and occupancy shall be for terms of five years each: Provided , That the claimant of the structure by application:

(A) Reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale or other documentation, proof of possessory interest or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;

(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;

(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin and to remove all personal property from the cabin or structure upon expiration of the permit; and

(D) Acknowledges in the permit that the applicant has no interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located.

(2) On public lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System created or enlarged by this Act, cabins or other structures, the occupancy or use of which commenced between December 18, 1973 , and December 1, 1978 , may be used and occupied by the claimant of such structure pursuant to a nontransferable, nonrenewable permit. Such use and occupancy shall be for a maximum term of one year: Provided, however , That the claimant, by application:

(A) Reasonably demonstrates by affidavit, bill of sale, or other documentation proof of possessory interest or right of occupancy in the cabin or structure;

(B) Submits a sketch or photograph of the cabin or structure and a map showing its geographic location;

(C) Agrees to vacate the cabin or structure and to remove all personal property from it upon expiration of the permit; and

(D) Acknowledges in the permit that the applicant has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin or structure is located. The Secretary may, on a case by case basis, subject to reasonable regulations, extend such permit term beyond one year for such reasons as the Secretary deems equitable and just.

(3) Cabins or other structures not under permit as specified herein shall be used only for official government business: Provided however , That during emergencies involving the safety of human life or where designated for public use by the Secretary, these cabins may be used by the general public.

(4) The Secretary may issue a permit under such conditions as he may prescribe for the temporary use, occupancy, construction and maintenance of new cabins or other structures if he determines that the use is necessary to reasonably accommodate subsistence uses or is otherwise authorized by law.
