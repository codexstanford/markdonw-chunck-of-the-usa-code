#### § 6232. Fees for occupancy and use of National Forest System lands and facilities by organizational camps
##### (a) Land use fee

(1) Percentage of land value

The Secretary shall charge an annual land use fee for each organizational camp for its occupancy and use of National Forest System lands equal to 5 percent of the product of the following:

(A) The total number of acres of National Forest System lands authorized for the organizational camp.

(B) The estimated per-acre market value of land and buildings in the county where the camp is located, as reported in the most recent Census of Agriculture conducted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service.

(2) Annual adjustment

The land use fee determined under paragraph (1) for an organizational camp shall be adjusted annually by the annual compounded rate of change between the two most recent Censuses of Agriculture.

(3) Reduction in fees

(A) Type of participants

The Secretary shall reduce the land use fee determined under paragraph (1) proportionate to the number of individuals with a disability and children at risk who annually attend the organizational camp.

(B) Type of programs

After making the reduction required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce the remaining land use fee amount by up to 60 percent, proportionate to the number of persons who annually attend the organizational camp who participate in youth programs through organized and supervised social, citizenship, character-building, or faith-based activities oriented to outdoor-recreation experiences.

(C) Relation to minimum fee

The reductions made under this paragraph may not reduce the land use fee for an organizational camp below the minimum land use fee required to be charged under paragraph (4).

(D) Special considerations

For purposes of determining the amount of the land use fee reduction required under subparagraph (A) or (B), the Secretary may not take into consideration the existence of sponsorships or scholarships to assist persons in attending the organizational camp.

(4) Minimum land use fee

The Secretary shall charge a minimum land use fee under paragraph (1) that represents, on average, the Secretary’s cost annually to administer an organizational camp special use authorization in the National Forest Region in which the organizational camp is located. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) or subsection (d), the minimum land use fee shall not be subject to a reduction or waiver.
