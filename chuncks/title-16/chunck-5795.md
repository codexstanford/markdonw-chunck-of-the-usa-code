### CHAPTER 12— FEDERAL REGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF POWER
#### § 824q. Native load service obligation
##### (c) Allocation of transmission rights

Nothing in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section shall affect any existing or future methodology employed by a Transmission Organization for allocating or auctioning transmission rights if such Transmission Organization was authorized by the Commission to allocate or auction financial transmission rights on its system as of January 1, 2005 , and the Commission determines that any future allocation or auction is just, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, provided, however, that if such a Transmission Organization never allocated financial transmission rights on its system that pertained to a period before January 1, 2005 , with respect to any application by such Transmission Organization that would change its methodology the Commission shall exercise its authority in a manner consistent with the  1 chapter and that takes into account the policies expressed in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) as applied to firm transmission rights held by a load-serving entity as of January 1, 2005 , to the extent the associated generation ownership or power purchase arrangements remain in effect.
