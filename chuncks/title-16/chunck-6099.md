### CHAPTER 12H— PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER PLANNING AND CONSERVATION
#### § 839b. Regional planning and participation
##### (d) Regional conservation and electric power plan

(1) Within two years after the Council is established and the members are appointed pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the Council shall prepare, adopt, and promptly transmit to the Administrator a regional conservation and electric power plan. The adopted plan, or any portion thereof, may be amended from time to time, and shall be reviewed by the Council not less frequently than once every five years. Prior to such adoption, public hearings shall be held in each Council member’s State on the plan or substantial, nontechnical amendments to the plan proposed by the Council for adoption. A public hearing shall also be held in any other State of the region on the plan or amendments thereto, if the Council determines that the plan or amendments would likely have a substantial impact on that State in terms of major resources which may be developed in that State and which the Administrator may seek to acquire. Action of the Council under this subsection concerning such hearings shall be subject to section 553 of title 5 and such procedure as the Council shall adopt.

(2) Following adoption of the plan and any amendment thereto, all actions of the Administrator pursuant to section 839d of this title shall be consistent with the plan and any amendment thereto, except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter.
