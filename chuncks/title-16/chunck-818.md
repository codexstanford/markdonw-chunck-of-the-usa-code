#### § 410r–8. Modification of certain water projects
##### (d) Flood protection; adjacent agricultural area

(1) If the Secretary of the Army determines pursuant to subsection (b) that an adjacent agricultural area will be adversely affected, the Secretary of the Army is authorized and directed to construct a flood protection system for such area. Such determination shall be based on a finding by the Secretary of the Army that:

(A) the adverse effect will be attributable solely to a project modification authorized in subsection (a) or to a flood protection system implemented pursuant to subsection (c), or both; and

(B) such modification or flood protection system will result in a substantial reduction in the economic utility of such area based on its present agricultural use.

(2) No project modification authorized in subsection (a) which the Secretary of the Army determines will cause an adverse effect pursuant to subsection (b) shall be made operational until the Secretary of the Army has implemented measures to prevent such adverse effect on the adjacent agricultural area: Provided , That the Secretary of the Army or the South Florida Water Management District may operate the modification to the extent that the Secretary of the Army determines that such operation will not adversely affect the adjacent agricultural area: Provided further , That any preventive measure shall be implemented in a manner that presents the least prospect of harm to the natural resources of the park.

(3) Any flood protection system implemented by the Secretary of the Army pursuant to this subsection shall be required only to provide for flood protection for present agricultural uses within such adjacent agricultural area.

(4) The acquisition of land authorized in section 410r–6 of this title shall not be considered a project modification.
