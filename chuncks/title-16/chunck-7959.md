##### (b) Time-of-day rates

In undertaking the consideration and making the determination required under section 2621 of this title with respect to the standard for time-of-day rates established by section 2621(d)(3) of this title and the standard for time-based metering and communications established by section 2621(d)(14) of this title , a time-of-day rate charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be determined to be cost-effective with respect to each such class if the long-run benefits of such rate to the electric utility and its electric consumers in the class concerned are likely to exceed the metering and communications costs and other costs associated with the use of such rates.
