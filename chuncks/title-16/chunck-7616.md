#### § 1868. Herring study
##### (a) In general

The Secretary may conduct a cooperative research program to study the issues of abundance, distribution and the role of herring as forage fish for other commercially important fish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, and the potential for local scale depletion from herring harvesting and how it relates to other fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic.
