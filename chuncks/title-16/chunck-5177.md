#### § 698n. Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve
##### (b) Land acquisition

The Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter in sections 698n to 698p of this title referred to as the “Secretary”) is authorized to acquire lands and interests therein within the Preserve by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange, but no lands other than wetlands or interests therein may be acquired without the consent of the owner. For purposes of this subsection, the term “wetlands” has the same meaning as provided by section 3902 of this title . Lands, interests in lands, and improvements thereon within the boundaries of the Preserve which are owned by the State of Florida or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation or exchange. On lands acquired for inclusion within the Preserve, the Secretary shall not impair any legal riparian right of access nor shall he preclude the continued use of any legal right of way.
