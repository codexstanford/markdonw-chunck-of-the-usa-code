#### § 460x–11. Scenic roads
##### (e) Manner of acquiring fee title or lesser interest in land

(1) Except as provided under paragraph (4), the Secretary may obtain fee title or other lesser interests to lands described in subsection (c) only

(A) by gift, donation, or bequest;

(B) by purchase from a willing seller under paragraph (2); or

(C) as an exercise of a right of first refusal under paragraph (3).

(2) The Secretary may negotiate with willing sellers for the transfer of fee title to other lesser interests to lands described in subsection (c). If the Secretary and such willing seller are unable to agree to a fair purchase price, that question may, by mutual consent be submitted to the appropriate United States District Court for adjudication.

(3) If the owner of any lands described in subsection (c) intends to transfer any interest in such lands except by gift, donation, or bequest, such owner must notify the Secretary of such intention. The Secretary shall have 90 days after notification in which to exercise a right of first refusal to match any bona fide offer to obtain such interest under the same terms and conditions as are contained in such offer. If the Secretary has not exercised such right within 90 days, the owner may transfer such interest.

(4) Condemnation may be used with respect to any lands described in subsection (c) only

(A) to clear title if necessary for any transfer to the Secretary under this subsection; or

(B) to purchase fee title or such lesser interest as may be sufficient to prevent significant damage to the scenic, soil, or water resources of the lakeshore. Action under this subparagraph shall be used only after attempts to negotiate a solution to the problem have failed. If the Secretary determines that such attempts have failed, the Secretary shall notify in writing the owner of the property involved of the proposed action to be taken under this subparagraph and the Secretary shall seek an injunction to prevent such resource damage. The Secretary may at any time, and if an injunction is granted under this subparagraph the Secretary shall within 30 days after the date of such injunction, send in writing to the owner of the property the Secretary’s best and final offer for the purchase of such property. If the owner does not accept such offer, the Secretary may file for condemnation. The Secretary must notify the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives of any action taken under this subparagraph.
