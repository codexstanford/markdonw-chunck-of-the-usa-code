#### § 497c. Ski area permit rental charge
##### (b) Formula

(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be calculated by adding the permittee’s gross revenues from lift ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically located on national forest land, including all permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue bracket:

(A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below $3,000,000;

(B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;

(C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and

(D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue that exceeds $50,000,000. Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection the ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply illustrated as: SAPF = ((LT + SS) × STFP) + GRAF = AGR; AGR × % BRACKETS

(2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on national forest land referred to in this subsection shall be calculated as generally described in the Forest Service Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992 . Revenues from Nordic ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental charge calculation according to the percentage of trails physically located on national forest land.

(3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair and equitable to both the United States and the ski area permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually by the percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 3 years after November 12, 1996 , and every 5 years thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area permit rental charge required by this section is returning a fair market value rental to the United States together with any recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications of the system.
