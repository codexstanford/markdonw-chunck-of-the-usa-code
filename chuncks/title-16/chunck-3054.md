#### § 460mm–3. Rights of holders of unperfected mining claims
##### (d) Validity determination

If an application for a patent is filed by the holder of an unperfected mining claim pursuant to subsection (c) or if a contest proceeding is initiated by the United States after September 30, 1982 , the validity of each claim shall be determined as of the date of the patent application or September 30, 1982 , whichever is earlier. the holder of an unperfected mining claim not subject to a patent application filed prior to September 30, 1982 , shall submit to the Secretary within one hundred and eighty days after such date all mineral data compiled during the contest proceeding moratorium which would support a valid mineral discovery within the meaning of the mining laws of the United States. Failure to submit such data within the one-hundred-and-eighty-day period shall preclude its consideration in a subsequent determination of the validity of each affected claim. Except as specifically provided for in this section, nothing shall alter the criteria applied under the general mining laws of the United States to adjudicate the validity of unperfected mining claims.
