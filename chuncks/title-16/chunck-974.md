#### § 410ff–1. Acquisition of property
##### (d) Retention of rights by owners; compatible use under lease

(1) The owner of any private property may, on the date of its acquisition and as a condition of such acquisition, retain for himself a right of use and occupancy of all or such portion of such property as the owner may elect for a definite term of not more than twenty-five years, or ending at the death of the owner, or his spouse, whichever is later. The owner shall elect the term to be reserved. Any such right retained pursuant to this subsection with respect to any property shall be subject to termination by the Secretary upon his determination that such property is being used for any purpose which is incompatible with the administration of the park or with the preservation of the resources therein, and it shall terminate by operation of law upon notification by the Secretary to the holder of the right, of such determination and tendering to him the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired.

(2) In the case of any property acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter with respect to which a right of use and occupancy was not reserved by the former owner pursuant to this subsection, at the request of the former owner, the Secretary may enter into a lease agreement with the former owner under which the former owner may continue any existing use of such property which is compatible with the administration of the park and with the preservation of the resources therein.

(3) Any right retained pursuant to this subsection, and any lease entered into under paragraph (2), shall be subject to such access and other provisions as may be required by the Secretary for visitor use and resources management.
