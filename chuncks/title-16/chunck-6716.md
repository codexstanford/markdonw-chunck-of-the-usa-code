#### § 1379. Transfer of management authority
##### (f) Transfer of management authority to State of Alaska

(1) The Secretary may not transfer management authority to the State of Alaska under subsection (b)(1) for any species of marine mammal unless

(A) the State has adopted and will implement a statute and regulations that insure that the taking of the species for subsistence uses

(i) is accomplished in a nonwasteful manner,

(ii) will be the priority consumptive use of the species, and

(iii) if required to be restricted, such restriction will be based upon

(I) the customary and direct dependence upon the species as the mainstay of livelihood,

(II) local residency, and

(III) the availability of alternative resources; and

(B) the State has adopted a statute or regulation that requires that any consumptive use of marine mammal species, other than for subsistence uses, will be authorized during a regulatory year only if the appropriate agency first makes findings, based on an administrative record before it, that

(i) such use will have no significant adverse impact upon subsistence uses of the species, and

(ii) the regulation of such use, including, but not limited to, licensing of marine mammal hunting guides and the assignment of guiding areas, will, to the maximum extent practicable, provide economic opportunities for the residents of the rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of that species.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “subsistence uses” means the customary and traditional uses by rural Alaska residents of marine mammals for direct personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation; for the making and selling of handicraft articles out of nonedible byproducts of marine mammals taken for personal or family consumption; and for barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption. As used in this paragraph

(A) The term “family” means all persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption, or any person living within a household on a permanent basis.

(B) The term “barter” means the exchange of marine mammals or their parts, taken for subsistence uses

(i) for other wildlife or fish or their parts, or

(ii) for other food or for nonedible items other than money if the exchange is of a limited and noncommercial nature.
