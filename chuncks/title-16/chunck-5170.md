#### § 698m–4. Oil and gas exploration, development, and production in Big Cypress National Preserve and Addition
##### (b) Contents of rule or regulation; permit from National Park Service

Any rule or regulation promulgated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section shall provide that

(1) exploration or development and production activities may not be undertaken, except pursuant to a permit issued by the National Park Service authorizing such activities or access; and

(2) final action by the National Park Service with respect to any application for a permit authorizing such activities shall occur within 90 days from the date such an application is submitted unless

(A) the National Park Service and the applicant agree that such final action shall occur within a shorter or longer period of time; or

(B) the National Park Service determines that an additional period of time is required to ensure that the National Park Service has, in reviewing the application, complied with other applicable law, Executive orders and regulations; or

(C) the National Park Service, within 30 days from the date of submission of such application, notifies the applicant that such application does not contain all information reasonably necessary to allow the National Park Service to consider such application and requests that such additional information be provided. After receipt of such notification to the applicant, the applicant shall supply any reasonably necessary additional information and shall advise the National Park Service that the applicant believes that the application contains all reasonably necessary information and is therefore complete, whereupon the National Park Service may

(i) within 30 days of receipt of such notice from the applicant to the National Park Service determine that the application does not contain all reasonably necessary additional information and, on that basis, deny the application; or

(ii) review the application and take final action within 60 days from the date that the applicant provides notification to the National Park Service that its application is complete.
