### CHAPTER 51— ALASKA NATIONAL INTEREST LANDS CONSERVATION
#### § 3148. Oil and gas leasing program for non-North Slope Federal lands
##### (a) Establishment; restrictions

The Secretary shall establish, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended [ 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], an oil and gas leasing program on the Federal lands of Alaska not subject to the study required by section 3141 of this title , other than lands included in the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska. Such program shall not be undertaken by the Secretary on those lands where applicable law prohibits such leasing or on those units of the National Wildlife Refuge System where the Secretary determines, after having considered the national interest in producing oil and gas from such lands, that the exploration for and development of oil or gas would be incompatible with the purpose for which such unit was established.
