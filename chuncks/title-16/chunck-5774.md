Not later than one year after December 4, 2015 , the Commission, after consultation with the Secretary, shall promulgate such regulations as necessary to

(A) establish criteria and procedures to designate information as critical electric infrastructure information;

(B) prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of critical electric infrastructure information;

(C) ensure there are appropriate sanctions in place for Commissioners, officers, employees, or agents of the Commission or the Department of Energy who knowingly and willfully disclose critical electric infrastructure information in a manner that is not authorized under this section; and

(i) Federal, State, political subdivision, and tribal authorities;

(ii) the Electric Reliability Organization;

(iii) regional entities;

(iv) information sharing and analysis centers established pursuant to Presidential Decision Directive 63;

(vi) other entities determined appropriate by the Commission.

(3) Authority to designate

Information may be designated by the Commission or the Secretary as critical electric infrastructure information pursuant to the criteria and procedures established by the Commission under paragraph (2)(A).

(4) Considerations

In exercising their respective authorities under this subsection, the Commission and the Secretary shall take into consideration the role of State commissions in reviewing the prudence and cost of investments, determining the rates and terms of conditions for electric services, and ensuring the safety and reliability of the bulk-power system and distribution facilities within their respective jurisdictions.

(5) Protocols

The Commission and the Secretary shall, in consultation with Canadian and Mexican authorities, develop protocols for the voluntary sharing of critical electric infrastructure information with Canadian and Mexican authorities and owners, operators, and users of the bulk-power system outside the United States.

(6) No required sharing of information

Nothing in this section shall require a person or entity in possession of critical electric infrastructure information to share such information with Federal, State, political subdivision, or tribal authorities, or any other person or entity.

(7) Submission of information to Congress

Nothing in this section shall permit or authorize the withholding of information from Congress, any committee or subcommittee thereof, or the Comptroller General.

(8) Disclosure of nonprotected information

In implementing this section, the Commission and the Secretary shall segregate critical electric infrastructure information or information that reasonably could be expected to lead to the disclosure of the critical electric infrastructure information within documents and electronic communications, wherever feasible, to facilitate disclosure of information that is not designated as critical electric infrastructure information.

(9) Duration of designation

Information may not be designated as critical electric infrastructure information for longer than 5 years, unless specifically re-designated by the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate.

(10) Removal of designation

The Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, shall remove the designation of critical electric infrastructure information, in whole or in part, from a document or electronic communication if the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, determines that the unauthorized disclosure of such information could no longer be used to impair the security or reliability of the bulk-power system or distribution facilities.

(11) Judicial review of designations

Notwithstanding section 825 l (b) of this title, with respect to a petition filed by a person to which an order under this section applies, any determination by the Commission or the Secretary concerning the designation of critical electric infrastructure information under this subsection shall be subject to review under chapter 7 of title 5, except that such review shall be brought in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in the District of Columbia. In such a case the court shall examine in camera the contents of documents or electronic communications that are the subject of the determination under review to determine whether such documents or any part thereof were improperly designated or not designated as critical electric infrastructure information.
