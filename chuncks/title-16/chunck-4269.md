#### § 539k. Kelly Butte Special Management Area
##### (c) No buffer zones

Congress does not intend that the designation of the Kelly Butte Special Management Area lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the Area. The fact that non-compatible activities or uses can be seen or heard from within the Kelly Butte Special Management Area shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the Area.
