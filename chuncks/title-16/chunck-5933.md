#### § 831m–1. Tennessee Valley Authority least-cost planning program
##### (b) Conduct of program

(1) In general

In conducting a least-cost planning program under subsection (a), the Tennessee Valley Authority shall employ and implement a planning and selection process for new energy resources which evaluates the full range of existing and incremental resources (including new power supplies, energy conservation and efficiency, and renewable energy resources) in order to provide adequate and reliable service to electric customers of the Tennessee Valley Authority at the lowest system cost.

(2) Planning and selection process

The planning and selection process referred to in paragraph (1) shall

(A) take into account necessary features for system operation, including diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk;

(B) take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; and

(C) treat demand and supply resources on a consistent and integrated basis.

(3) “System cost” defined

As used in paragraph (1), the term “system cost” means all direct and quantifiable net costs for an energy resource over its available life, including the cost of production, transportation, utilization, waste management, environmental compliance, and, in the case of imported energy resources, maintaining access to foreign sources of supply.
