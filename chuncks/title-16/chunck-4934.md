##### (b) Establishment

(1) In general

The Secretaries shall establish within the United States Fish and Wildlife Service a task force, to be known as the “Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force” (referred to in this subsection as the “Task Force”) after the completion of the study required by subsection (c).

(ii) the prioritization and coordination of the future study of chronic wasting disease, based on evolving research needs;

(iii) ways to leverage the collective resources of Federal, State, and local agencies, Indian Tribes, and foreign governments, and resources from private, nongovernmental entities, to address chronic wasting disease in the United States and along the borders of the United States; and

(iv) any other area where containment or management efforts relating to chronic wasting disease may differ across jurisdictions; and
