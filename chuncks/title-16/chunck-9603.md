#### § 6592. Wildfire risk reduction
##### (g) Priorities

In carrying out projects using amounts made available under this section, the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, as applicable, shall prioritize funding for projects

(1) for which any applicable processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) have been completed on November 15, 2021 ;

(2) that reduce the likelihood of experiencing uncharacteristically severe effects from a potential wildfire by focusing on areas strategically important for reducing the risks associated with wildfires;

(3) that maximize the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fire-resilient stands;

(4) that do not include the establishment of permanent roads;

(5) for which funding would be committed to decommission all temporary roads constructed to carry out the project; and

(6) that fully maintain or contribute toward the restoration of the structure and composition of old growth stands consistent with the characteristics of that forest type, taking into account the contribution of the old growth stand to landscape fire adaption and watershed health, unless the old growth stand is part of a science-based ecological restoration project authorized by the Secretary concerned that meets applicable protection and old growth enhancement objectives, as determined by the Secretary concerned.
