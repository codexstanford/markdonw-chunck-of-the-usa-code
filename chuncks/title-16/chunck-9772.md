### CHAPTER 89— PACIFIC WHITING
#### § 7007. Rulemaking
##### (a) Application with Magnuson-Stevens Act

The Secretary shall establish the United States catch level for Pacific whiting according to the standards and procedures of the Agreement and this chapter rather than under the standards and procedures of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act ( 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), except to the extent necessary to address the rebuilding needs of other species. Except for establishing the catch level, all other aspects of Pacific whiting management shall be

(1) subject to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; and

(2) consistent with this chapter.
