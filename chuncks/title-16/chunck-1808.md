#### § 423l–4. Land acquisition
##### (b) Easements

(1) Outside boundaries

The Secretary may acquire an easement on property outside the boundaries of the battlefield park and around the City of Richmond, with the consent of the owner, if the Secretary determines that the easement is necessary to protect core Civil War resources as identified by the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee. Upon acquisition of the easement, the Secretary shall revise the boundaries of the battlefield park to include the property subject to the easement.

(2) Inside boundaries

To the extent practicable, and if preferred by a willing landowner, the Secretary shall use permanent conservation easements to acquire interests in land in lieu of acquiring land in fee simple and thereby removing land from non-Federal ownership.
