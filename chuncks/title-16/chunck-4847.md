#### § 620b. Limitations on substitution of unprocessed Federal timber for unprocessed timber exported from private lands
##### (b) Indirect substitution

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person may, beginning 21 days after August 20, 1990 , purchase from any other person unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States if such person would be prohibited from purchasing such timber directly from a department or agency of the United States. Acquisitions of western red cedar which are domestically processed into finished products to be sold into domestic or international markets are exempt from the prohibition contained in this paragraph.

(2) Exceptions

(A) The Secretary of Agriculture shall, as soon as practicable but not later than 9 months after August 20, 1990 , establish, by rule, a limited amount of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands described in subparagraph (B) which may be purchased by a person otherwise covered by the prohibition contained in paragraph (1). Such limit shall equal

(i) the amount of such timber acquired by such person, based on the higher of the applicant’s actual timber purchasing receipts or the appropriate Federal agency’s records, during fiscal years 1988, 1989, and 1990, divided by 3, or

(ii) 15 million board feet, whichever is less, except that such limit shall not exceed such person’s proportionate share, with respect to all persons covered under this paragraph, of 50 million board feet.

(B) The Federal lands referred to in subparagraph (A) are Federal lands administered by the United States Forest Service Region 6 that are located north of the Columbia River from its mouth and east to its first intersection with the 119th meridian, and from that point north of the 46th parallel and east.

(C) Any person may sell, trade, or otherwise exchange with any other person the rights obtained under subparagraph (A), except that such rights may not be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged to persons already in possession of such rights obtained under subparagraph (A).

(D) Federal timber purchased from Federal lands described in subparagraph (B) pursuant to a contract entered into between the purchaser and the Secretary of Agriculture before the date on which regulations to carry out this subsection are issued under section 620f of this title shall be governed by the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture in effect before such date that restrict the substitution of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands for exported timber originating from private lands.
