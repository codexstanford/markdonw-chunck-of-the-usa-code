### CHAPTER 69— WILD EXOTIC BIRD CONSERVATION
#### § 4905. List of approved species
##### (c) Non-captive bred species

The Secretary shall include in the list under subsection (a) a species of exotic birds that is listed in an Appendix to the Convention if the Secretary finds the Convention is being effectively implemented with respect to that species because of each of the following:

(1) Each country of origin for which the species is listed is effectively implementing the Convention, particularly with respect to

(A) the establishment of a scientific authority or other equivalent authority;

(B) the requirements of Article IV of the Convention with respect to that species; and

(C) remedial measures recommended by the Parties to the Convention with respect to that species.

(2) A scientifically-based management plan for the species has been developed which

(A) provides for the conservation of the species and its habitat and includes incentives for conservation;

(B) ensures that the use of the species is biologically sustainable and maintained throughout the range of the species in the country to which the plan applies at a level that is consistent with the role of the species in the ecosystem and is well above the level at which the species might become threatened with extinction; and

(C) addresses factors relevant to the conservation of the species, including illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, disease, and habitat loss.

(3) The management plan is implemented and enforced.

(4) The methods of capture, transport, and maintenance of the species minimizes the risk of injury or damage to health, including inhumane treatment.
