#### § 824p. Siting of interstate electric transmission facilities
##### (a) Designation of national interest electric transmission corridors

(1) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005 , and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”), in consultation with affected States and Indian Tribes, shall conduct a study of electric transmission capacity constraints and congestion.

(2) Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the Secretary, after considering alternatives and recommendations from interested parties (including an opportunity for comment from affected States and Indian Tribes), shall issue a report, based on the study under paragraph (1) or other information relating to electric transmission capacity constraints and congestion, which may designate as a national interest electric transmission corridor any geographic area that

(i) 1 is experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers; or

(ii) 2 is expected to experience such energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion.

(3) Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the Secretary, in conducting the study under paragraph (1) and issuing the report under paragraph (2), shall consult with any appropriate regional entity referred to in section 824 o of this title.

(4) In determining whether to designate a national interest electric transmission corridor under paragraph (2), the Secretary may consider whether

(A) the economic vitality and development of the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be constrained by lack of adequate or reasonably priced electricity;

(B)

(i) economic growth in the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be jeopardized by reliance on limited sources of energy; and

(ii) a diversification of supply is warranted;

(C) the energy independence or energy security of the United States would be served by the designation;

(D) the designation would be in the interest of national energy policy;

(E) the designation would enhance national defense and homeland security;

(F) the designation would enhance the ability of facilities that generate or transmit firm or intermittent energy to connect to the electric grid;

(G) the designation

(i) maximizes existing rights-of-way; and

(ii) avoids and minimizes, to the maximum extent practicable, and offsets to the extent appropriate and practicable, sensitive environmental areas and cultural heritage sites; and

(H) the designation would result in a reduction in the cost to purchase electric energy for consumers.
