In order to implement this section and in furtherance of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1996 , 1996a], the Secretary, upon the request of an appropriate Indian tribe, may from time to time temporarily close to general public use one or more specific portions of the monument or the conservation area in order to protect the privacy of religious activities in such areas by Indian people.
