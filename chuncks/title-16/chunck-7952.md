Not later than two years after November 9, 1978 , each State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority), and each nonregulated electric utility, shall provide public notice and conduct a hearing respecting the standards established by subsection (b) and, on the basis of such hearing, shall

(1) adopt the standards established by subsection (b) (other than paragraph (4) thereof) if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated electric utility determines that such adoption is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, is otherwise appropriate, and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law, and

(2) adopt the standard established by subsection (b)(4) if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated electric utility determines that such adoption is appropriate and consistent with otherwise applicable State law. For purposes of any determination under paragraphs (1) or (2) and any review of such determination in any court in accordance with section 2633 of this title , the purposes of this chapter supplement otherwise applicable State law. Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to adopt any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law.
