(2) Prohibitions on limitations

Notwithstanding any provision of State law, no conservation easement held by the United States or its successors or assigns under this section shall be limited in duration or scope or be defeasible by

(A) the conservation easement being in gross or appurtenant;

(B) the management of the conservation easement having been delegated or assigned to a non-Federal entity;

(C) any requirement under State law for re-recordation or renewal of the easement; or

(D) any future disestablishment of a Forest Legacy Program area or other Federal project for which the conservation easement was originally acquired.
