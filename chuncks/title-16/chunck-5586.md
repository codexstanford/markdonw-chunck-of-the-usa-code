(A) The contract covers one or more projects for which a license was issued by the Commission before January 1, 1985 .

(B) The contract contains provisions specifically providing each of the following:

(i) A powerplant may be built by the licensee utilizing irrigation facilities constructed by the United States.

(ii) The powerplant shall remain in the exclusive control, possession, and ownership of the licensee concerned.

(iii) All revenue from the powerplant and from the use, sale, or disposal of electric energy from the powerplant shall be, and remain, the property of such licensee.

This paragraph shall apply to any project covered by a contract referred to in this paragraph only during the term of such contract unless otherwise provided by subsequent Act of Congress. In the event an overpayment of any charge due under this section shall be made by a licensee, the Commission is authorized to allow a credit for such overpayment when charges are due for any subsequent period.

(2) In the case of licenses involving the use of Government dams or other structures owned by the United States, the charges fixed (or readjusted) by the Commission under paragraph (1) for the use of such dams or structures shall not exceed 1 mill per kilowatt-hour for the first 40 gigawatt-hours of energy a project produces in any year, 1½ mills per kilowatt-hour for over 40 up to and including 80 gigawatt-hours in any year, and 2 mills per kilowatt-hour for any energy the project produces over 80 gigawatt-hours in any year. Except as provided in subsection (f), such charge shall be the only charge assessed by any agency of the United States for the use of such dams or structures.

(3) The provisions of paragraph (2) shall apply with respect to

(A) all licenses issued after October 16, 1986 ; and

(B) all licenses issued before October 16, 1986 , which
