#### § 824p. Siting of interstate electric transmission facilities
##### (b) Construction permit

Except as provided in subsection (i), the Commission may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue one or more permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) if the Commission finds that

(1)

(A) a State in which the transmission facilities are to be constructed or modified does not have authority to

(i) approve the siting of the facilities; or

(ii) consider the interstate benefits or interregional benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of transmission facilities in the State;

(B) the applicant for a permit is a transmitting utility under this chapter but does not qualify to apply for a permit or siting approval for the proposed project in a State because the applicant does not serve end-use customers in the State; or

(C) a State commission or other entity that has authority to approve the siting of the facilities

(i) has not made a determination on an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law by the date that is 1 year after the later of

(I) the date on which the application was filed; and

(II) the date on which the relevant national interest electric transmission corridor was designated by the Secretary under subsection (a);

(ii) has conditioned its approval in such a manner that the proposed construction or modification will not significantly reduce transmission capacity constraints or congestion in interstate commerce or is not economically feasible; or

(iii) has denied an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law;

(2) the facilities to be authorized by the permit will be used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce;

(3) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with the public interest;

(4) the proposed construction or modification will significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce and protects or benefits consumers;

(5) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with sound national energy policy and will enhance energy independence; and

(6) the proposed modification will maximize, to the extent reasonable and economical, the transmission capabilities of existing towers or structures.
