### CHAPTER 58— ERODIBLE LAND AND WETLAND CONSERVATION AND RESERVE PROGRAM
#### § 3831. Conservation reserve
##### (b) Eligible land

The Secretary may include in the program established under this subpart

(1) highly erodible cropland that

(A)

(i) if permitted to remain untreated could substantially reduce the agricultural production capability for future generations; or

(ii) cannot be farmed in accordance with a plan that complies with the requirements of subchapter II; and

(B) the Secretary determines had a cropping history or was considered to be planted for 4 of the 6 years preceding December 20, 2018 , on the condition that the Secretary shall consider to be planted cropland enrolled in the conservation reserve program;

(2) marginal pasture land to be devoted to appropriate vegetation, including trees, in or near riparian areas, or devoted to similar water quality purposes (including marginal pastureland converted to wetland or established as wildlife habitat);

(3) grasslands that

(A) contain forbs or shrubland (including improved rangeland and pastureland) for which grazing is the predominant use;

(B) are located in an area historically dominated by grasslands; and

(C) could provide habitat for animal and plant populations of significant ecological value if the land is retained in its current use or restored to a natural condition;

(4) cropland, marginal pasture land, and grasslands that will have a positive impact on water quality and will be devoted to

(A) a grass sod waterway;

(B) a contour grass sod strip;

(C) a prairie strip;

(D) a filterstrip;

(E) a riparian buffer;

(F) a wetland or a wetland buffer;

(G) a saturated buffer;

(H) a bioreactor; or

(I) another similar water quality practice, as determined by the Secretary;

(5) cropland that is otherwise ineligible if the Secretary determines that

(A) if permitted to remain in agricultural production, the land would

(i) contribute to the degradation of soil, water, or air quality; or

(ii) pose an on-site or off-site environmental threat to soil, water, or air quality;

(B) the land is a

(i) newly-created, permanent grass sod waterway; or

(ii) a contour grass sod strip established and maintained as part of an approved conservation plan;

(C) the land will be devoted to newly established living snow fences, permanent wildlife habitat, windbreaks, shelterbelts, salt tolerant vegetation, field borders, or practices to benefit State or federally identified wellhead protection areas;

(D) the land poses an off-farm environmental threat, or a threat of continued degradation of productivity due to soil salinity, if permitted to remain in production; or

(E) enrollment of the land would facilitate a net savings in groundwater or surface water resources of the agricultural operation of the producer;

(6) the portion of land in a field not enrolled in the conservation reserve in a case in which

(A) more than 50 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a buffer or filterstrip, or more than 75 percent of the land in the field is enrolled as a conservation practice other than as a buffer or filterstrip; and

(B) the remainder of the field is

(i) infeasible to farm; and

(ii) enrolled at regular rental rates; or

(7) as determined by the Secretary, land

(A) that was enrolled in the conservation reserve program under a 15-year contract that expired on September 30, 2017 , or September 30, 2018 ;

(B) for which there was no opportunity for additional enrollment in that program; and

(C) on which the conservation practice under the expired contract under subparagraph (A) is maintained.
