(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, any Federal agency, including any independent establishment (as defined in section 104 of title 5 ), that receives a report from an entity of a cyber incident, including a ransomware attack, shall provide the report to the Agency as soon as possible, but not later than 24 hours after receiving the report, unless a shorter period is required by an agreement made between the Department of Homeland Security (including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the recipient Federal agency. The Director shall share and coordinate each report pursuant to section 681a(b) of this title , as added by section 103 of this division.

(2) Rule of construction

The requirements described in paragraph (1) and section 681e(d) of this title , as added by section 103 of this division, may not be construed to be a violation of any provision of law or policy that would otherwise prohibit disclosure or provision of information within the executive branch.

(3) Protection of information

The Director shall comply with any obligations of the recipient Federal agency described in paragraph (1) to protect information, including with respect to privacy, confidentiality, or information security, if those obligations would impose greater protection requirements than this division or the amendments made by this division.

(4) Effective date

This subsection shall take effect on the effective date of the final rule issued pursuant to section 681b(b) of this title , as added by section 103 of this division.

(5) Agency agreements

(A) In general

The Agency and any Federal agency, including any independent establishment (as defined in section 104 of title 5 ), that receives incident reports from entities, including due to ransomware attacks, shall, as appropriate, enter into a documented agreement to establish policies, processes, procedures, and mechanisms to ensure reports are shared with the Agency pursuant to paragraph (1).

(B) Availability

To the maximum extent practicable, each documented agreement required under subparagraph (A) shall be made publicly available.

(C) Requirement

The documented agreements required by subparagraph (A) shall require reports be shared from Federal agencies with the Agency in such time as to meet the overall timeline for covered entity reporting of covered cyber incidents and ransom payments established in section 681b of this title , as added by section 103 of this division.
