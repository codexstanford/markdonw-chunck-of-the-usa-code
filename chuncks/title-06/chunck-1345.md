If a covered entity impacted by a ransomware attack uses a third party to make a ransom payment, the third party shall not be required to submit a ransom payment report for itself under subsection (a)(2).

(3) Duty to report

Third-party reporting under this subparagraph does not relieve a covered entity from the duty to comply with the requirements for covered cyber incident report or ransom payment report submission.
