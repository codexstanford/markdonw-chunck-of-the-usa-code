#### § 981a. Pilot integrated scanning system
##### (c) Evaluation

The Secretary shall evaluate the pilot program in subsection (b) to determine whether such a system

(1) has a sufficiently low false alarm rate for use in the supply chain;

(2) is capable of being deployed and operated at ports overseas, including consideration of cost, personnel, and infrastructure required to operate the system;

(3) is capable of integrating, where necessary, with existing systems;

(4) does not significantly impact trade capacity and flow of cargo at foreign or United States ports; and

(5) provides an automated notification of questionable or high-risk cargo as a trigger for further inspection by appropriately trained personnel.
