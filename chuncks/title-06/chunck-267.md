##### (d) Threat assessment, response, and recovery

(1) Roles and responsibilities

(A) Distribution of information

(i) In general

(B) Response and recovery

(i) In general

The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall

(I) coordinate the response to and recovery from the effects of EMPs and GMDs on critical infrastructure, in coordination with the heads of appropriate Sector-Specific Agencies, and on matters related to the bulk power system, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and

(II) to the extent practicable, incorporate events that include EMPs and extreme GMDs as a factor in preparedness scenarios and exercises.

(ii) Implementation

The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in coordination with the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and on matters related to the bulk power system, the Secretary of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall

(I) not later than June 19, 2020 , develop plans and procedures to coordinate the response to and recovery from EMP and GMD events; and

(II) not later than December 21, 2020 , conduct a national exercise to test the preparedness and response of the Nation to the effect of an EMP or extreme GMD event.

(C) Research and development
