#### § 563. 5-year technology investment plan
##### (d) Contents of Plan

The Plan shall include

(1) an analysis of transportation security risks and the associated capability gaps that would be best addressed by security-related technology, including consideration of the most recent quadrennial homeland security review under section 347 of this title ;

(2) a set of security-related technology acquisition needs that

(A) is prioritized based on risk and associated capability gaps identified under paragraph (1); and

(B) includes planned technology programs and projects with defined objectives, goals, timelines, and measures;

(3) an analysis of current and forecast trends in domestic and international passenger travel;

(4) an identification of currently deployed security-related technologies that are at or near the end of their lifecycles;

(5) an identification of test, evaluation, modeling, and simulation capabilities, including target methodologies, rationales, and timelines necessary to support the acquisition of the security-related technologies expected to meet the needs under paragraph (2);

(6) an identification of opportunities for public-private partnerships, small and disadvantaged company participation, intragovernment collaboration, university centers of excellence, and national laboratory technology transfer;

(7) an identification of the Administration’s acquisition workforce needs for the management of planned security-related technology acquisitions, including consideration of leveraging acquisition expertise of other Federal agencies;

(8) an identification of the security resources, including information security resources, that will be required to protect security-related technology from physical or cyber theft, diversion, sabotage, or attack;

(9) an identification of initiatives to streamline the Administration’s acquisition process and provide greater predictability and clarity to small, medium, and large businesses, including the timeline for testing and evaluation;

(10) an assessment of the impact to commercial aviation passengers;

(11) a strategy for consulting airport management, air carrier representatives, and Federal security directors whenever an acquisition will lead to the removal of equipment at airports, and how the strategy for consulting with such officials of the relevant airports will address potential negative impacts on commercial passengers or airport operations; and

(12) in consultation with the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, an identification of security-related technology interface standards, in existence or if implemented, that could promote more interoperable passenger, baggage, and cargo screening systems.
