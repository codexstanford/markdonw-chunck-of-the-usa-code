(D) Reporting structure

(i) Nondepartmental and nongovernmental audits and inspections

Any audit or inspection conducted by an individual employed by a nondepartmental or nongovernmental entity shall be assigned in coordination with a regional supervisor with responsibility for supervising inspectors within the Infrastructure Security Compliance Division of the Department for the region in which the audit or inspection is to be conducted.

(ii) Requirement to report

While an individual employed by a nondepartmental or nongovernmental entity is in the field conducting an audit or inspection under this subsection, the individual shall report to the regional supervisor with responsibility for supervising inspectors within the Infrastructure Security Compliance Division of the Department for the region in which the individual is operating.

(iii) Approval

The authority to approve a site security plan under subsection (c) or determine if a covered chemical facility is in compliance with an approved site security plan shall be exercised solely by the Secretary or a designee of the Secretary within the Department.

(E) Standards for auditors and inspectors

The Secretary shall prescribe standards for the training and retraining of each individual used by the Department as an auditor or inspector, including each individual employed by the Department and all nondepartmental or nongovernmental personnel, including

(i) minimum training requirements for new auditors and inspectors;

(ii) retraining requirements;

(iii) minimum education and experience levels;

(iv) the submission of information as required by the Secretary to enable determination of whether the auditor or inspector has a conflict of interest;

(v) the proper certification or certifications necessary to handle chemical-terrorism vulnerability information (as defined in section 27.105 of title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto);

(vi) the reporting of any issue of non-compliance with this section to the Secretary within 24 hours; and

(vii) any additional qualifications for fitness of duty as the Secretary may require.

(F) Conditions for nongovernmental auditors and inspectors

(i) prescribe standards for the qualification of the individuals who carry out such audits and inspections that are commensurate with the standards for similar Government auditors or inspectors; and

(ii) ensure that any duties carried out by a nongovernmental entity are not inherently governmental functions.

(2) Personnel surety

(A) Personnel surety program

For purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish and carry out a Personnel Surety Program that

(i) does not require an owner or operator of a covered chemical facility that voluntarily participates in the program to submit information about an individual more than 1 time;

(ii) provides a participating owner or operator of a covered chemical facility with relevant information about an individual based on vetting the individual against the terrorist screening database, to the extent that such feedback is necessary for the facility to be in compliance with regulations promulgated under this subchapter; and

(iii) provides redress to an individual

(I) whose information was vetted against the terrorist screening database under the program; and

(II) who believes that the personally identifiable information submitted to the Department for such vetting by a covered chemical facility, or its designated representative, was inaccurate.

(B) Personnel surety program implementation

To the extent that a risk-based performance standard established under subsection (a) requires identifying individuals with ties to terrorism

(i) a covered chemical facility

(I) may satisfy its obligation under the standard by using any Federal screening program that periodically vets individuals against the terrorist screening database, or any successor program, including the Personnel Surety Program established under subparagraph (A); and

(II) shall

(aa) accept a credential from a Federal screening program described in subclause (I) if an individual who is required to be screened presents such a credential; and

(bb) address in its site security plan or alternative security program the measures it will take to verify that a credential or documentation from a Federal screening program described in subclause (I) is current;

(ii) visual inspection shall be sufficient to meet the requirement under clause (i)(II)(bb), but the facility should consider other means of verification, consistent with the facility’s assessment of the threat posed by acceptance of such credentials; and

(iii) the Secretary may not require a covered chemical facility to submit any information about an individual unless the individual

(I) is to be vetted under the Personnel Surety Program; or

(II) has been identified as presenting a terrorism security risk.

(C) Rights unaffected

Nothing in this section shall supersede the ability

(i) of a facility to maintain its own policies regarding the access of individuals to restricted areas or critical assets; or

(ii) of an employing facility and a bargaining agent, where applicable, to negotiate as to how the results of a background check may be used by the facility with respect to employment status.

(3) Availability of information

The Secretary shall share with the owner or operator of a covered chemical facility any information that the owner or operator needs to comply with this section.
