### CHAPTER 3— SECURITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERY PORT
#### § 967. Consequences for lack of compliance
##### (a) In general

If at any time a C–TPAT participant’s security measures and supply chain security practices fail to meet any of the requirements under this part, the Commissioner may deny the participant benefits otherwise available under this part, in whole or in part. The Commissioner shall develop procedures that provide appropriate protections to C–TPAT participants before benefits are revoked. Such procedures may not limit the ability of the Commissioner to take actions to protect the national security of the United States.
