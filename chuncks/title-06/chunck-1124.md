(B) may order the facility, without notice or opportunity for a hearing, effective immediately or as soon as practicable, to

(ii) cease or reduce some or all operations, in accordance with safe shutdown procedures, if the Secretary determines that such a cessation or reduction of operations is the most appropriate means to address the risk.

The Secretary may not delegate the authority under paragraph (1) to any official other than the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
