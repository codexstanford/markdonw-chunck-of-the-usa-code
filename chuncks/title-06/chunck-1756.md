(2) Schedule

The letter of intent under this subsection shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the recipient for the Government’s share of the project’s costs, as amounts become available, if the recipient, after the Secretary issues that letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under a grant issued under this subchapter.
