### CHAPTER 1— HOMELAND SECURITY ORGANIZATION
#### § 194. Enhancement of public safety communications interoperability
##### (i) Sense of Congress regarding interoperable communications

(1) Finding

The Congress finds that

(A) many first responders working in the same jurisdiction or in different jurisdictions cannot effectively and efficiently communicate with one another; and

(B) their inability to do so threatens the public’s safety and may result in unnecessary loss of lives and property.

(2) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that interoperable emergency communications systems and radios should continue to be deployed as soon as practicable for use by the first responder community, and that upgraded and new digital communications systems and new digital radios must meet prevailing national, voluntary consensus standards for interoperability.
