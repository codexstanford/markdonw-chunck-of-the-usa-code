The Center may terminate a voluntary information sharing relationship under this subsection, at the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Secretary, acting through the Director, for any reason, including if the Center determines that the non-Federal entity with which the Center has entered into such a relationship has violated the terms of this subsection.
