###### (h) Coordination With Retired or Retainer Pay and Disability Compensation .

(1) A member who is paid voluntary separation pay under this section and who later qualifies for retired or retainer pay under this title or title 14 shall have deducted from each payment of such retired or retainer pay an amount, in such schedule of monthly installments as the Secretary concerned shall specify, until the total amount deducted from such retired or retainer pay is equal to the total amount of voluntary separation pay so paid.

(2)

(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a member who is paid voluntary separation pay under this section shall not be deprived, by reason of the member’s receipt of such pay, of any disability compensation to which the member is entitled under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but there shall be deducted from such disability compensation an amount, in such schedule of monthly installments as the Secretary concerned shall specify, until the total amount deducted from such disability compensation is equal to the total amount of voluntary separation pay so paid, less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay (such withholding being at the flat withholding rate for Federal income tax withholding, as in effect pursuant to regulations prescribed under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).

(B) No deduction shall be made from the disability compensation paid to an eligible disabled uniformed services retiree under section 1413, or to an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed services retiree under section 1413a of this title , who is paid voluntary separation pay under this section.

(C) No deduction may be made from the disability compensation paid to a member for the amount of voluntary separation pay received by the member because of an earlier discharge or release from a period of active duty if the disability which is the basis for that disability compensation was incurred or aggravated during a later period of active duty.

(3) The requirement under this subsection to repay voluntary separation pay following retirement from the armed forces does not apply to a member who was eligible to retire at the time the member applied and was accepted for voluntary separation pay and benefits under this section.

(4) The Secretary concerned may waive the requirement to repay voluntary separation pay under paragraphs (1) and (2) if the Secretary determines that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or would be contrary to the best interests of the United States.
