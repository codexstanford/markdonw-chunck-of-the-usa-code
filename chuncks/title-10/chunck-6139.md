###### (e) Milestone B .

(A) the program incorporates clearly defined major system interfaces between the major system platform and major system components, between major system components, and between major system platforms;

(B) such major system interfaces are consistent with the widely supported and consensus-based standards that exist at the time of the milestone decision, unless such standards are unavailable or unsuitable for particular major system interfaces; and

(C) the Government has arranged to obtain appropriate and necessary intellectual property rights with respect to such major system interfaces upon completion of the development of the major system platform; or

(2) in the case of a program that does not use a modular open system approach, that the use of a modular open system approach is not practicable.
