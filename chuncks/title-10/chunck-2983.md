#### § 1452. Reduction in retired pay
###### (h) Increases in Reduction With Increases in Retired Pay.

(1) General rule .

Whenever retired pay is increased under section 1401a of this title (or any other provision of law), the amount of the reduction to be made under subsection (a) or (b) in the retired pay of any person shall be increased at the same time and by the same percentage as such retired pay is so increased.

(2) Coordination when payment of increase in retired pay is delayed by law.

(A) In general .

Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the initial payment of an increase in retired pay under section 1401a of this title (or any other provision of law) to a person is for a month that begins later than the effective date of that increase by reason of the application of subsection (b)(2)(B) of such section (or section 631(b) of Public Law 104–106 ( 110 Stat. 364 )), then the amount of the reduction in the person’s retired pay shall be effective on the date of that initial payment of the increase in retired pay rather than the effective date of the increase in retired pay.

(B) Delay not to affect computation of annuity .

Subparagraph (A) may not be construed as delaying, for purposes of determining the amount of a monthly annuity under section 1451 of this title , the effective date of an increase in a base amount under subsection (h) of such section from the effective date of an increase in retired pay under section 1401a of this title to the date on which the initial payment of that increase in retired pay is made in accordance with subsection (b)(2)(B) of such section.
