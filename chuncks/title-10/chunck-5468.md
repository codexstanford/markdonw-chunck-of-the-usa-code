###### (d) Items Developed Exclusively at Private Expense.

(1) Limitation .

Whenever the head of an agency requires that proposals described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2) be submitted by an offeror in its offer, the offeror shall not be required to provide a proposal that enables the United States to acquire competitively in the future an identical item if the item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the head of the agency determines that

(A) the original supplier of such item will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or

(B) proposals by the original supplier of such item to meet the mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency’s mobilization needs.

(2) Evaluation .

In considering offers in response to a solicitation requiring proposals described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), the head of an agency shall base any evaluation of items developed exclusively at private expense on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.
