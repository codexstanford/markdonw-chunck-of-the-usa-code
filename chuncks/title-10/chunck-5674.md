### CHAPTER 271— TRUTHFUL COST OR PRICING DATA (TRUTH IN NEGOTIATIONS)
#### § 3703. Exceptions
###### (d) Commercial product or commercial service determination .

(1) For purposes of applying the exception under subsection (a)(2) to the required submission of certified cost or pricing data, the contracting officer may presume that a prior commercial product or commercial service determination made by a military department, a Defense Agency, or another component of the Department of Defense shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such product or service.

(2) If the contracting officer does not make the presumption described in paragraph (1) and instead chooses to proceed with a procurement of a product or service previously determined to be a commercial product or a commercial service using procedures other than the procedures authorized for the procurement of a commercial product or a commercial service, as the case may be, the contracting officer shall request a review of the commercial product or commercial service determination by the head of the contracting activity.

(3) Not later than 30 days after receiving a request for review of a determination under paragraph (2), the head of a contracting activity shall

(A) confirm that the prior determination was appropriate and still applicable; or

(B) issue a revised determination with a written explanation of the basis for the revision.

(e) A contracting officer shall consider evidence provided by an offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government for the same or similar commercial products or commercial services in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison after considering the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased or applicable terms and conditions.
