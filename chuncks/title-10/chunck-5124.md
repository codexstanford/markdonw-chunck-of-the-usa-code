###### (c) Military Installation Resilience Component .

To address military installation resilience under subsection (a)(1), each installation master plan shall discuss the following:

(1) Risks and threats to military installation resilience that exist at the time of the development of the plan and that are projected for the future, including from extreme weather events, mean sea level fluctuation, wildfires, flooding, and other changes in environmental conditions.

(2) Assets or infrastructure located on the military installation vulnerable to the risks and threats described in paragraph (1), with a special emphasis on assets or infrastructure critical to the mission of the installation and the mission of members of the armed forces.

(3) Lessons learned from the impacts of extreme weather events, including changes made to the military installation to address such impacts, since the prior master plan developed under this section.

(4) Ongoing or planned infrastructure projects or other measures, as of the time of the development of the plan, to mitigate the impacts of the risks and threats described in paragraph (1).

(5) Community infrastructure and resources located outside the installation (such as medical facilities, transportation systems, and energy infrastructure) that are

(A) necessary to maintain mission capability or that impact the resilience of the military installation; and

(B) vulnerable to the risks and threats described in paragraph (1).

(6) Agreements in effect or planned, as of the time of the development of the plan, with public or private entities for the purpose of maintaining or enhancing military installation resilience or resilience of the community infrastructure and resources described in paragraph (5).

(7) Extent of current coordination efforts and plans for additional coordination, as of the time of the development of the plan, with public or private entities for the purpose of maintaining or enhancing military installation resilience or resilience of the community infrastructure and resources described in paragraph (5).

(8) Projections from recognized governmental and scientific entities such as the Census Bureau, the National Academies of Sciences, the United States Geological Survey, and the United States Global Change Research Office (or any similar successor entities) with respect to future risks and threats (including the risks and threats described in paragraph (1)) to the resilience of any project considered in the installation master plan during the 50-year lifespan of the installation.
