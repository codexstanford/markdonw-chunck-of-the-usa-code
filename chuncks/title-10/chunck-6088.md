###### (a) Requirement for Sustaining Existing Forces .

Any such sustainment plan shall provide for an appropriate level of budgeting for sustaining the existing system until the replacement system to be developed under the major defense acquisition program is fielded and assumes the majority of responsibility for the mission of the existing system. This section does not apply to a major defense acquisition that reaches initial operational capability before October 1, 2008 .

(2) In this section, the term “defense acquisition authority” means the Secretary of a military department or the commander of the United States Special Operations Command.
