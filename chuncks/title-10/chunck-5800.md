(4) The Secretary of Defense shall consider the results of an incurred cost audit performed under this section without regard to whether the Defense Contract Audit Agency or a qualified private auditor performed the audit.

(5) The contracting officer for a contract that is the subject of an incurred cost audit shall have the sole discretion to determine what action should be taken based on an audit finding on direct costs of the contract.
