The Secretary of Defense shall, with respect to each military installation or facility under the jurisdiction of any military department in a State

(1) require that all hunting, fishing, and trapping at that installation or facility be in accordance with the fish and game laws of the State in which it is located;

(2) require that an appropriate license for hunting, fishing, or trapping on that installation or facility be obtained, except that with respect to members of the armed forces, such a license may be required only if the State authorizes the issuance of a license to a member on active duty for a period of more than thirty days at an installation or facility within that State, without regard to residence requirements, and upon terms otherwise not less favorable than the terms upon which such a license is issued to residents of that State; and

(3) develop, subject to safety requirements and military security, and in cooperation with the Governor (or his designee) of the State in which the installation or facility is located, procedures under which designated fish and game or conservation officials of that State may, at such time and under such conditions as may be agreed upon, have full access to that installation or facility to effect measures for the management, conservation, and harvesting of fish and game resources.
