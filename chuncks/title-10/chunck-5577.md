### CHAPTER 245— TASK AND DELIVERY ORDER CONTRACTS (MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACTS)
#### § 3406. Task and delivery order contracts: orders
###### (c) Multiple Award Contracts .

When multiple task or delivery order contracts are awarded under section 3403(d)(1)(B) or 3405(f) of this title, all contractors awarded such contracts shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery order in excess of $2,500 that is to be issued under any of the contracts unless

(1) the agency’s need for the services or property ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such opportunity to all such contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need;

(2) only one such contractor is capable of providing the services or property required at the level of quality required because the services or property ordered are unique or highly specialized;

(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis;

(4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor in order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

(5) the task or delivery order satisfies one of the exceptions in section 3204(a) of this title to the requirement to use competitive procedures.
