(B) such annex shall be submitted to the congressional defense committees, the Congressional Budget Office, the Comptroller General of the United States, and the Congressional Research Service.

(e) Each future-years defense program under this subsection shall be accompanied by a certification by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in the case of the Department of Defense, and the comptroller of each military department, in the case of such military department, that any information entered into the Standard Data Collection System of the Department of Defense, the Comptroller Information System, or any other data system, as applicable, for purposes of assembling such future-years defense program was accurate.
