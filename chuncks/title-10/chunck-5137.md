(A) a certification by the Secretary concerned that the military value to the United States of the land to be acquired justifies a payment in excess of the fair market value; and

(B) a description of the military value to be obtained.

(3) The Secretary concerned may agree to accept a facility or improvements to an existing facility under subsection (a)(3) only if the Secretary concerned determines that the facility or improvements
