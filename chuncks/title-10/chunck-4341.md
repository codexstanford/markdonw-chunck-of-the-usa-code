###### (j) Conversion to Nonappropriated Fund Entity or Instrumentality .

(1) Subject to subsection (k), if the Secretary of Defense determines that the variable pricing program has met the benchmarks for success established pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (i) and the savings requirements established pursuant to paragraph (3) of such subsection over a period of at least six months, the Secretary may convert the defense commissary system to a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality, with operating expenses financed in whole or in part by receipts from the sale of products and the sale of services. Upon such conversion, appropriated funds shall be transferred to the defense commissary system only in accordance with paragraph (2) or section 2491 of this title . The requirements of section 2483 of this title shall not apply to the defense commissary system operating as a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality.

(2) If the Secretary determines that the defense commissary system operating as a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality is likely to incur a loss in any fiscal year as a result of compliance with the savings requirement established in subsection (i), the Secretary shall authorize a transfer of appropriated funds available for such purpose to the commissary system in an amount sufficient to offset the anticipated loss. Any funds so transferred shall be considered to be nonappropriated funds for such purpose.

(3)

(A) The Secretary may identify positions of employees in the defense commissary system who are paid with appropriated funds whose status may be converted to the status of an employee of a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality.

(B) The status and conversion of employees in a position identified by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall be addressed as provided in section 2491(c) of this title for employees in morale, welfare, and recreation programs, including with respect to requiring the consent of such employee to be so converted.

(C) No individual who is an employee of the defense commissary system as of the date of the enactment of this subsection shall suffer any loss of or decrease in pay as a result of a conversion made under this paragraph.
