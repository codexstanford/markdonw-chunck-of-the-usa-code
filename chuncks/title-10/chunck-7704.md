(3) the procurement of commercial capabilities and services, including

(A) options for integrating payloads on commercial buses and spacecraft into existing commercial architectures; and

(B) innovative commercial capabilities and services, such as on-orbit servicing or in-space transportation systems, that could extend the life of space systems, rapidly respond to threats, or contribute to resilience; and

(4) the rapid introduction, acquisition, and iteration of cost-effective, resilient solutions that leverage planned and existing commercial low-Earth orbit capabilities or innovative capabilities.
