###### (d) Contracts for Utility Services .

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a contract for the receipt of utility services as consideration under subsection (c), or any other contract for utility services entered into by the Secretary concerned in connection with the conveyance of a utility system under this section, may be for a period not to exceed 10 years.

(2) The Secretary concerned may authorize a contract for utility services described in paragraph (1) or the renewal of such a contract to have a term in excess of 10 years, but not to exceed 50 years, if the Secretary concerned determines that a contract for a longer term will be cost effective. The determination of cost effectiveness shall be made using a business case analysis that includes an independent estimate of the level of investment that should be required to maintain adequate operation of the utility system over the proposed term of the contract or contract renewal. The business case analysis must also demonstrate how a privatized system will operate in a manner consistent with subsection (g)(3). A renewal of a contract pursuant to this paragraph may be entered into only within the last five years of the existing contract term.
