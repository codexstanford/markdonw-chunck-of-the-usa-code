#### § 2218. National Defense Sealift Fund
###### (j) Contracts for Incorporation of Defense Features in Commercial Vessels .

(1) The head of an agency may enter into a contract with a company submitting an offer for that company to install and maintain defense features for national defense purposes in one or more commercial vessels owned or controlled by that company in accordance with the purpose for which funds in the National Defense Sealift Fund are available under subsection (c)(1)(C). The head of the agency may enter into such a contract only after the head of the agency makes a determination of the economic soundness of the offer. As consideration for a contract with the head of an agency under this subsection, the company entering into the contract shall agree with the Secretary of Defense to make any vessel covered by the contract available to the Secretary, fully crewed and ready for sea, at any time at any port determined by the Secretary, and for whatever duration the Secretary determines necessary.

(2) The head of an agency may make advance payments to the contractor under a contract under paragraph (1) in a lump sum, in annual payments, or in a combination thereof for costs associated with the installation and maintenance of the defense features on a vessel covered by the contract, as follows:

(A) The costs to build, procure, and install a defense feature in the vessel.

(B) The costs to periodically maintain and test any defense feature on the vessel.

(C) Any increased costs of operation or any loss of revenue attributable to the installation or maintenance of any defense feature on the vessel.

(D) Any additional costs associated with the terms and conditions of the contract.

(E) Payments of such sums as the Government would otherwise expend, if the vessel were placed in the Ready Reserve Fleet, for maintaining the vessel in the status designated as “ROS–4 status” in the Ready Reserve Fleet for 25 years.

(3) For any contract under paragraph (1) under which the United States makes advance payments under paragraph (2) for the costs associated with installation or maintenance of any defense feature on a commercial vessel, the contractor shall provide to the United States such security interests in the vessel, by way of a preferred mortgage under section 31322 of title 46 or otherwise, as the head of the agency may prescribe in order to adequately protect the United States against loss for the total amount of those costs.

(4) Each contract entered into under this subsection shall

(A) set forth terms and conditions under which, so long as a vessel covered by the contract is owned or controlled by the contractor, the contractor is to operate the vessel for the Department of Defense notwithstanding any other contract or commitment of that contractor; and

(B) provide that the contractor operating the vessel for the Department of Defense shall be paid for that operation at fair and reasonable rates.

(5) The head of an agency may not delegate authority under this subsection to any officer or employee in a position below the level of head of a procuring activity.

(6) The head of an agency may not enter into a contract under paragraph (1) that would provide for payments to the contractor as authorized in paragraph (2)(E) until notice of the proposed contract is submitted to the congressional defense committees and a period of 90 days has elapsed.
