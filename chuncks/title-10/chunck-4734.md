(A) the status of overseas base closure and realignment actions undertaken as part of a global defense posture realignment strategy; and

(B) the status of overseas military locations, whether such a location is designated as an enduring location or contingency location.

(2) To satisfy the reporting requirement specified in paragraph (1)(B), a report under paragraph (1) shall contain the following:

(C) A list of each construction or facility improvement project carried out by the Department of Defense regardless of the funding source, and each construction or facility improvement project accepted as a payment-in-kind, at overseas military locations during the previous fiscal year if the construction or facility improvement project was not specifically authorized in a Military Construction Authorization Act or congressional notice of the construction or facility improvement project was not provided by another means. Each construction or facility improvement project on the list shall be delineated by project location, project title or description, project cost, including costs covered by the host country, and authority used to undertake the project.

(D) For each overseas military location first designated as an enduring location in one of the previous two required reports, a list of required construction and facility improvement projects anticipated to be carried out by the Department of Defense directly or through the acceptance of payments-in-kind during the fiscal year in which the report is submitted and the next four fiscal years.

(E) An overview of any annual lease or access costs to the United States for each overseas military location designated as an enduring location.

(H) A summary of any force protection risks identified for cooperative security locations and contingency locations, the actions proposed to mitigate such risks, and the resourcing and implementation plan to implement the mitigation actions.

(I) Such other such matters related to overseas military locations as the Secretary of Defense considers appropriate.

(3) In this subsection:

(A)

(i) The term “overseas military location” covers both enduring locations and contingency locations established outside the United States.

(ii) An enduring location is primarily characterized either by the presence of permanently assigned United States forces with robust infrastructure and quality of life amenities to support that presence, by the sustained presence of allocated United States forces with infrastructure and quality of life amenities consistent with that presence, or by the periodic presence of allocated United States forces with little or no permanent United States military presence or controlled infrastructure. Enduring locations include main operating bases, forward operating sites, and cooperative security locations.

(iii) A contingency location refers to a location outside of the United States that is not covered by subparagraph (B), but that is used by United States forces to support and sustain operations during named and unnamed contingency operations or other operations as directed by appropriate authority and is categorized by mission life-cycle requirements as initial, temporary, or semi-permanent.

(B)

(i) The term “construction or facility improvement project” includes any construction, development, conversion, or extension of a building, structure, or other improvement to real property carried out at an overseas military location, whether to satisfy temporary or permanent requirements, and any acquisition of land for an overseas military location.

(ii) The term does not include repairs to a building, structure, or other improvement to real property, unless the building, structure, or other improvement cannot effectively be used for its designated functional purpose in the absence of the repairs.

(4) The Secretary of Defense shall prepare the report under paragraph (1) in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.

(5) A report under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex as necessary.
