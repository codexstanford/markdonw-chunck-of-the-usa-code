#### § 4273. Performance assessments and root cause analyses
###### (c) Performance Assessments .

For purposes of this section, a performance assessment with respect to a major defense acquisition program is an evaluation of the following:

(1) The cost, schedule, and performance of the program, relative to current metrics, including performance requirements and baseline descriptions.

(2) The extent to which the level of program cost, schedule, and performance predicted relative to such metrics is likely to result in the timely delivery of a level of capability to the warfighter that is consistent with the level of resources to be expended and provides superior value to alternative approaches that may be available to meet the same military requirement.
