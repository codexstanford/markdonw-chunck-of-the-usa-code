#### § 9515. Charter air transportation services: minimum annual purchase amount for carriers participating in Civil Reserve Air Fleet
###### (e) Aggregate Minimum Purchase Amount .

(1) The aggregate amount of the minimum purchase amount for all contracts awarded under subsection (c) for a fiscal year shall be based on forecast needs, but may not exceed the amount equal to 80 percent of the average annual expenditure of the Department of Defense for charter air transportation services during the five-fiscal year period ending in the fiscal year before the fiscal year for which such contracts are awarded.

(2) In calculating the average annual expenditure of the Department of Defense for charter air transportation services for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall omit from the calculation any fiscal year exhibiting unusually high demand for charter air transportation services if the Secretary determines that the omission of such fiscal year from the calculation will result in a more accurate forecast of anticipated charter air transportation services for purposes of that paragraph.
