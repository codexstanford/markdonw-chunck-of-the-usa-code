The Secretary shall ensure that a covered defense business system program cannot proceed into development (or, if no development is required, into production or fielding) unless the appropriate approval official (as specified in paragraph (2)) determines that

(A) the system has been, or is being, reengineered to be as streamlined and efficient as practicable, and the implementation of the system will maximize the elimination of unique software requirements and unique interfaces;

(B) the system and business system portfolio are or will be in compliance with the defense business enterprise architecture developed pursuant to subsection (e) or will be in compliance as a result of modifications planned;

(C) the system has valid, achievable requirements and a viable plan for implementing those requirements (including, as appropriate, market research, business process reengineering, and prototyping activities);

(D) the system has an acquisition strategy designed to eliminate or reduce the need to tailor commercial off-the-shelf systems to meet unique requirements, incorporate unique requirements, or incorporate unique interfaces to the maximum extent practicable; and

(E) the system is in compliance with the Department’s auditability requirements.

(2) Appropriate official .

For purposes of paragraph (1), the appropriate approval official with respect to a covered defense business system is the following:

(A) Except as may be provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of a priority defense business system, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense.

(B) Except as may be provided in subparagraph (C), for any defense business system other than a priority defense business system

(i) in the case of a system of a military department, the Chief Information Officer of that military department; and

(ii) in the case of a system of a Defense Agency or Department of Defense Field Activity, or a system that will support the business process of more than one military department or Defense Agency or Department of Defense Field Activity, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense.

(C) In the case of any defense business system, such official other than the applicable official under subparagraph (A) or (B) as the Secretary designates for such purpose.

(3) Annual certification .

For any fiscal year in which funds are expended for development or sustainment pursuant to a covered defense business system program, the appropriate approval official shall review the system and certify, certify with conditions, or decline to certify, as the case may be, that it continues to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1). If the approval official determines that certification cannot be granted, the approval official shall notify the milestone decision authority for the program and provide a recommendation for corrective action.

(4) Obligation of funds in violation of requirements .

The obligation of Department of Defense funds for a covered defense business system program that has not been certified in accordance with paragraph (3) is a violation of section 1341(a)(1)(A) of title 31 .
