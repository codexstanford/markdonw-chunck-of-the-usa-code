(iii) Identify and define levels of risk, including an identification of what constitutes “significant” risk in the judgment of the Chairman.

(iv)

(I) Identify and assess risk in the National Military Strategy (or update) by category and level and the ways in which risk might manifest itself, including how risk is projected to increase, decrease, or remain stable over time; and

(II) for each category of risk, assess the extent to which current or future risk increases, decreases, or is stable as a result of budgetary priorities, tradeoffs, or fiscal constraints or limitations as currently estimated and applied in the current future-years defense program under section 221 of this title .

(v) Identify and assess risk associated with the assumptions or plans of the National Military Strategy (or update) about the contributions of external support, as appropriate.
