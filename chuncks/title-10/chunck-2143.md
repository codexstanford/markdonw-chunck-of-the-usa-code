#### § 1044e. Special Victims’ Counsel for victims of sex-related offenses
###### (f) Availability of Special Victims’ Counsel .

(1) An individual described in subsection (a)(2) who is the victim of an alleged sex-related offense shall be offered the option of receiving assistance from a Special Victims’ Counsel upon report of an alleged sex-related offense or at the time the victim seeks assistance from a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate, a military criminal investigator, a victim/witness liaison, a trial counsel, a healthcare provider, or any other personnel designated by the Secretary concerned for purposes of this subsection.

(2) Subject to such exceptions for exigent circumstances as the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating may prescribe, notice of the availability of a Special Victims’ Counsel shall be provided to an individual described in subsection (a)(2) before any military criminal investigator or trial counsel interviews, or requests any statement from, the individual regarding the alleged sex-related offense.

(3) The assistance of a Special Victims’ Counsel under this subsection shall be available to an individual described in subsection (a)(2) regardless of whether the individual elects unrestricted or restricted reporting of the alleged sex-related offense. The individual shall also be informed that the assistance of a Special Victims’ Counsel may be declined, in whole or in part, but that declining such assistance does not preclude the individual from subsequently requesting the assistance of a Special Victims’ Counsel.

(4)

(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), if a Special Victims’ Counsel is not available at a military installation for access by a member of the armed forces who requests access to a Special Victims’ Counsel, a Special Victims’ Counsel shall be made available at such installation for access by such member by not later than 72 hours after such request.

(B) If the Secretary concerned determines that, due to exigent circumstances related to military activities, a Special Victims’ Counsel cannot be made available to a member of the armed forces within the time period required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary concerned shall ensure that a Special Victims’ Counsel is made available to such member as soon as is practical under such circumstances.
