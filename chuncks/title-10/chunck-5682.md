### CHAPTER 271— TRUTHFUL COST OR PRICING DATA (TRUTH IN NEGOTIATIONS)
#### § 3706. Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data
###### (a) Provision Requiring Adjustment.

(1) In general .

A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under section 3702(b) of this title is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.

(2) What constitutes defective cost or pricing data .

For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.
