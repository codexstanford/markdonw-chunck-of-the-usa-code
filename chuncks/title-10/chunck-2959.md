(i) furnishes to the Secretary concerned a certified copy of a court order which is regular on its face and which modifies the provisions of all previous court orders relating to such election, or the agreement to make such election, so as to permit the person to change the election; and

(ii) certifies to the Secretary concerned that the court order is valid and in effect.

(B) In a case of a written agreement that has not been incorporated in or ratified or approved by a court order, the person

(i) furnishes to the Secretary concerned a statement, in such form as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, signed by the former spouse and evidencing the former spouse’s agreement to a change in the election under paragraph (1); and

(ii) certifies to the Secretary concerned that the statement is current and in effect.

(3) Required former spouse election to be deemed to have been made.

(D) Effective date of deemed election .

An election deemed to have been made under subparagraph (A) shall become effective on the day referred to in section 1448(b)(3)(E)(ii) of this title .
