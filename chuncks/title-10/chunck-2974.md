#### § 1451. Amount of annuity
###### (h) Adjustments to Base Amount.

(1) Periodic adjustments for cost-of-living.

(A) Increases in base amount when retired pay increased .

Whenever retired pay is increased under section 1401a of this title (or any other provision of law), the base amount applicable to each participant in the Plan shall be increased at the same time.

(B) Percentage of increase .

The increase shall be by the same percent as the percent by which the retired pay of the participant is so increased.

(2) Recomputation at age 62 .

When the retired pay of a person who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after August 1, 1986 , and who is a participant in the Plan is recomputed under section 1410 of this title upon the person’s becoming 62 years of age, the base amount applicable to that person shall be recomputed (effective on the effective date of the recomputation of such retired pay under section 1410 of this title ) so as to be the amount equal to the amount of the base amount that would be in effect on that date if increases in such base amount under paragraph (1) had been computed as provided in paragraph (2) of section 1401a(b) of this title (rather than under paragraph (3) of that section).

(3) Disregarding of retired pay reductions for retirement of certain members before 30 years of service .

Computation of a member’s retired pay for purposes of this section shall be made without regard to any reduction under section 1409(b)(2) of this title .
