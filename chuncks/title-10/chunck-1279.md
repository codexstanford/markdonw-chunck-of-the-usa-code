#### § 656. Diversity in military leadership: plan; mentoring and career counseling program
###### (c) Metrics to Measure Progress in Developing and Implementing Plan and Mentoring and Career Counseling Program .

In developing and implementing the plan under subsection (a) and the mentoring and career counseling program under subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop a standard set of metrics and collection procedures that are uniform across the armed forces. The metrics required by this subsection shall be designed

(1) to accurately capture the inclusion and capability aspects of the armed forces’ broader diversity plans, including race, ethnic, and gender specific groups, as potential factors of force readiness that would supplement continued accounting by the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard of diversified language and cultural skills among the total force as part of the assessment of current and future national security needs; and

(2) to be verifiable and systematically linked to strategic plans that will drive improvements.
