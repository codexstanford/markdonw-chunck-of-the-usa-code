###### (c) Applicability, Waiver Authority, and Referral of Offers.

Subsection (b) does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action before October 19, 1984 , unless such requirement is a qualified products list.

(2) Waiver Authority.

(A) Submission of determination of unreasonableness .

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement.

(B) Authority to grant waiver .

After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the purchasing office may waive the requirements of clauses (2) through (6) of subsection (b) for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.

(C) Inapplicability to qualified products list .

The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.

(3) Submission and consideration of offer not to be denied in certain cases .

A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror (A) is not on a qualified bidders list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified products list, or (B) has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19, 1984 , if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer (or, in the case of a contract for the procurement of an aviation critical safety item or ship critical safety item, the head of the design control activity for such item) that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.

(4) Referral to small business administration .

Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7) ) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror’s compliance with such requirement.

(5) Delay of procurement not required .

The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.

(6) Requirements before enforcement of certain lists .

The requirements of subsection (b) also apply before enforcement of any qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list.
