If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is between any two consecutive numbers in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that component are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is more or less than the highest or lowest number, respectively, set forth in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in the table at the same proportion as is reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.
