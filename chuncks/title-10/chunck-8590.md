(e)

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), for each accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance made with respect to an eligible person under this section, the person’s entitlement to educational assistance under this chapter shall be charged the number of months (and any fraction thereof) determined by dividing the amount of the accelerated payment by the full-time monthly rate of educational assistance allowance otherwise payable with respect to the person under section 16131 of this title as of the beginning date of the enrollment period for the program of education for which the accelerated payment is made.

(2) If the monthly rate of educational assistance allowance otherwise payable with respect to an eligible person under section 16131 of this title increases during the enrollment period of a program of education for which an accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance is made under this section, the charge to the person’s entitlement to educational assistance under this chapter shall be determined by prorating the entitlement chargeable, in the manner provided for under paragraph (1), for the periods covered by the initial rate and increased rate, respectively, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

(f) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. The regulations shall include requirements, conditions, and methods for the request, issuance, delivery, certification of receipt and use, and recovery of overpayment of an accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance under this section.
