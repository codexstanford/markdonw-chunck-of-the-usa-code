###### (c) Definitions .

In this section:

(1) The term “net-cost basis”, with respect to a contract for the dismantling of a vessel, means that the amount to be paid to the contractor under the contract for dismantling and for removal and disposal of hazardous waste material is discounted by the offeror’s estimate of the value of scrap and reusable items that the contractor will remove from the vessel during performance of the contract.

(2) The term “scrap” means personal property that has no value except for its basic material content.

(3) The term “reusable item” means a demilitarized component or a removable portion of a vessel or equipment that the Secretary of the Navy has identified as excess to the needs of the Navy but which has potential resale value on the open market.
