(5)

(A) The agreement shall require the entity or entities to transfer to the United States, upon the request of the Secretary concerned, all or a portion of the property or interest acquired under the agreement or a lesser interest therein. No such requirement need be included in the agreement if the property or interest is being transferred to a State or another Federal agency, or the agreement requires it to be subsequently transferred to a State or another Federal agency, and the Secretary concerned determines that the laws and regulations applicable to the future use of such property or interest provide adequate assurance that the property concerned will be developed and used in a manner appropriate for purposes of this section. The Secretary shall limit such transfer request to the minimum property or interests necessary to ensure that the property concerned is developed and used in a manner appropriate for purposes of this section.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if all or a portion of the property or interest acquired under the agreement is initially or subsequently transferred to a State or another Federal agency, before that State or other Federal agency may declare the property or interest in excess to its needs or propose to exchange the property or interest, the State or other Federal agency shall give the Secretary concerned reasonable advance notice of its intent. If the Secretary concerned determines it necessary to preserve the purposes of this section, the Secretary concerned may request that administrative jurisdiction over the property be transferred to the Secretary concerned at no cost, and, upon such a request being made, the administrative jurisdiction over the property shall be transferred accordingly. If the Secretary concerned does not make such a request within a reasonable time period, all such rights of the Secretary concerned to request transfer of the property or interest shall remain available to the Secretary concerned with respect to future transfers or exchanges of the property or interest and shall bind all subsequent transferees.

(6) The Secretary concerned may accept on behalf of the United States any property or interest to be transferred to the United States under the agreement.

(7) For purposes of the acceptance of property or interests under the agreement, the Secretary concerned may accept an appraisal or title documents prepared or adopted by a non-Federal entity as satisfying the applicable requirements of section 301 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 ( 42 U.S.C. 4651 ) or section 3111 of title 40 , if the Secretary concerned finds that the appraisal or title documents substantially comply with the requirements.
