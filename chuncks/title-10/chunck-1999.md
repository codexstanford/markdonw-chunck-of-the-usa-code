# Title 10— ARMED FORCES
## Subtitle A— General Military Law
### CHAPTER 47A— MILITARY COMMISSIONS
#### § 950p. Definitions; construction of certain offenses; common circumstances
###### (d) Effect .

The provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable by military commission. This chapter does not establish new crimes that did not exist before the date of the enactment of this subchapter, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, but rather codifies those crimes for trial by military commission. Because the provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable under the law of war or otherwise triable by military commission, this subchapter does not preclude trial for offenses that occurred before the date of the enactment of this subchapter, as so amended.
