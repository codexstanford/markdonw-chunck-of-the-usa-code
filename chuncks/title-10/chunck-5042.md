(a)

(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary of the military department concerned may lease housing facilities at or near a military installation in the United States, Puerto Rico, or Guam for assignment, without rental charge, as family housing to members of the armed forces and for assignment, with fair market rental charge, as family housing to civilian employees of the Department of Defense stationed at such installation.

(2) A lease may only be made under paragraph (1) if the Secretary concerned finds that there is a shortage of adequate housing at or near such military installation and that

(A) the requirement for such housing is temporary;

(B) leasing would be more cost effective than construction or acquisition of new housing;

(C) family housing is required for personnel attending service school academic courses on permanent change of station orders;

(D) construction of family housing at such installation has been authorized by law but is not yet completed; or

(E) a military construction authorization bill pending in Congress includes a request for authorization of construction of family housing at such installation.

(b)

(1) Not more than 10,000 family housing units may be leased at any one time under subsection (a).

(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3), (4), and (7), expenditures for the rental of housing units under subsection (a) (including the cost of utilities, maintenance, and operation) may not exceed $12,000 per unit per year, as adjusted from time to time under paragraph (5).

(3) Not more than 500 housing units may be leased under subsection (a) for which the expenditure for the rental of such units (including the cost of utilities, maintenance, and operation) exceeds the maximum amount per unit per year in effect under paragraph (2) but does not exceed $14,000 per unit per year, as adjusted from time to time under paragraph (5).

(4)

(A) The Secretary of the Army may lease not more than eight housing units in the vicinity of Miami, Florida, for key and essential personnel, as designated by the Secretary, for the United States Southern Command for which the expenditure for the rental of such units (including the cost of utilities, maintenance, and operation, including security enhancements) exceeds the expenditure limitations in paragraphs (2) and (3).

(B) The amount of all leases under this paragraph may not exceed $280,000 per year, as adjusted from time to time under paragraph (6).

Costs incurred for the leased housing unit during the assignment shall be included in the costs subject to the limitation under subparagraph (B).

(5) At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Secretary concerned shall adjust the maximum lease amount provided for leases under paragraphs (2), (3), and (7) for the previous fiscal year by the percentage (if any) by which the national average monthly cost of housing (as calculated for purposes of determining rates of basic allowance for housing under section 403 of title 37 ) for the preceding fiscal year exceeds the national average monthly cost of housing (as so calculated) for the fiscal year before such preceding fiscal year.

(6) At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Army shall adjust the maximum aggregate amount for leases under paragraph (4) for the previous fiscal year by the percentage (if any) by which the annual average cost of housing for the Miami Military Housing Area (as calculated for purposes of determining rates of basic allowance for housing under section 403 of title 37 ) for the preceding fiscal year exceeds the annual average cost of housing for the Miami Military Housing Area (as so calculated) for the fiscal year before such preceding fiscal year.
