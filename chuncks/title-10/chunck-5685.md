#### § 3706. Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data
###### (d) Offsets.

(1) When allowed .

A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if

(A) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor’s knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and

(B) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in section 3702(c) of this title before such date.

(2) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if

(A) the certification under section 3702(b) of this title with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or

(B) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in paragraph (1)(B) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.
