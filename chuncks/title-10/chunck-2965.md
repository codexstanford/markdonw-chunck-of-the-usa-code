Upon application of the beneficiary of a participant in the Plan who is missing, the Secretary concerned may determine for purposes of this subchapter that the participant is presumed dead.

(B) Participant who is missing .

A participant in the Plan is considered to be missing for purposes of this subsection if

(i) the retired pay of the participant has been suspended on the basis that the participant is missing; or

(ii) in the case of a participant in the Plan who would be eligible for reserve-component retired pay but for the fact that he is under 60 years of age, his retired pay, if he were entitled to retired pay, would be suspended on the basis that he is missing.

(C) Requirements applicable to presumption of death .

Any such determination shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed under section 1455 of this title . The Secretary concerned may not make a determination for purposes of this subchapter that a participant who is missing is presumed dead unless the Secretary finds that

(i) the participant has been missing for at least 30 days; and

(ii) the circumstances under which the participant is missing would lead a reasonably prudent person to conclude that the participant is dead.

(2) Commencement of annuity .

Upon a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to a participant in the Plan, an annuity otherwise payable under this subchapter shall be paid as if the participant died on the date as of which the retired pay of the participant was suspended.

(3) Effect of person not being dead.

(A) Termination of annuity .

If, after a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned determines that the participant is alive

(i) any annuity being paid under this subchapter by reason of this subsection shall be terminated; and

(ii) the total amount of any annuity payments made by reason of this subsection shall constitute a debt to the United States.

(B) Collection from participant of annuity amounts erroneously paid .

A debt under subparagraph (A)(ii) may be collected or offset

(i) from any retired pay otherwise payable to the participant;

(ii) if the participant is entitled to compensation under chapter 11 of title 38, from that compensation; or

(iii) if the participant is entitled to any other payment from the United States, from that payment.

(C) Collection from beneficiary .

If the participant dies before the full recovery of the amount of annuity payments described in subparagraph (A)(ii) has been made by the United States, the remaining amount of such annuity payments may be collected from the participant’s beneficiary under the Plan if that beneficiary was the recipient of the annuity payments made by reason of this subsection.
