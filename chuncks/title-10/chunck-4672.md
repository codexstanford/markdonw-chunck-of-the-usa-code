###### (b) Waiver Authority .

(1) The Secretary of Defense may waive or otherwise modify the fish and game laws of a State otherwise applicable under subsection (a)(1) to hunting, fishing, or trapping at a military installation or facility if the Secretary determines that the application of such laws to such hunting, fishing, or trapping without modification could result in undesirable consequences for public health or safety at the installation or facility. The authority to waive such laws includes the authority to extend, but not reduce, the specified season for certain hunting, fishing, or trapping. The Secretary may not waive the requirements under subsection (a)(2) regarding a license for such hunting, fishing, or trapping or any fee imposed by a State to obtain such a license.

(2) If the Secretary determines that a waiver of fish and game laws of a State is appropriate under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide written notification to the appropriate State officials stating the reasons for, and extent of, the waiver. The notification shall be provided at least 30 days before implementation of the waiver.
