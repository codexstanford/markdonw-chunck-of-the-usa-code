### CHAPTER 102— JUNIOR RESERVE OFFICERS’ TRAINING CORPS
#### § 2031. Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
###### (c) The Secretary of the military department concerned shall, to support the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program

(1) detail officers and noncommissioned officers of an armed force under his jurisdiction to institutions having units of the Corps as administrators and instructors;

(2) provide necessary text materials, equipment, and uniforms and, to the extent considered appropriate by the Secretary concerned, such additional resources (including transportation and billeting) as may be available to support activities of the program; and

(3) establish minimum acceptable standards for performance and achievement for qualified units.

(d) Instead of, or in addition to, detailing officers and noncommissioned officers on active duty under subsection (c)(1), the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize qualified institutions to employ, as administrators and instructors in the program, retired officers and noncommissioned officers who are in receipt of retired pay, and members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, whose qualifications are approved by the Secretary and the institution concerned and who request such employment, subject to the following:

(1) A retired member so employed is entitled to receive the member’s retired or retainer pay without reduction by reason of any additional amount paid to the member by the institution concerned. In the case of payment of any such additional amount by the institution concerned, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall pay to that institution the amount equal to one-half of the amount paid to the retired member by the institution for any period, up to a maximum of one-half of the difference between the member’s retired or retainer pay for that period and the active duty pay and allowances which the member would have received for that period if on active duty. Notwithstanding the limitation in the preceding sentence, the Secretary concerned may pay to the institution more than one-half of the additional amount paid to the retired member by the institution if (as determined by the Secretary) the institution is in an educationally and economically deprived area and the Secretary determines that such action is in the national interest. Payments by the Secretary concerned under this paragraph shall be made from funds appropriated for that purpose.

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such a retired member is not, while so employed, considered to be on active duty or inactive duty training for any purpose.

(e) Instead of, or in addition to, detailing officers and noncommissioned officers on active duty under subsection (c)(1) and authorizing the employment of retired officers and noncommissioned officers who are in receipt of retired pay and members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve under subsection (d), the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize qualified institutions to employ as administrators and instructors in the program officers and noncommissioned officers who are under 60 years of age and who, but for age, would be eligible for retired pay for non-regular service under section 12731 of this title and whose qualifications are approved by the Secretary and the institution concerned and who request such employment, subject to the following:

(1) The Secretary concerned shall pay to the institution an amount equal to one-half of the amount paid to the member by the institution for any period, up to a maximum of one-half of the difference between

(A) the retired or retainer pay for an active duty officer or noncommissioned officer of the same grade and years of service for such period; and

(B) the active duty pay and allowances which the member would have received for that period if on active duty.

(2) Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may pay to the institution more than one-half of the amount paid to the member by the institution if (as determined by the Secretary)

(A) the institution is in an educationally and economically deprived area; and

(B) the Secretary determines that such action is in the national interest.

(3) Payments by the Secretary concerned under this subsection shall be made from funds appropriated for that purpose.

(4) Amounts may be paid under this subsection with respect to a member after the member reaches the age of 60.

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a member employed by a qualified institution pursuant to an authorization under this subsection is not, while so employed, considered to be on active duty or inactive duty training for any purpose.

(f)

(1) Instead of, or in addition to, detailing officers and noncommissioned officers on active duty under subsection (c)(1) or authorizing the employment of retired officers and noncommissioned officers under subsection (d) or (e), the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize qualified institutions to employ as administrators and instructors in the program officers or noncommissioned officers who

(i) receive honorable discharges

(I) after completing at least eight years of service; and

(II) not longer than five years before applying for such employment; or

(ii)

(I) are in an active status; and

(II) who are not yet eligible for retired pay; and

(B) apply for such employment.

(2) The Secretary of the military department concerned shall pay to the institution an amount equal to one-half of the amount to be paid to an instructor pursuant to the JROTC Instructor Pay Scale for any period.

(3) Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (2), the Secretary of the military department concerned may pay to the institution more than one-half of the amount paid to the member by the institution if, as determined by such Secretary

(A) the institution is in an educationally and economically deprived area; and

(B) such action is in the national interest.

(4) Payments under this subsection shall be made from funds appropriated for that purpose.

(5) The Secretary of the military department concerned may require an officer or noncommissioned officer employed under this subsection to transfer to the Individual Ready Reserve as a condition of such employment.

(g)

(1) When determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned to be in the national interest and agreed upon by the institution concerned, the institution may reimburse a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps instructor for moving expenses incurred by the instructor to accept employment at the institution in a position that the Secretary concerned determines is hard-to-fill for geographic or economic reasons.

(2) As a condition on providing reimbursement under paragraph (1), the institution shall require the instructor to execute a written agreement to serve a minimum of two years of employment at the institution in the hard-to-fill position.

(3) Any reimbursement provided to an instructor under paragraph (1) is in addition to the minimum instructor pay otherwise payable to the instructor.

(4) The Secretary concerned shall reimburse an institution providing reimbursement to an instructor under paragraph (1) in an amount equal to the amount of the reimbursement paid by the institution under that paragraph. Any reimbursement provided by the Secretary concerned shall be provided from funds appropriated for that purpose.

(5) The provision of reimbursement under paragraph (1) or (4) shall be subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense for purposes of this subsection.

(h)

(1) Each public secondary educational institution that maintains a unit under this section shall permit membership in the unit to homeschooled students residing in the area served by the institution who are qualified for membership in the unit (but for lack of enrollment in the institution).

(2) A student who is a member of a unit pursuant to this subsection shall count toward the satisfaction by the institution concerned of the requirement in subsection (b)(1) relating to the minimum number of student members in the unit necessary for the continuing maintenance of the unit.
