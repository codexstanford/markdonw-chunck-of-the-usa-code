### CHAPTER 71— COMPUTATION OF RETIRED PAY
#### § 1401a. Adjustment of retired pay and retainer pay to reflect changes in Consumer Price Index
###### (f) Prevention of Pay Inversions.

(1) Prevention of retired pay inversions for members with retired pay computed using final basic pay .

The monthly retired pay of a member or a former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980 , and who initially became entitled to that pay on or after January 1, 1971 , may not be less than the monthly retired pay to which he would be entitled if he had become entitled to retired pay at an earlier date based on the grade in which the member is retired, adjusted to reflect any applicable increases in such pay under this section. In computing the amount of retired pay to which such a member or former member would have been entitled on that earlier date, the computation shall be based on his grade, length of service, and the rate of basic pay applicable to him at that time, except that such computation may not be based on a rate of basic pay for a grade higher than the grade in which the member is retired. This subsection does not authorize any increase in the monthly retired pay to which a member was entitled for any period before October 7, 1975 .

(2) Prevention of retired pay inversions for members with retired pay computed using high-three .

Subject to subsections (d) and (e), the monthly retired pay of a member or former member of an armed force who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after September 8, 1980 , may not be less, on the date on which the member or former member initially becomes entitled to such pay, than the monthly retired pay to which the member or former member would be entitled on that date if the member or former member had become entitled to retired pay on an earlier date, adjusted to reflect any applicable increases in such pay under this section. However, in the case of a member or former member whose retired pay is computed subject to section 1407(f) of this title , paragraph (1) (rather than the preceding sentence) shall apply in the same manner as if the member or former member first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980 , but only with respect to a calculation as of the date on which the member or former member first became entitled to retired pay.

(3) Prevention of cola inversions .

The percentage of the first adjustment under this section in the retired pay of any person, as determined under subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), (d), or (e), may not exceed the percentage increase in retired pay determined under subsection (b)(2) that is effective on the same date as the effective date of such first adjustment.
