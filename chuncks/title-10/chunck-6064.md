#### § 4252. Major defense acquisition programs: certification required before Milestone B approval
###### (d) Waiver for National Security .

(1) The milestone decision authority may, at the time of Milestone B approval or at the time that such milestone decision authority withdraws a certification or rescinds Milestone B approval pursuant to subsection (b)(2), waive the applicability to a major defense acquisition program of one or more components (as specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a)) of the certification and determination requirements if the milestone decision authority determines that, but for such a waiver, the Department would be unable to meet critical national security objectives.

(2) Whenever the milestone decision authority makes such a determination and authorizes such a waiver

(A) the waiver, the waiver determination, and the reasons for the waiver determination shall be submitted in writing to the congressional defense committees within 30 days after the waiver is authorized; and

(B) the milestone decision authority shall review the program not less often than annually to determine the extent to which such program currently satisfies the certification and determination components specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) until such time as the milestone decision authority determines that the program satisfies all such certification and determination components.

(3) The requirement in paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to a program for which a certification was required pursuant to section 4377 of this title if the milestone decision authority

(A) determines in writing that

(i) the program has reached a stage in the acquisition process at which it would not be practicable to meet the certification component that was waived; and

(ii) the milestone decision authority has taken appropriate alternative actions to address the underlying purposes of such certification component; and

(B) submits the written determination, and an explanation of the basis for the determination, to the congressional defense committees.
