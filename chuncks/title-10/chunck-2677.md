(2) Under an agreement referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall agree to pay to the health care provider involved an amount based upon the basic salary paid by the health care provider to the participant. The rate of payment by the Secretary concerned shall be as follows:

(A) For the first year of employment, 50 percent of the basic salary, except that the payment may not exceed $25,000.

(B) For the second year of employment, 40 percent of the basic salary, except that the payment may not exceed $10,000.

(C) For the third year of employment, 30 percent of the basic salary, except that the payment may not exceed $7,500.

(3) Payments required under paragraph (2) may be made by the Secretary concerned in such installments as the Secretary concerned may determine.

(4) If a participant who is placed under this program leaves the employment of the health care provider before the end of the five years of required employment service, the provider shall reimburse the Secretary concerned in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount already paid under the agreement as the unserved portion bears to the five years of required service.

(5) The Secretary concerned may not make a grant under this subsection to a health care provider if the Secretary concerned determines that the provider terminated the employment of another employee in order to fill the vacancy so created with a participant in this program.
