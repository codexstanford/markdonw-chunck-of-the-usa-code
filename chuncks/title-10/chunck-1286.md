(2) Certain officers shall be designated as joint qualified by the Secretary of Defense with the advice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

(B) meets such additional criteria as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense; and

(C) holds the grade of captain or, in the case of the Navy, lieutenant or a higher grade.

(4) The authority of the Secretary of Defense under paragraph (2) to designate officers as joint qualified may be delegated only to the Deputy Secretary of Defense or an Under Secretary of Defense.
