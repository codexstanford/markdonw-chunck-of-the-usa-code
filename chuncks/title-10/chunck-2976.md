Whenever there is an increase in the rates of basic pay of members of the uniformed services effective on or after October 1, 1985 , the amounts under paragraph (1) with respect to which the percentage factor of 2½ is applied shall be increased by the overall percentage of such increase in the rates of basic pay. The increase under the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to persons whose retired pay is computed based on the rates of basic pay in effect on or after the date of such increase in rates of basic pay.

(B) Adjustments for retired pay colas .

In addition to the increase under subparagraph (A), the amounts under paragraph (1) with respect to which the percentage factor of 2½ is applied shall be further increased at the same time and by the same percentage as an increase in retired pay under section 1401a of this title effective on or after October 1, 1985 . Such increase under the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a person who initially participates in the Plan on a date which is after both the effective date of such increase under section 1401a and the effective date of the rates of basic pay upon which that person’s retired pay is computed.

(5) Spouse coverage described .

For the purposes of paragraph (1), a participant in the Plan who is providing spouse coverage is a participant who

(A) has (i) a spouse or former spouse, or (ii) a spouse or former spouse and a dependent child; and
