###### (d) Information Submitted for Procurements That Are Not Covered by the Exceptions in Section 3703 (a)( 1 ) of This Title .

(1) To the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price for items acquired under this section, the offeror shall, in accordance with paragraph (4), submit to the contracting officer or provide the contracting officer access to

(A) a representative sample, as determined by the contracting officer, of the prices paid for the same or similar commercial products under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers, and the terms and conditions of such sales;

(B) if the contracting officer determines that the offeror does not have access to and cannot provide sufficient information described in subparagraph (A) to determine the reasonableness of price, a representative sample, as determined by the contracting officer, of the prices paid for the same or similar commercial products sold under different terms and conditions, and the terms and conditions of such sales; and

(C) only if the contracting officer determines that the information submitted pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price because either the comparable commercial products provided by the offeror are not a valid basis for a price analysis or the contracting officer determines the proposed price is not reasonable after evaluating sales data, and the contracting officer receives the approval described in paragraph (5), other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.

(2) An offeror may submit information or analysis relating to the value of a commercial product to aid in the determination of the reasonableness of the price of such item. A contracting officer may consider such information or analysis in addition to the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B).

(3) An offeror may not be required to submit information described in paragraph (1)(C) with regard to a commercially available off-the-shelf item and may be required to submit such information with regard to any other item that was developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.

(4)

(A) An offeror may redact data information submitted or made available under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) with respect to sales of an item acquired under this section only to the extent necessary to remove information individually identifying government customers, commercial customers purchasing such item for governmental purposes, and commercial customers purchasing such item for commercial, mixed, or unknown purposes.

(B) Before an offeror may exercise the authority under subparagraph (A) with respect to a customer, the offeror shall certify in writing to the contracting officer whether the customer is a government customer, a commercial customer purchasing the item for governmental purpose, or a commercial customer purchasing the item for a commercial, mixed, or unknown purpose.

(5) A contracting officer may not require an offeror to submit or make available information under paragraph (1)(C) without approval from a level above the contracting officer.

(6) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve an offeror of other obligations under any other law or regulation to disclose and support the actual rationale of the offeror for the price proposed by the offeror to the Government for any good or service.
