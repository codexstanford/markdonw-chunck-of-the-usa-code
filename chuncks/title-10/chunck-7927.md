#### § 9515. Charter air transportation services: minimum annual purchase amount for carriers participating in Civil Reserve Air Fleet
###### (a) In General .

The Secretary shall take steps to

(1) improve the predictability in Department of Defense charter requirements;

(3) provide incentives for commercial air carriers to provide newer, more efficient and reliable aircraft for Department of Defense service rather than older, fully depreciated aircraft.
