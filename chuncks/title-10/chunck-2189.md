#### § 1059. Dependents of members separated for dependent abuse: transitional compensation; commissary and exchange benefits
###### (g) Spouse and Former Spouse Forfeiture Provisions .

(1) If a former spouse receiving compensation under this section remarries, the Secretary shall terminate payment of such compensation, effective as of the date of such marriage. The Secretary may not renew payment of compensation under this section to such former spouse in the event of the termination of such subsequent marriage.

(2) If after a punitive or other adverse action is executed in the case of a former member as described in subsection (b) the former member resides in the same household as the spouse or former spouse, or dependent child, to whom compensation is otherwise payable under this section, the Secretary shall terminate payment of such compensation, effective as of the time the former member begins residing in such household. Compensation paid for a period after the former member’s separation, but before the former member resides in the household, shall not be recouped. If the former member subsequently ceases to reside in such household before the end of the period of eligibility for such payments, the Secretary may not resume such payments.

(3) In a case in which the victim of the dependent-abuse offense resulting in a punitive or other adverse action described in subsection (b) was a dependent child, the Secretary concerned may not pay compensation under this section to a spouse or former spouse who would otherwise be eligible to receive such compensation if the Secretary determines (under regulations prescribed under subsection (k)) that the spouse or former spouse was an active participant in the conduct constituting the dependent-abuse offense.
