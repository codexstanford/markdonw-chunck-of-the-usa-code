#### § 3782. Technical data: challenges to contractor restrictions
###### (d) Justification .

It is a justification of an asserted use or release restriction challenged under subsection (a) that, within the three-year period preceding the challenge to the restriction, the Department of Defense validated a restriction identical to the asserted restriction if

(1) such validation occurred after a challenge to the validated restriction under this section; and

(2) the validated restriction was asserted by the same contractor or subcontractor (or a licensee of such contractor or subcontractor).
