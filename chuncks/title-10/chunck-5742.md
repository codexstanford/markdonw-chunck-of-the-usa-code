#### § 3782. Technical data: challenges to contractor restrictions
###### (a) Challenges by Secretary of Defense .

The Secretary of Defense may challenge a use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this subchapter if the Secretary finds that

(1) reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction; and

(2) the continued adherence by the United States to the asserted restriction would make it impracticable to procure the item to which the technical data pertain competitively at a later time.
