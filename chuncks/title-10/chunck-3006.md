(B) in the case of a death in a foreign country, by that foreign country under any applicable treaty, status of forces agreement, or other international agreement between the United States and that foreign country.

(2) Paragraph (1) does not limit the authority of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner to conduct a forensic pathology investigation of a death that is subject to the exercise of primary jurisdiction by another sovereign if the investigation by the other sovereign is concluded without a forensic pathology investigation that the Armed Forces Medical Examiner considers complete.
