### CHAPTER 73— ANNUITIES BASED ON RETIRED OR RETAINER PAY
#### § 1437. Payment of annuity
###### (b) Each annuity payable to or on behalf of an eligible child (other than a child who is incapable of supporting himself because of a mental defect or physical incapacity existing before his eighteenth birthday) as defined in section 1435(2)(B) of this title who is at least eighteen years of age and pursuing a full-time course of study or training at a recognized educational institution, accrues

(1) as of the first day of the month in which the member upon whose pay the annuity is based dies, if the eligible child’s eighteenth birthday occurs in the same or a preceding month.

(2) as of the first day of the month in which the eighteenth birthday of an eligible child occurs, if the member upon whose pay the annuity is based died in a preceding month.

(3) as of the first day of the month in which a child first becomes or again becomes eligible, if that eligible child’s eighteenth birthday and the death of the member upon whose pay the annuity is based both occurred in a preceding month or months. However, no such annuity is payable or accrues for any month before November 1, 1968 .

(c)

(1) Upon application of the beneficiary of a member entitled to retired or retainer pay whose retired or retainer pay has been suspended because the member has been determined to be missing, the Secretary concerned may determine for purposes of this subchapter that the member is presumed dead. Any such determination shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed under section 1444(a) of this title . The Secretary concerned may not make a determination for purposes of this subchapter that a member is presumed dead unless he finds

(A) that the member has been missing for at least 30 days; and

(B) that the circumstances under which the member is missing would lead a reasonably prudent person to conclude that the member is dead.

(2) Upon a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to a member, an annuity otherwise payable under this subchapter shall be paid as if the member died on the date as of which the retired or retainer pay of the member was suspended.
