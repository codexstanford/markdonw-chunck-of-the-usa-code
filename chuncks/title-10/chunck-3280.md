#### § 1592. Prohibition on payment of severance pay to foreign nationals in the event of certain overseas base closures

Funds available to the Department of Defense (including funds in the Foreign National Employees Separation Pay Account, Defense, established under section 1581 of this title ) may not be used to pay severance pay to a foreign national employed by the Department of Defense under a contract, a treaty, or a memorandum of understanding with a foreign nation that provides for payment of separation pay if the termination of the employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment of activities at, a United States military facility in that country at the request of the government of that country.
