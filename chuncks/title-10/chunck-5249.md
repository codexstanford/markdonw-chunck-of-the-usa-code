#### § 2902. Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program Council
###### (e) In carrying out subsection (d)(1), the Council shall prescribe policies and procedures that

(1) provide for appropriate access by Federal Government personnel, State and local government personnel, college and university personnel, industry personnel, and the general public to data under the control of, or otherwise available to, the Department of Defense that is relevant to environmental matters by

(A) identifying the sources of such data;

(B) publicizing the availability and sources of such data by appropriately-targeted dissemination of information to such personnel and the general public, and by other means; and

(C) providing for review of classified data relevant to environmental matters with a view to declassifying or preparing unclassified summaries of such data;

(2) provide governmental and nongovernmental entities with analytic assistance, consistent with national defense missions, including access to military platforms for sensor deployment and access to computer capabilities, in order to facilitate environmental research;

(3) provide for the identification of energy technologies developed for national defense purposes (including electricity generation systems, energy storage systems, alternative fuels, biomass energy technology, and applied materials technology) that might have environmentally sound, energy efficient applications for other programs of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy national security programs;

(4) provide for the identification and support of programs of basic and applied research, development, and demonstration in technologies useful

(A) to facilitate environmental compliance, remediation, and restoration activities of the Department of Defense and at Department of Energy defense facilities;

(B) to minimize waste generation, including reduction at the source, by such departments; or

(C) to substitute use of nonhazardous, nontoxic, nonpolluting, and other environmentally sound materials and substances for use of hazardous, toxic, and polluting materials and substances by such departments;

(5) provide for the identification and support of research, development, and application of other technologies developed for national defense purposes which not only are directly useful for programs, projects, and activities of such departments, but also have useful applications for solutions to such national and international environmental problems as climate change and ozone depletion;

(6) provide for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with other Federal and State agencies, as appropriate, to conduct joint research, development, and demonstration projects relating to innovative technologies, management practices, and other approaches for purposes of

(A) preventing pollution from all sources;

(B) minimizing hazardous and solid waste, including recycling; and

(C) treating hazardous and solid waste, including the use of thermal, chemical, and biological treatment technologies;

(7) encourage transfer of technologies referred to in clauses (2) through (6) to the private sector under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 ( 15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) and other applicable laws;

(8) provide for the identification of, and planning for the demonstration and use of, existing environmentally sound, energy-efficient technologies developed by the private sector that could be used directly by the Department of Defense;

(9) provide for the identification of military specifications that prevent or limit the use of environmentally beneficial technologies, materials, and substances in the performance of Department of Defense contracts and recommend changes to such specifications; and

(10) to ensure that the research and development programs identified for support pursuant to the policies and procedures prescribed by the Council are closely coordinated with, and do not duplicate, ongoing activities sponsored by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or other Federal agencies.

(f) The Council shall be subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense in prescribing policies and procedures under subsection (d)(1).

(g) Not later than February 1 of each year, the Council shall submit to the Secretary of Defense the annual report prepared pursuant to subsection (d)(3).
