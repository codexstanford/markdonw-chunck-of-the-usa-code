###### (b) Conversion Health Policies .

(1) The Secretary of Defense shall inform each member referred to in subsection (a) before the date of the member’s discharge or release from active service of the availability for purchase by the member of a conversion health policy for the member and the dependents of that member. A conversion health policy offered under this paragraph shall provide coverage for not less than an 18-month period.

(2) If a member referred to in subsection (a) purchases a conversion health policy during the period applicable to the member (or within a reasonable time after that period as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense), the Secretary shall provide health care, or pay the costs of health care provided, to the member and the dependents of the member

(A) during the 18-month period beginning on the date on which coverage under the conversion health policy begins; and

(B) for a condition (including pregnancy) that exists on such date and for which care is not provided under the policy solely on the grounds that the condition is a preexisting condition.

(3) The Secretary of Defense may arrange for the provision of health care described in paragraph (2) through a contract with the insurer offering the conversion health policy.

(4) If the Secretary of Defense is unable, within a reasonable time, to enter into a contract with a private insurer to provide the conversion health policy required under paragraph (1) at a rate not to exceed the payment required under section 8905a(d)(1)(A) of title 5 for comparable coverage, the Secretary shall offer such a policy under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. Subject to paragraph (5), a member purchasing a policy from the Secretary shall be required to pay into the Military Health Care Account or other appropriate account an amount equal to the sum of

(A) the individual and Government contributions which would be required in the case of a person enrolled in a health benefits plan contracted for under section 1079 of this title ; and

(B) an amount necessary for administrative expenses, but not to exceed two percent of the amount under subparagraph (A).

(5) The amount paid by a member who purchases a conversion health policy from the Secretary of Defense under paragraph (4) may not exceed the payment required under section 8905a(d)(1)(A) of title 5 for comparable coverage.

(6) In order to reduce premiums required under paragraph (4), the Secretary of Defense may offer a conversion health policy that, with respect to mental health services, offers reduced coverage and increased cost-sharing by the purchaser.
