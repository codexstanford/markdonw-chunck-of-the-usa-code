# Title 10— ARMED FORCES
## Subtitle A— General Military Law
### CHAPTER 47A— MILITARY COMMISSIONS
#### § 948b. Military commissions generally
###### (c) Construction of Provisions .

The procedures for military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial construction and application of chapter 47 of this title, while instructive, is therefore not of its own force binding on military commissions established under this chapter.
