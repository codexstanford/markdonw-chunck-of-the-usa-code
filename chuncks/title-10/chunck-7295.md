(1) In a contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement under subsection (a) or a lease under subsection (d), the Secretary of the Navy may authorize, consistent with section 2260 (other than subsection (d)) of this title, a partner organization to enter into licensing, marketing, and sponsorship agreements relating to Navy indicators, including the manufacture and sale of merchandise for sale by the museum, subject to the approval of the Department of the Navy.
