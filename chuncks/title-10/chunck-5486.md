If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with chapter 11 of title 40.

(2) Solicitation of phase-one proposals .

The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that

(A) include information on the offeror’s

(i) technical approach; and

(ii) technical qualifications; and

(i) detailed design information; or

(ii) cost or price information.

(3) Evaluation factors.

(A) Evaluation factors to be used .

The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include

(i) specialized experience and technical competence;
