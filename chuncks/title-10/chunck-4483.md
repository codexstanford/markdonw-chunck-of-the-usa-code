(1) In providing for the adoption under this section of a retired military working dog described in paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a), the Secretary of the military department concerned shall accord a preference to the former handler of the dog unless the Secretary determines that adoption of the dog by the former handler would not be in the best interests of the dog.

(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as altering, revising, or overriding any policy of a military department for the transfer of military working dogs to law enforcement agencies before the end of the dogs’ useful working lives.
