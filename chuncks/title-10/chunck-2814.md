(2) Change from conditional retirement grade .

If the resolution of an investigation or personnel action with respect to an officer who has been retired in a conditional retirement grade pursuant to subsection (d) results in a determination that the conditional retirement grade in which the officer was retired should be changed, the changed retirement grade shall be the final retired grade of the officer under this section, except that if the final retirement grade provided for an officer pursuant to this paragraph is the grade of lieutenant general or general in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps, vice admiral or admiral in the Navy, or an equivalent grade in the Space Force, the requirements in subsection (c) shall apply in connection with the retirement of the officer in such final retirement grade.

(3) Recalculation of retired pay.

(A) In general .

If the final retired grade of an officer is as a result of a change under paragraph (2), the retired pay of the officer under chapter 71 of this title shall be recalculated accordingly, with any modification of the retired pay of the officer to go into effect as of the date of the retirement of the officer.

(B) Payment of higher amount for period of conditional retirement grade .

For an officer whose retired grade is determined pursuant to subsection (c), the effective date of the change of the officer’s retired grade for purposes of this subparagraph shall be the date that is 60 days after the date on which the Secretary of Defense submits to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives the certification required by subsection (c) in connection with the retired grade of the officer.

(C) Recoupment of overage during period of conditional retirement grade .
