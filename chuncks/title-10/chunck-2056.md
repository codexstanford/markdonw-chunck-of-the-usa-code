The remedies and rights provided under this section are in addition to and do not preclude any remedy otherwise available under law to the person claiming relief under this section, including any award for consequential and punitive damages.

Notwithstanding section 2 of title 9 , or any other Federal or State law, rule, or regulation, no agreement to arbitrate any dispute involving the extension of consumer credit shall be enforceable against any covered member or dependent of such a member, or any person who was a covered member or dependent of that member when the agreement was made.

(5) Civil liability.

(A) In general .

A person who violates this section with respect to any person is civilly liable to such person for

(i) any actual damage sustained as a result, but not less than $500 for each violation;

(ii) appropriate punitive damages;

(iii) appropriate equitable or declaratory relief; and

(iv) any other relief provided by law.

In any successful action to enforce the civil liability described in subparagraph (A), the person who violated this section is also liable for the costs of the action, together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.

(C) Effect of finding of bad faith and harassment .
