#### § 3069. Buy-to-budget acquisition: end items
###### (a) Authority To Acquire Additional End Items .

Using funds available to the Department of Defense for the acquisition of an end item, the head of an agency making the acquisition may acquire a higher quantity of the end item than the quantity specified for the end item in a law providing for the funding of that acquisition if that head of an agency makes each of the following findings:

(1) The agency has an established requirement for the end item that is expected to remain substantially unchanged throughout the period of the acquisition.

(2) It is possible to acquire the higher quantity of the end item without additional funding because of production efficiencies or other cost reductions.

(3) The amount of the funds used for the acquisition of the higher quantity of the end item will not exceed the amount provided under that law for the acquisition of the end item.

(4) The amount so provided is sufficient to ensure that each unit of the end item acquired within the higher quantity is fully funded as a complete end item.
