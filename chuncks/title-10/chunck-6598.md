#### § 7274. Medal of honor; distinguished-service cross; distinguished-service medal: limitations on award
###### (c) If the Secretary of the Army determines that

(1) a statement setting forth the distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made and supported by sufficient evidence within three years after the distinguished service; and

(2) no award was made, because the statement was lost or through inadvertence the recommendation was not acted on; a medal of honor, distinguished-service cross, distinguished-service medal, or device in place thereof, as the case may be, may be awarded to the person concerned within two years after the date of that determination.
