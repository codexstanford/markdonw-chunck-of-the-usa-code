Notwithstanding the amount of the uniform surcharge assessed in subsection (d), the Secretary may provide for an alternative surcharge of not more than five percent of sales proceeds under the variable pricing program to be made available for the purposes specified in subsection (h).

(2) Subject to subsection (k), before establishing a variable pricing program under this subsection, the Secretary shall establish the following:

(A) Specific, measurable benchmarks for success in the provision of high quality grocery merchandise, discount savings to patrons, and levels of customer satisfaction while achieving savings for the Department of Defense.

(B) A baseline of overall savings to patrons achieved by commissary stores prior to the initiation of the variable pricing program, based on a comparison of prices charged by those stores on a regional basis with prices charged by relevant local competitors for a representative market basket of goods.

(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the defense commissary system implements the variable pricing program by conducting price comparisons using the methodology established for paragraph (2)(B) and adjusting pricing as necessary to ensure that pricing in the variable pricing program achieves overall savings to patrons that are consistent with the baseline savings established for the relevant region pursuant to such paragraph.
