While a member of a reserve component is covered by TRICARE Retired Reserve under this section, the members of the immediate family of such member are eligible for TRICARE Retired Reserve coverage as dependents of the member. If a member of a reserve component dies while in a period of coverage under this section, the eligibility of the members of the immediate family of such member for TRICARE Retired Reserve coverage under this section shall continue for the same period of time that would be provided under section 1086 of this title if the member had been eligible at the time of death for TRICARE coverage under such section (instead of under this section).
