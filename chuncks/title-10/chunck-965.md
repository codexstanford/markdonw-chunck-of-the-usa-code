###### (b) Reports .

(1) From time to time as the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff determine useful for the effective oversight of the access by the Department to electromagnetic spectrum, but not less frequently than every two years, the Secretary and the Chairman shall jointly submit to the congressional defense committees a report on national policy plans regarding implications for such access in bands identified for study for potential reallocation, or under consideration for potential reallocation, by the Policy and Plans Steering Group established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.

(2) Each report under paragraph (1) shall address, with respect to the electromagnetic spectrum used by the Department that is covered by the report, the implications to the missions of the Department resulting from sharing, reassigning, or reallocating the spectrum, or relocating the uses by the Department of such spectrum, if the Secretary and the Chairman jointly determine that such sharing, reassigning, reallocating, or relocation

(A) would potentially create a loss of essential military capability to the missions of the Department, as determined under feasibility assessments to ensure comparable capability; or

(B) would not likely be possible within the 10-year period beginning on the date of the report.
