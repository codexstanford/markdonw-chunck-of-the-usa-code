#### § 3784. Technical data under contracts for commercial items: presumption of development exclusively at private expense

In the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to technical data of a contractor or subcontractor under a contract for commercial products, the contracting officer shall presume that the contractor or subcontractor has justified the restriction on the basis that the commercial product was developed exclusively at private expense, whether or not the contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to the notice provided pursuant to section 3782(c) of this title . In such a case, the challenge to the use or release restriction may be sustained only if information provided by the Department of Defense demonstrates that the commercial product was not developed exclusively at private expense.
