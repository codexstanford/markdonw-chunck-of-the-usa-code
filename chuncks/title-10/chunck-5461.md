In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, the head of an agency

(B) shall (except as provided in paragraph (3)) include cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of proposals; and

(C) shall disclose to offerors whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are

(i) significantly more important than cost or price;

(ii) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or

(iii) significantly less important than cost or price.

(2) Restriction on implementing regulations .

The regulations implementing paragraph (1)(C) may not define the terms “significantly more important” and “significantly less important” as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.

(3) Exceptions for certain multiple task or delivery order contracts .

If the head of an agency issues a solicitation for multiple task or delivery order contracts under section 3403(d)(1)(B) of this title for the same or similar services and intends to make a contract award to each qualifying offeror

(A) cost or price to the Federal Government need not, at the Government’s discretion, be considered under paragraph (1)(B) as an evaluation factor for the contract award; and

(B) if, pursuant to subparagraph (A), cost or price to the Federal Government is not considered as an evaluation factor for the contract award

(i) the disclosure requirement of paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply; and

(ii) cost or price to the Federal Government shall be considered in conjunction with the issuance pursuant to section 3406(c) of this title of a task or delivery order under any contract resulting from the solicitation.

(4) Definition .

In paragraph (3), the term “qualifying offeror” means an offeror that

(A) is determined to be a responsible source;

(B) submits a proposal that conforms to the requirements of the solicitation; and

(C) the contracting officer has no reason to believe would likely offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.

(5) Exclusion of applicability to certain contracts .

Paragraph (3) shall not apply to multiple task or delivery order contracts if the solicitation provides for sole source task or delivery order contracts pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637(a) ).
