###### (c) Reduction for Insurable Interest Coverage.

(1) Required reduction in retired pay .

The retired pay, other than retired pay received as a lump sum under section 1415(b)(1)(A) of this title , of a person who has elected to provide an annuity to a person designated by him under section 1450(a)(5) of this title shall be reduced as follows:

(A) Standard annuity .

In the case of a person providing a standard annuity, the reduction shall be by 10 percent plus 5 percent for each full five years the individual designated is younger than that person.

(B) Reserve component annuity .

In the case of a person providing a reserve-component annuity, the reduction shall be by an amount prescribed under regulations of the Secretary of Defense.

(2) Limitation on total reduction .

The total reduction under paragraph (1) may not exceed 40 percent.

(3) Duration of reduction .

The reduction in retired pay prescribed by this subsection shall continue during the lifetime of the person designated under section 1450(a)(5) of this title or until the person receiving retired pay changes his election under section 1450(f) of this title .

(4) Rule for computation .

Computation of a member’s retired pay for purposes of this subsection shall be made without regard to any reduction under section 1409(b)(2) or 1415(b)(1)(B) of this title.

(5) Rule for designation of new insurable interest beneficiary following death of original beneficiary .

The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe in regulations premiums which a participant making an election under section 1448(b)(1)(G) of this title shall be required to pay for participating in the Plan pursuant to that election. The total amount of the premiums to be paid by a participant under the regulations shall be equal to the sum of the following:

(A) The total additional amount by which the retired pay of the participant would have been reduced before the effective date of the election if the original beneficiary (i) had not died and had been covered under the Plan through the date of the election, and (ii) had been the same number of years younger than the participant (if any) as the new beneficiary designated under the election.

(B) Interest on the amounts by which the retired pay of the participant would have been so reduced, computed from the dates on which the retired pay would have been so reduced at such rate or rates and according to such methodology as the Secretary of Defense determines reasonable.

(C) Any additional amount that the Secretary determines necessary to protect the actuarial soundness of the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund against any increased risk for the fund that is associated with the election.
