The military judge shall hold a hearing on any motion under this subsection. Any such hearing shall be held in camera at the request of a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to classify information.

(4) Submission of statement of damage to national security if disclosure ordered .

If so requested by the trial counsel, the military judge shall examine such declaration during an ex parte presentation.
