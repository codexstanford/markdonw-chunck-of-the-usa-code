#### § 2911. Energy policy of the Department of Defense
###### (e) Special Considerations .

For the purpose of developing and implementing the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan, the Secretary of Defense shall consider at a minimum the following:

(1) Opportunities to reduce the current rate of consumption of energy, the future demand for energy, and the requirement for the use of energy.

(2) Opportunities to enhance energy resilience to ensure the Department of Defense has the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that affect mission assurance on military installations.

(3) Opportunities to implement conservation measures to improve the efficient use of energy.

(4) Opportunities to pursue alternative energy initiatives, including the use of alternative fuels and hybrid-electric drive in military vehicles and equipment.

(5) Opportunities for the high-performance construction, lease, operation, and maintenance of buildings.

(6) Cost effectiveness, cost savings, and net present value of alternatives.

(7) The value of diversification of types and sources of energy used.

(8) The value of economies-of-scale associated with fewer energy types used.

(9) The value of the use of renewable energy sources.

(10) The value of incorporating electric, hybrid-electric, and high efficiency vehicles into vehicle fleets.

(11) The potential for an action to serve as an incentive for members of the armed forces and civilian personnel to reduce energy consumption or adopt an improved energy performance measure.

(12) Opportunities for improving energy security for facility energy projects that will use renewable energy sources.

(13) Opportunities to leverage financing provided by a non-Department entity to address installation energy needs.

(14) The reliability and security of energy resources in the event of a military conflict.

(15) The value of resourcing energy from partners and allies of the United States.
