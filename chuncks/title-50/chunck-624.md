### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2032. Annuities for former spouses
##### (c) Optional additional survivor annuities for other former spouse or surviving spouse

(1) In general

In the case of any participant providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) for a former spouse

(A) such participant may elect, or

(B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title may provide for, an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as prescribed by the Director.

(2) Limitation

Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under this subsection with respect to any participant, nor the survivor annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of such participant under this section or section 2031 of this title , may exceed 55 percent of the unreduced amount of the participant’s annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of this title .

(3) Contribution for additional annuities

(A) Provision of additional survivor annuity

In accordance with regulations which the Director shall prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity under this subsection

(i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the basic pay of the participant;

(ii) by a lump-sum payment or installment payments to the fund; or

(iii) by any combination thereof.

(B) Actuarial equivalence to benefit

The present value of the total amount to accrue to the fund under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the Director.

(C) Effect of former spouse’s death or disqualification

If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries before attaining age 55 (or, in the case of a spouse, the spouse predeceases the participant or does not qualify as a former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage)

(i) if an annuity reduction or pay allotment under subparagraph (A) is in effect for that spouse or former spouse, the annuity shall be recomputed and paid as if it had not been reduced or the pay allotment terminated, as the case may be; and

(ii) any amount accruing to the fund under subparagraph (A) shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits under this subsection for the period such benefits were provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Director.

(D) Recomputation upon death or remarriage of former spouse

Under regulations prescribed by the Director, an annuity shall be recomputed (or a pay allotment terminated or adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55 and an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance with this section.

(4) Commencement and termination of additional survivor annuity

An annuity payable under this subsection to a spouse or former spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the spouse’s or the former spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 55.

(5) Nonapplicability of COLA provision

Section 2131 of this title does not apply to an annuity under this subsection, unless authorized under regulations prescribed by the Director.
