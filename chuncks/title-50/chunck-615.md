### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2031. Computation of annuities
##### (g) Effect of divorce after retirement

(1) Recomputation of retired participant’s annuity upon divorce

An annuity which is reduced under this section (or any similar prior provision of law) to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse shall, if the marriage of the retired participant to such spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month during which a retired participant is not married (or is remarried, if there is no election in effect under paragraph (2)) as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any reduction required to provide a survivor annuity under subsection (b) or (c) of section 2032 of this title or under section 2036 of this title .

(2) Election of survivor annuity upon subsequent remarriage

(A) In general

Upon remarriage, the retired participant may irrevocably elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Director within two years after such remarriage, to receive a reduced annuity for the purpose of providing an annuity for the new spouse of the retired participant in the event such spouse survives the retired participant. Such reduction shall be equal to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted under section 2032(b)(5) of this title or elected under subparagraph (B)).

(B) When annuity previously not (or not fully) reduced

(i) Election

If the retired participant’s annuity was not reduced (or was not fully reduced) to provide a survivor annuity for the participant’s spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement, the retired participant may make an election under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) upon remarriage to a spouse other than the spouse at the time of retirement. For any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991 , the retired participant may make such an election within 2 years after such date.

(ii) Deposit required

(I) The retired participant shall, within two years after the date of the remarriage (or by August 14, 1993 for any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991 ), deposit in the fund an amount determined by the Director, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired participant’s annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest.

(II) The annual rate of interest for each year during which the retired participant’s annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.

(III) If the retired participant does not make the deposit, the Director shall collect such amount by offset against the participant’s annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to the retired participant, and the retired participant is deemed to consent to such offset.

(IV) The deposit required by this subparagraph may be made by the surviving spouse of the retired participant.

(C) Effects of election

An election under this paragraph and the reduction in the participant’s annuity shall be effective on the first day of the month beginning 9 months after the date of remarriage. A survivor annuity elected under this paragraph shall be treated in all respects as a survivor annuity under subsection (b).
