#### § 1521. Destruction of existing stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions
##### (n) Incentive clauses in chemical demilitarization contracts

(1)

(A) The Secretary of Defense may, for the purpose specified in paragraph (B), authorize the inclusion of an incentives clause in any contract for the destruction of the United States stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions carried out pursuant to subsection (a).

(B) The purpose of a clause referred to in subparagraph (A) is to provide the contractor for a chemical demilitarization facility an incentive to accelerate the safe elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile and to reduce the total cost of the Chemical Demilitarization Program by providing incentive payments for the early completion of destruction operations and the closure of such facility.

(2)

(A) An incentives clause under this subsection shall permit the contractor for the chemical demilitarization facility concerned the opportunity to earn incentive payments for the completion of destruction operations and facility closure activities within target incentive ranges specified in such clause.

(B) The maximum incentive payment under an incentives clause with respect to a chemical demilitarization facility may not exceed the following amounts:

(i) In the case of an incentive payment for the completion of destruction operations within the target incentive range specified in such clause, $110,000,000.

(ii) In the case of an incentive payment for the completion of facility closure activities within the target incentive range specified in such clause, $55,000,000.

(C) An incentives clause in a contract under this section shall specify the target incentive ranges of costs for completion of destruction operations and facility closure activities, respectively, as jointly agreed upon by the contracting officer and the contractor concerned. An incentives clause shall require a proportionate reduction in the maximum incentive payment amounts in the event that the contractor exceeds an agreed-upon target cost if such excess costs are the responsibility of the contractor.

(D) The amount of the incentive payment earned by a contractor for a chemical demilitarization facility under an incentives clause under this subsection shall be based upon a determination by the Secretary on how early in the target incentive range specified in such clause destruction operations or facility closure activities, as the case may be, are completed.

(E) The provisions of any incentives clause under this subsection shall be consistent with the obligation of the Secretary of Defense under subsection (d)(1)(A), to provide for maximum protection for the environment, the general public, and the personnel who are involved in the destruction of the lethal chemical agents and munitions.

(F) In negotiating the inclusion of an incentives clause in a contract under this subsection, the Secretary may include in such clause such additional terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate.

(3)

(A) No payment may be made under an incentives clause under this subsection unless the Secretary determines that the contractor concerned has satisfactorily performed its duties under such incentives clause.

(B) An incentives clause under this subsection shall specify that the obligation of the Government to make payment under such incentives clause is subject to the availability of appropriations for that purpose. Amounts appropriated for Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction, Defense, shall be available for payments under incentives clauses under this subsection.
