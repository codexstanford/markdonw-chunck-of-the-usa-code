### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2031. Computation of annuities
##### (b) Spouse or former spouse survivor annuity

(1) Reduction in participant’s annuity to provide spouse or former spouse survivor annuity

(A) General rule

Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 55), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for the participant’s spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title , or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.

(B) Joint election for waiver or reduction of spouse survivor annuity

A married participant or former participant and the participant’s spouse may jointly elect in writing at the time of retirement to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor annuity. If the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant’s annuity designated under this subparagraph.

(C) Joint election of participant and former spouse

If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, such participant and the participant’s former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 2094(b) of this title to waive, reduce, or increase a survivor annuity under section 2032(b) of this title for that former spouse. Any such election must be made (i) before the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date on which the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final, or (ii) at the time of retirement of the participant, whichever is later.

(D) Unilateral elections in absence of spouse or former spouse

The Director may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant’s spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.

(2) Amount of reduction in participant’s annuity

The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity under this section (or section 2032(b) of this title ), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 2½ percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 2032(a)(5) of this title .

(3) Amount of surviving spouse annuity

(A) In general

If a retired participant receiving a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse. The amount of the annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of (i) the full amount of the participant’s annuity computed under subsection (a), or (ii) any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor annuity under paragraph (1)(B).

(B) Limitation

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the retired participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor annuities which remains available under section 2032(b)(4)(B) of this title .

(C) Effective date and termination of annuity

An annuity payable from the fund to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the retired participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.
