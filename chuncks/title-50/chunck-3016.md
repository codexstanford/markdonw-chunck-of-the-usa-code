(E) a foreign corporation or association which at any time after December 7, 1941 , was controlled or 50 per centum or more of the stock of which was owned by any person or persons ineligible to receive a return under subdivisions (A), (B), (C), or (D) hereof: Provided , That notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision (E), return may be made to a corporation or association so controlled or owned, if such corporation or association was organized under the laws of a nation any of whose territory was occupied by the military or naval forces of any nation with which the United States has at any time since December 7, 1941 , been at war, and if such control or ownership arose after March 1, 1938 , as an incident to such occupation and was terminated prior to March 8, 1946 ; and

(3) that the property or interest claimed, or the net proceeds of which are claimed, was not at any time after September 1, 1939 , held or used, by or with the assent of the person who was the owner thereof immediately prior to vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian, pursuant to any arrangement to conceal any property or interest within the United States of any person ineligible to receive a return under subsection (a)(2) hereof;
