#### § 2911. Proliferation Security Initiative improvements and authorities
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress, consistent with the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations, that the President should strive to expand and strengthen the Proliferation Security Initiative (in this subchapter referred to as “PSI”) announced by the President on May 31, 2003 , with a particular emphasis on the following:

(1) Issuing a presidential directive to the relevant United States Government agencies and departments that directs such agencies and departments to

(A) establish clear PSI authorities, responsibilities, and structures;

(B) include in the budget request for each such agency or department for each fiscal year, a request for funds necessary for United States PSI-related activities; and

(C) provide other necessary resources to achieve more efficient and effective performance of United States PSI-related activities.

(2) Increasing PSI cooperation with all countries.

(3) Implementing the recommendations of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the September 2006 report titled “Better Controls Needed to Plan and Manage Proliferation Security Initiative Activities” (GAO–06–937C) regarding the following:

(A) The Department of Defense and the Department of State should establish clear PSI roles and responsibilities, policies and procedures, interagency communication mechanisms, documentation requirements, and indicators to measure program results.

(B) The Department of Defense and the Department of State should develop a strategy to work with PSI-participating countries to resolve issues that are impediments to conducting successful PSI interdictions.

(4) Establishing a multilateral mechanism to increase coordination, cooperation, and compliance among PSI-participating countries.
