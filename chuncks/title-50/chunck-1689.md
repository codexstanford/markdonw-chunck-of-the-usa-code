#### § 3099. Vulnerability assessments of major systems
##### (a) Initial vulnerability assessments
######## (C) The initial vulnerability assessment of a major system and its significant items of supply shall include use of an analysis-based approach to

(i) identify vulnerabilities;

(ii) define exploitation potential;

(iii) examine the system’s potential effectiveness;

(iv) determine overall vulnerability; and

(v) make recommendations for risk reduction.

(2) If an initial vulnerability assessment for a major system is not submitted to the congressional intelligence committees as required by paragraph (1), funds appropriated for the acquisition of the major system may not be obligated for a major contract related to the major system. Such prohibition on the obligation of funds for the acquisition of the major system shall cease to apply on the date on which the congressional intelligence committees receive the initial vulnerability assessment.
