### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2082. Prior service credit
##### (f) Effect of entitlement to social security benefits

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except paragraph (3) of this subsection) or section 2083 of this title , any military service (other than military service covered by military leave with pay from a civilian position) performed by a participant after December 1956 shall be excluded in determining the aggregate period of service on which an annuity payable under this subchapter to such participant or to the participant’s spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is based, if such participant, spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled), at the time of such determination, to monthly old-age or survivors’ insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42 , based on such participant’s wages and self-employment income. If the military service is not excluded under the preceding sentence, but upon attaining age 62, the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse becomes entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the aggregate period of service on which the annuity is based shall be redetermined, effective as of the first day of the month in which the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse attains age 62, so as to exclude such service.

(2) Limitation

The provisions of paragraph (1) relating to credit for military service do not apply to

(A) any period of military service of a participant with respect to which the participant has made a deposit with interest, if any, under subsection (h); or

(B) the military service of any participant described in subsection (e)(2)(B).

(3) Effect of entitlement before September 8, 1982

(A) The annuity recomputation required by paragraph (1) shall not apply to any participant who was entitled to an annuity under this subchapter on or before September 8, 1982 , or who is entitled to a deferred annuity based on separation from the Agency occurring on or before such date. Instead of an annuity recomputation, the annuity of such participant shall be reduced at age 62 by an amount equal to a fraction of the participant’s old-age or survivors’ insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42 . The reduction shall be determined by multiplying the participant’s monthly Social Security benefit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant’s total military wages and deemed additional wages (within the meaning of section 429 of title 42 ) that were subject to Social Security deductions and the denominator of which is the total of all the participant’s wages, including military wages, and all self-employment income that were subject to Social Security deductions before the calendar year in which the determination month occurs.

(B) The reduction determined in accordance with subparagraph (A) shall not be greater than the reduction that would be required under paragraph (1) if such paragraph applied to the participant. The new formula shall be applicable to any annuity payment payable after October 1, 1982 , including annuity payments to participants who had previously reached age 62 and whose annuities had already been recomputed.

(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “determination month” means

(i) the first month for which the participant is entitled to old-age or survivors’ insurance benefits (or would be entitled to such benefits upon application therefor); or

(ii) October 1982, in the case of any participant entitled to such benefits for that month.
