### CHAPTER 49— MILITARY SELECTIVE SERVICE
#### § 3812. Nonapplicability of certain laws
##### (b) Administrative Procedure Act

All functions performed under this chapter shall be excluded from the operation of the Administrative Procedure Act ( 60 Stat. 237 ) [ 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.] except as to the requirements of section 3 of such Act [ 5 U.S.C. 552 ]. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no regulation issued under this Act shall become effective until the expiration of thirty days following the date on which such regulation has been published in the Federal Register. After the publication of any regulation and prior to the date on which such regulation becomes effective, any person shall be given an opportunity to submit his views to the Director on such regulation, but no formal hearing shall be required on any such regulation. The requirements of this subsection may be waived by the President in the case of any regulation if he (1) determines that compliance with such requirements would materially impair the national defense, and (2) gives public notice to that effect at the time such regulation is issued.
