#### § 2031. Computation of annuities
##### (f) Participants not married at time of retirement

(1) Designation of persons with insurable interest

(A) Authority to make designation

Subject to the rights of former spouses under subsection (b) of this section and section 2032 of this title , at the time of retirement an unmarried participant found by the Director to be in good health may elect to receive an annuity reduced in accordance with subparagraph (B) and designate in writing an individual having an insurable interest in the participant to receive an annuity under the system after the participant’s death. The amount of such an annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the participant’s reduced annuity.

(B) Reduction in participant’s annuity

The annuity payable to the participant making such election shall be reduced by 10 percent of an annuity computed under subsection (a) and by an additional 5 percent for each full 5 years the designated individual is younger than the participant. The total reduction under this subparagraph may not exceed 40 percent.

(C) Commencement of survivor annuity

The annuity payable to the designated individual shall begin on the day after the retired participant dies and terminate on the last day of the month before the designated individual dies.

(D) Recomputation of participant’s annuity on death of designated individual

An annuity which is reduced under this paragraph shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the designated individual, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced.

(2) Election of survivor annuity upon subsequent marriage

A participant who is unmarried at the time of retirement and who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received by the Director within two years after the marriage, to receive a reduced annuity as provided in subsection (b). Such election and reduction shall be effective on the first day of the month beginning 9 months after the date of marriage. The election voids prospectively any election previously made under paragraph (1).
