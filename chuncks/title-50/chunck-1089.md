### CHAPTER 42— ATOMIC ENERGY DEFENSE PROVISIONS
#### § 2586a. Other programs relating to technology development
##### (b) High-Impact Technology Development Program

(1) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a program, to be known as the “High-Impact Technology Development Program”, under which the Secretary shall enter into agreements with nongovernmental entities for projects that pursue technologies that, with respect to the mission

(A) holistically address difficult challenges;

(B) hold the promise of breakthrough improvements; or

(C) align existing or in-use technologies with difficult challenges.

(2) Areas of focus

The Secretary may include as areas of focus for a project carried out under the High-Impact Technology Development Program the following:

(A) Developing and demonstrating improved methods for source and plume characterization and monitoring, with an emphasis on

(i) real-time field acquisition; and

(ii) the use of indicator species analyses with advanced contaminant transport models to enable better understanding of contaminant migration.

(B) Developing and determining the limits of performance for remediation technologies and integrated remedial systems that prevent migration of contaminants, including by producing associated guidance and design manuals for technologies that could be widely used across the complex.

(C) Demonstrating advanced monitoring approaches that use multiple lines of evidence for monitoring long-term performance of

(i) remediation systems; and

(ii) noninvasive near-field monitoring techniques.

(D) Developing and demonstrating methods to characterize the physical and chemical attributes of waste that control behavior, with an emphasis on

(i) rapid and nondestructive examination and assay techniques; and

(ii) methods to determine radio-nuclide, heavy metals, and organic constituents.

(E) Demonstrating the technical basis for determining when enhanced or natural attenuation is an appropriate approach for remediation of complex sites.

(F) Developing and demonstrating innovative methods to achieve real-time and, if practicable, in situ characterization data for tank waste and process streams that could be useful for all phases of the waste management program, including improving the accuracy and representativeness of characterization data for residual waste in tanks and ancillary equipment.

(G) Adapting existing waste treatment technologies or demonstrating new waste treatment technologies at the pilot plant scale using real wastes or realistic surrogates

(i) to address engineering adaptations;

(ii) to ensure compliance with waste treatment standards and other applicable requirements under Federal and State law and any existing agreements or consent decrees to which the Department is a party; and

(iii) to enable successful deployment at full-scale and in support of operations.

(H) Developing and demonstrating rapid testing protocols that

(i) are accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department, and the scientific community;

(ii) can be used to measure long-term waste form performance under realistic disposal environments;

(iii) can determine whether a stabilized waste is suitable for disposal; and

(iv) reduce the need for extensive, time-consuming, and costly analyses on every batch of waste prior to disposal.

(I) Developing and demonstrating direct stabilization technologies to provide waste forms for disposing of elemental mercury.

(J) Developing and demonstrating innovative and effective retrieval methods for removal of waste residual materials from tanks and ancillary equipment, including mobile retrieval equipment or methods capable of immediately removing waste from leaking tanks, and connecting pipelines.

(3) Project selection

(A) Selection

The Secretary shall select projects to be carried out under the High-Impact Technology Development Program through a rigorous process that involves

(i) transparent and open competition; and

(ii) a review process that, if practicable, is conducted in an independent manner consistent with Department guidance on selecting and funding public-private partnerships.

(B) Briefing

Not later than 120 days before the date on which the Secretary enters into the first agreement under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide to the congressional defense committees a briefing on the process of selecting and funding efforts within the High-Impact Technology Development Program, including with respect to the plans of the Secretary to ensure a scientifically rigorous process that minimizes potential conflicts of interest.
