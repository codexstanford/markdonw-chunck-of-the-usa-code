### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2154. Special rules for former spouses
##### (d) Qualified former spouse survivor benefits

(1) Entitlement

(A) In general

Subject to an election under section 8416(a) of title 5 , and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order governing survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a qualified former spouse, such former spouse is entitled to a share, determined under subparagraph (B), of all survivor benefits that would otherwise be payable under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5 to an eligible surviving spouse of the employee.

(B) Amount of share

The share referred to in subparagraph (A) equals

(i) 100 percent, if the qualified former spouse was married to the employee throughout the entire period of the employee’s service which is creditable under chapter 84 of title 5; or

(ii) a pro rata share of 100 percent, if the qualified former spouse was not married to the employee throughout such creditable service.

(2) Survivor benefits

(A) The survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a qualified former spouse shall include the amount payable under section 8442(b)(1)(A) of title 5 and any supplementary annuity under section 8442(f) of such title that would be payable if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such section.

(B) Any calculation under section 8442(f) of title 5 of the supplementary annuity payable to a widow or widower of an employee referred to in section 2152(a) of this title shall be based on an “assumed CIARDS annuity” rather than an “assumed CSRS annuity” as stated in section 8442(f) of such title. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term “assumed CIARDS annuity” means the amount of the survivor annuity to which the widow or widower would be entitled under subchapter II of this chapter based on the service of the deceased annuitant determined under section 8442(f)(5) of such title.

(3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55

A qualified former spouse shall not be entitled to any benefit under this subsection if, before commencement of any benefit, the qualified former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.

(4) Restoration

If the survivor annuity payable under this subsection to a surviving qualified former spouse is terminated because of remarriage before becoming age 55, the annuity shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if

(A) such former spouse elects to receive this survivor annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which such former spouse may be entitled under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5, or under another retirement system for Government employees by reason of the remarriage; and

(B) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

(5) Modification of court order or spousal agreement

A modification in a court order or spousal agreement to adjust a qualified former spouse’s share of the survivor benefits shall not be effective if issued after the retirement or death of the employee, former employee, or annuitant, whichever occurs first.

(6) Effect of termination of qualified former spouse’s entitlement

After a qualified former spouse of a retired employee remarries before becoming age 55 or dies, the reduction in the retired employee’s annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for such former spouse shall be terminated. The annuitant may elect, in a signed writing received by the Director within 2 years after the qualified former spouse’s remarriage or death, to continue the reduction in order to provide or increase the survivor annuity for such annuitant’s spouse. The annuitant making such election shall pay a deposit in accordance with the provisions of section 8418 of title 5 .

(7) Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS

Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the share of such employee’s qualified former spouse to survivor benefits shall equal the sum of

(A) 50 percent of the employee’s annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title ), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service before the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service before such effective date; and

(B) if applicable

(i) 50 percent of the employee’s annuity under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title ), plus

(ii) the survivor benefits referred to in subsection (d)(2)(A), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service after such effective date.
