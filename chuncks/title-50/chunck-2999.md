All money and other property shall be held to be owned by the German Government (1) if no claim thereto has been filed with the Alien Property Custodian prior to the expiration of three years from March 10, 1928 , or (2) if any claim has been filed before the expiration of such period (whether before or after March 10, 1928 ), then if the ownership thereof under any such claim is not established by a decision of the Alien Property Custodian or by suit in court instituted, under section 4309 of this title , within one year after the decision of the Alien Property Custodian, or after March 10, 1928 , whichever date is later. The amounts so transferred under this subsection shall be credited upon the final payment due the United States from the German Government on account of the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission.
