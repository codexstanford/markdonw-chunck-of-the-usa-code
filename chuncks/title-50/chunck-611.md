The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under this subsection is the amount equal to the sum of the following:

(i) Additional cost to system

(I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity; and

(II) the costs associated with providing for the later election.

(5) Rights and obligations resulting from reduced annuity election

Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations that would have resulted had the participant involved elected such annuity at the time of retirement.
