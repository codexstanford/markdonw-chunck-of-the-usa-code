### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2051. Retirement for disability or incapacity; medical examination; recovery
##### (b) Computation of disability annuity

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), an annuity payable under subsection (a) shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title . However, if the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the system at the time of retirement, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the participant’s age at the time of retirement and age 60.

(2) Coordination with military retired pay and veterans’ compensation and pension

If a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 2082(e)(3) of this title ) or Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title , excluding credit for such military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532  1 of title 5, or the Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this section in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under section 2031(a) of this title .
