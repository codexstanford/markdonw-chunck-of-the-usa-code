### CHAPTER 58— EXPORT CONTROL REFORM
#### § 4817. Requirements to identify and control the export of emerging and foundational technologies
##### (c) Multilateral controls

(1) In general

The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall propose that any technology identified pursuant to subsection (a) be added to the list of technologies controlled by the relevant multilateral export control regimes.

(2) Items on commerce control list or United States munitions list

If the Secretary of State proposes to a multilateral export control regime under paragraph (1) to add a technology identified pursuant to subsection (a) to the control list of that regime and that regime does not add that technology to the control list during the 3-year period beginning on the date of the proposal, the applicable agency head may determine whether national security concerns warrant the continuation of unilateral export controls with respect to that technology.
