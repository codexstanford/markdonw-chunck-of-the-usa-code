### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2051. Retirement for disability or incapacity; medical examination; recovery
##### (f) Offset from survivor annuity for workers’ compensation payment

(1) Refund to Department of Labor

If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 of title 5 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department for credit to the Employees’ Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall

(A) refund to the Secretary of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or

(B) authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.

(2) Source of deduction

Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Secretary for reimbursement to the Employees’ Compensation Fund.

(3) Prorating deduction

If the Secretary finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.
