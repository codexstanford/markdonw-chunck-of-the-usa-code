### CHAPTER 10— HELIUM GAS
#### § 167o. Low-Btu gas separation and helium conservation
##### (b) Programs

(1) Membrane technology research

The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, shall support a civilian research program to develop advanced membrane technology that is used in the separation of low-Btu gases, including technologies that remove helium and other constituent gases that lower the Btu content of natural gas.

(2) Helium separation technology

The Secretary of Energy shall support a research program to develop technologies for separating, gathering, and processing helium in low concentrations that occur naturally in geological reservoirs or formations, including

(A) low-Btu gas production streams; and

(B) technologies that minimize the atmospheric venting of helium gas during natural gas production.

(3) Industrial helium program

The Secretary of Energy, working through the Advanced Manufacturing Office of the Department of Energy, shall carry out a research program

(A) to develop low-cost technologies and technology systems for recycling, reprocessing, and reusing helium for all medical, scientific, industrial, commercial, aerospace, and other uses of helium in the United States, including Federal uses; and

(B) to develop industrial gathering technologies to capture helium from other chemical processing, including ammonia processing.
