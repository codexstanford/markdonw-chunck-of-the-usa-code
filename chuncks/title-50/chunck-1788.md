#### § 3144. Operational files of the National Security Agency
##### (g) Decennial review of exempted operational files

(1) Not less than once every 10 years, the Director of the National Security Agency and the Director of National Intelligence shall review the exemptions in force under subsection (a) to determine whether such exemptions may be removed from a category of exempted files or any portion thereof. The Director of National Intelligence must approve any determination to remove such exemptions.

(2) The review required by paragraph (1) shall include consideration of the historical value or other public interest in the subject matter of a particular category of files or portions thereof and the potential for declassifying a significant part of the information contained therein.

(3) A complainant that alleges that the National Security Agency has improperly withheld records because of failure to comply with this subsection may seek judicial review in the district court of the United States of the district in which any of the parties reside, or in the District of Columbia. In such a proceeding, the court’s review shall be limited to determining the following:

(A) Whether the National Security Agency has conducted the review required by paragraph (1) before the expiration of the 10-year period beginning on November 24, 2003 , or before the expiration of the 10-year period beginning on the date of the most recent review.

(B) Whether the National Security Agency, in fact, considered the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) in conducting the required review.
