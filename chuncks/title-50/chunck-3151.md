(2) Announcement by the President

The President shall announce the decision on whether or not to take action pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect to a covered transaction not later than 15 days after the earlier of

(A) the date on which the investigation of the transaction under subsection (b) is completed; or

(B) the date on which the Committee otherwise refers the transaction to the President under subsection ( l )(2).

(3) Enforcement

The President may direct the Attorney General of the United States to seek appropriate relief, including divestment relief, in the district courts of the United States, in order to implement and enforce this subsection.

(4) Findings of the President

The President may exercise the authority conferred by paragraph (1), only if the President finds that

(B) provisions of law, other than this section and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act [ 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], do not, in the judgment of the President, provide adequate and appropriate authority for the President to protect the national security in the matter before the President.
