### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2032. Annuities for former spouses
##### (a) Former spouse share of participant’s annuity

(1) Pro rata share

Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title , a former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant is entitled to an annuity

(A) if married to the participant, former participant, or retired participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or

(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that proportion of 50 percent of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.

(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55

A former spouse is not qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.

(3) Commencement of annuity

The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or on the first day of the month after the divorce or annulment involved becomes final, whichever is later.

(4) Termination of annuity

The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on

(A) the last day of the month before the month in which the former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age; or

(B) the date on which the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).

(5) Treatment of participant’s annuity

(A) Reduction in participant’s annuity

The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating

(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this subchapter; and

(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) or under section 2031(b) of this title .

(B) Treatment when annuitant returns to service

If an annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 2111 of this title , or reinstated or reappointed, in the case of a recovered disability annuitant, or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under sections 2112 and 2113 of this title, the pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund.

(6) Disability annuitant

Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of a former spouse of a disability annuitant

(A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date on which the participant would qualify on the basis of the participant’s creditable service for an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) or the date on which the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and

(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.

(7) Election of benefits

A former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant shall not become entitled under this subsection to an annuity payable from the fund unless the former spouse elects to receive it instead of any survivor annuity to which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.

(8) Limitation in case of multiple former spouse annuities

No spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title involving a participant may provide for an annuity or a combination of annuities under this subsection that exceeds the annuity of the participant.
