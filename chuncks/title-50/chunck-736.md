The share referred to in subparagraph (A) equals

(i) 50 percent, if the qualified former spouse was married to the employee throughout the entire period of the employee’s service which is creditable under chapter 84 of title 50;  1 or

(ii) a pro rata share of 50 percent, if the qualified former spouse was not married to the employee throughout such creditable service.

(3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55

A qualified former spouse shall not be entitled to any benefit under this subsection if, before the commencement of any benefit, the qualified former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.

(4) Commencement and termination

(A) Commencement

The benefits of a qualified former spouse under this subsection commence on the later of

(i) the day on which the employee upon whose service the benefits are based becomes entitled to the benefits; or

(ii) the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Director receives written notice of the court order or spousal agreement, together with such additional information or documentation as the Director may prescribe.

(B) Termination

The benefits of the qualified former spouse and the right thereto terminate on

(i) the last day of the month before the qualified former spouse remarries before 55 years of age or dies; or

(ii) the date on which the retired employee’s benefits terminate (except in the case of benefits subject to paragraph (5)(B)).

(5) Payments to retired employees

(A) Calculation of survivor annuity

Any reduction in payments to a retired employee as a result of payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection shall be disregarded in calculating

(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse (qualified or otherwise), or other survivor under chapter 84 of title 5, and

(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the retired employee to provide survivor benefits under subsection (d) of this section or under sections  2 8442 or 8445 of title 5.

(B) Reduction in basic pay upon recall to service

If a retired employee whose annuity is reduced under paragraph (1) is recalled to service under section 2152(c) of this title , the basic pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

(6) Special rules for disability annuitants

Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4), in the case of any qualified former spouse of a disability annuitant

(A) the annuity of such former spouse shall commence on the date on which the employee would qualify, on the basis of the employee’s creditable service, for benefits under subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5 or on the date on which the disability annuity begins, whichever is later; and

(B) the amount of the annuity of the qualified former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the benefits for which the employee would otherwise qualify under subchapter II of chapter 84 of such title.

(7) Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS

Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the share of such employee’s qualified former spouse shall equal the sum of

(A) 50 percent of the employee’s annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title ), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service before the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service before such effective date; and

(B) if applicable, 50 percent of the employee’s benefits under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title ), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee’s creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee’s total creditable service after such effective date.

(8) Treatment of pro rata share under title 26

For purposes of title 26, payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection shall be treated as income to the qualified former spouse and not to the employee.
