### CHAPTER 38— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY
#### § 2082. Prior service credit
##### (b) Limitations

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the total service of any participant shall exclude

(A) any period of civilian service on or after October 1, 1982 , for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made,

(B) any period of service for which a refund of contributions has been made, or

(C) any period of service for which contributions were not transferred pursuant to subsection (c)(1); unless the participant makes a deposit to the fund in an amount equal to the percentages of basic pay received for such service as specified in the table contained in section 8334(c) of title 5 , together with interest computed in accordance with section 8334(e) of such title. The deposit may be made in one or more installments (including by allotment from pay), as determined by the Director.

(2) Effect of retirement deductions not made

If a participant has not paid a deposit for civilian service performed before October 1, 1982 , for which retirement deductions were not made, such participant’s annuity shall be reduced by 10 percent of the deposit described in paragraph (1) remaining unpaid, unless the participant elects to eliminate the service involved for the purpose of the annuity computation.

(3) Effect of refund of retirement contributions

A participant who received a refund of retirement contributions under this or any other retirement system for Government employees covering service for which the participant may be allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount received, with interest computed under paragraph (1). Credit may not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the deposit is made, except that a participant who

(A) separated from Government service before March 31, 1991 , and received a refund of the participant’s retirement contributions covering a period of service ending before March 31, 1991 ;

(B) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) which commences after December 1, 1992 ; and

(C) does not make the deposit required to receive credit for the service covered by the refund; shall be entitled to an annuity actuarially reduced in accordance with section 8334(d)(2)(B) of title 5 .

(4) Entitlement under another system

Credit toward retirement under the system shall not be allowed for any period of civilian service on the basis of which the participant is receiving (or will in the future be entitled to receive) an annuity under another retirement system for Government employees, unless the right to such annuity is waived and a deposit is made under paragraph (1) covering that period of service, or a transfer is made pursuant to subsection (c).
