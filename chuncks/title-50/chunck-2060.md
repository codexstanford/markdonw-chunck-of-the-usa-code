### CHAPTER 45— MISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AUTHORITIES
#### § 3334l. Oversight of Defense Intelligence Agency culture
##### (b) Findings

Congress finds that the Defense Intelligence Agency has committed to improving Agency culture and leadership; however, actions taken by the Agency as of December 23, 2022 , have not enabled a full assessment of the extent of workforce culture issues and potential management abuses, and require additional Congressional  1 oversight to ensure concerns are both understood and addressed.
