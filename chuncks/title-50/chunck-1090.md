##### (c) Environmental Management University Program

(1) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a program, to be known as the “Environmental Management University Program”, to

(A) engage faculty, post-doctoral fellows or researchers, and graduate students of institutions of higher education on subjects relating to the mission to show a clear path for students for employment within the environmental management enterprise;

(B) provide institutions of higher education and the Department access to advances in engineering and science;

(C) clearly identify to institutions of higher education the tools necessary to enter into the environmental management field professionally; and

(D) encourage current employees of the Department to pursue advanced degrees.

(2) Areas of focus

The Secretary may include as areas of focus for a grant made under the Environmental Management University Program the following:

(A) The atomic- and molecular-scale chemistries of waste processing.

(B) Contaminant immobilization in engineered and natural systems.

(C) Developing innovative materials, with an emphasis on nanomaterials or biomaterials, that could enable sequestration of challenging hazardous or radioactive constituents such as technetium and iodine.

(D) Elucidating and exploiting complex speciation and reactivity far from equilibrium.

(E) Understanding and controlling chemical and physical processes at interfaces.

(F) Harnessing physical and chemical processes to revolutionize separations.

(G) Tailoring waste forms for contaminants in harsh chemical environments.

(H) Predicting and understanding subsurface system behavior and response to perturbations.

(3) Individual research grants

In carrying out the Environmental Management University Program, the Secretary may make individual research grants to faculty, post-doctoral fellows or researchers, and graduate students of institutions of higher education for three-year research projects, with an option for an extension of one additional two-year period.

(4) Grants for interdisciplinary collaborations

In carrying out the Environmental Management University Program, the Secretary may make research grants for strategic partnerships among scientists, faculty, post-doctoral fellows or researchers, and graduate students of institutions of higher education for three-year research projects.

(5) Hiring of undergraduates

In carrying out the Environmental Management University Program, the Secretary may establish a summer internship program for undergraduates of institutions of higher education to work on projects relating to environmental management.

(6) Workshops

In carrying out the Environmental Management University Program, the Secretary may hold workshops with the Office of Environmental Management, the Office of Science, and members of academia and industry concerning environmental management challenges and solutions.
