#### § 2569. Acceleration of removal or security of fissile materials, radiological materials, and related equipment at vulnerable sites worldwide
##### (g) Definitions

In this section:

(1) The term “fissile materials” means plutonium, highly-enriched uranium, or other material capable of sustaining an explosive nuclear chain reaction, including irradiated items containing such materials if the radiation field from such items is not sufficient to prevent the theft or misuse of such items.

(2) The term “radiological materials” includes Americium-241, Californium-252, Cesium-137, Cobalt-60, Iridium-192, Plutonium-238, Radium-226, Strontium-90, Curium-244, and irradiated items containing such materials, or other materials designated by the Secretary of Energy for purposes of this paragraph.

(3) The term “related equipment” includes equipment useful for enrichment of uranium in the isotope 235 and for extraction of fissile materials from irradiated fuel rods and other equipment designated by the Secretary of Energy for purposes of this section.

(4) The term “highly-enriched uranium” means uranium enriched to or above 20 percent in the isotope 235.

(5) The term “low-enriched uranium” means uranium enriched below 20 percent in the isotope 235.

(6) The term “proliferation-attractive”, in the case of fissile materials and radiological materials, means quantities and types of such materials that are determined by the Secretary of Energy to present a significant risk to the national security of the United States if diverted to a use relating to proliferation.

(7) The term “alternative technologies” means technologies, such as accelerator-based equipment, that do not use radiological materials.
