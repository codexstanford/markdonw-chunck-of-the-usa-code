### CHAPTER 55— DEFENSE PRODUCTION
#### § 4532. Loans to private business enterprises
##### (d) Aggregate loan amounts

(1) In general

If the making of any loan under this section to correct a shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all obligations of the Federal Government under this subchapter relating to such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, such loan may be made only

(A) if the President has notified the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, in writing, of the proposed loan; and

(B) after the 30-day period following the date on which notice under subparagraph (A) is provided.

(2) Waivers authorized

The requirements of paragraph (1) may be waived

(A) during a period of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; and

(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific loan is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.
