### CHAPTER 46— CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
#### § 3525. Office of the Ombudsman for Analytic Objectivity
##### (b) Duties and responsibilities

The Ombudsman shall

(1) on an annual basis, conduct a survey of analytic objectivity among officers and employees of the Agency;

(2) implement a procedure by which any officer or employee of the Agency may submit to the Office a complaint alleging politicization, bias, lack of objectivity, or other issues relating to a failure of tradecraft in analysis conducted by the Agency;

(3) except as provided in paragraph (4), upon receiving a complaint submitted pursuant to paragraph (2), take reasonable action to investigate the complaint, make a determination as to whether the incident described in the complaint involved politicization, bias, or lack of objectivity, and prepare a report that

(A) summarizes the facts relevant to the complaint;

(B) documents the determination of the Ombudsman with respect to the complaint; and

(C) contains a recommendation for remedial action;

(4) if a complaint submitted pursuant to paragraph (2) alleges politicization, bias, or lack of objectivity in the collection of intelligence information, refer the complaint to the official responsible for supervising collection operations of the Agency; and

(5) continuously monitor changes in areas of analysis that the Ombudsman determines involve a heightened risk of politicization, bias, or lack of objectivity, to ensure that any change in the analytic line arises from proper application of analytic tradecraft and not as a result of politicization, bias, or lack of objectivity.
