(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to a proportion of 50 percent of such lump-sum credit which is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.

(3) Share for former wife or husband

Payment of the former participant’s lump-sum credit shall be subject to the terms of a court order under section 2094(c) of this title concerning any former wife or husband of the former participant if

(A) the court order expressly relates to any portion of such lump-sum credit; and

A lump-sum credit may be paid to or for the benefit of a former participant
