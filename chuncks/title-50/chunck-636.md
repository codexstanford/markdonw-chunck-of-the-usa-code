(ii) the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final; or

(iii) such former spouse’s 50th birthday; and

(ii) the date on which the annuity of the participant terminates.

(2) Disability annuities

Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A)(i), in the case of a former spouse of a disability annuitant

(A) the annuity of the former spouse shall commence on the date on which the participant would qualify on the basis of the participant’s creditable service for an annuity under this subchapter (other than disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later; and

(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.

(3) Election of benefits

A former spouse of a participant or retired participant shall not become entitled under this section to an annuity or to the restoration of an annuity payable from the fund unless the former spouse elects to receive it instead of any survivor annuity to which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.

An annuity under this section shall not be payable unless appropriate written application is provided to the Director, complete with any supporting documentation which the Director may by regulation require, not later than June 2, 1990 . The Director may waive the application deadline under the preceding sentence in any case in which the Director determines that the circumstances warrant such a waiver.

(B) Retroactive benefits

Upon approval of an application under subparagraph (A), the appropriate annuity shall be payable to the former spouse with respect to all periods before such approval during which the former spouse was entitled to an annuity under this section, but in no event shall an annuity be payable under this section with respect to any period before December 2, 1987 .
