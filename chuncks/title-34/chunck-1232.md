#### § 12611. Motor vehicle theft prevention program
##### (d) Specified conditions under which stops may be authorized

(1) In general

The Attorney General shall promulgate rules establishing the conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be authorized to be stopped under this section. These conditions may not be based on race, creed, color, national origin, gender, or age. These conditions may include

(A) the operation of the vehicle during certain hours of the day; or

(B) the operation of the vehicle under other circumstances that would provide a sufficient basis for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not being operated by the owner, or with the consent of the owner.

(2) More than one set of conditions

The Attorney General may establish more than one set of conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be stopped. If more than one set of conditions is established, a separate consent form and a separate design for program decals or devices shall be established for each set of conditions. The Attorney General may choose to satisfy the requirement of a separate design for program decals or devices under this paragraph by the use of a design color that is clearly distinguishable from other design colors.

(3) No new conditions without consent

After the program has begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped if affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be expanded without the consent of the owner.

(4) Limited participation by States and localities

A State or locality need not authorize the stopping of motor vehicles under all sets of conditions specified under the program in order to participate in the program.
