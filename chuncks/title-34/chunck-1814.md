(2) Independent judgment

The standards referred to in paragraph (1) shall be based upon the independent judgment of the Attorney General, after giving due consideration to the recommended national standards provided by the Commission under section 30306(e) of this title , and being informed by such data, opinions, and proposals that the Attorney General determines to be appropriate to consider.
