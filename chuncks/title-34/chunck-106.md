##### (b) Criteria for selecting programs for review

In selecting programs for review, the Director of the National Institute of Justice should consider

(2) the cost of the program to be evaluated and the number of similar programs funded under section 10156 (formula grants) of this title;

(3) whether the program has a high potential to be replicated in other jurisdictions; and

(4) whether there is substantial public awareness and community involvement in the program. Routine auditing, monitoring, and internal assessment of a State and local drug control program’s progress shall be the sole responsibility of the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
