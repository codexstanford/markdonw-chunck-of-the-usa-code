#### § 30303. National prison rape statistics, data, and research
##### (c) Reports

(1) In general

Not later than June 30 of each year, the Attorney General shall submit a report on the activities of the Bureau and the Review Panel, with respect to prison rape, for the preceding calendar year to

(A) Congress; and

(B) the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

(2) Contents

The report required under paragraph (1) shall include

(A) with respect to the effects of prison rape, statistical, sociological, and psychological data;

(B) with respect to the incidence of prison rape

(i) statistical data aggregated at the Federal, State, prison system, and prison levels;

(ii) a listing of those institutions in the representative sample, separated into each category identified under subsection (c)(4) and ranked according to the incidence of prison rape in each institution; and

(iii) an identification of those institutions in the representative sample that appear to have been successful in deterring prison rape; and

(C) a listing of any prisons in the representative sample that did not cooperate with the survey conducted pursuant to this section.

(3) Data adjustments

In preparing the information specified in paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall use established statistical methods to adjust the data as necessary to account for differences among institutions in the representative sample, which are not related to the detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of prison rape, or which are outside the control of the State, prison, or prison system, in order to provide an accurate comparison among prisons. Such differences may include the mission, security level, size, and jurisdiction under which the prison operates. For each such adjustment made, the Attorney General shall identify and explain such adjustment in the report.

(4) Categorization of prisons

The report shall divide the prisons surveyed into three categories. One category shall be composed of all Federal and State prisons. The other two categories shall be defined by the Attorney General in order to compare similar institutions.
