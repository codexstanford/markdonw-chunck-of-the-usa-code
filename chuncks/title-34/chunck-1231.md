#### § 12611. Motor vehicle theft prevention program
##### (c) Voluntary consent form

The voluntary consent form used to enroll in the program shall

(1) clearly state that participation in the program is voluntary;

(2) clearly explain that participation in the program means that, if the participating vehicle is being operated under the specified conditions, law enforcement officials may stop the vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether it is being operated by or with the consent of the owner, even if the law enforcement officials have no other basis for believing that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully;

(3) include an express statement that the vehicle is not normally operated under the specified conditions and that the operation of the vehicle under those conditions would provide sufficient grounds for a prudent law enforcement officer to reasonably believe that the vehicle was not being operated by or with the consent of the owner; and

(4) include any additional information that the Attorney General may reasonably require.
