##### (a) Grant authority of Director; chief executive of States; amount; insufficient funds

(1) Subject to the availability of money in the Fund, the Director shall make an annual grant from any portion of the Fund made available by section 20101(d)(2)  1 of this title for the purpose of grants under this subsection, or for the purpose of grants under section 20102 of this title but not used for that purpose, to the chief executive of each State for the financial support of eligible crime victim assistance programs.

(2) Such chief executive shall

(A) certify that priority shall be given to eligible crime victim assistance programs providing assistance to victims of sexual assault, spousal abuse, or child abuse;

(B) certify that funds shall be made available for grants to programs which serve previously underserved populations of victims of violent crime.

(C) certify that funds awarded to eligible crime victim assistance programs will not be used to supplant State and local funds otherwise available for crime victim assistance; and

(D) provide such other information and assurances related to the purposes of this section as the Director may reasonably require.

(3) The amounts of grants under paragraph (1) shall be

(A) the base amount to each State; and

(B) that portion of the then remaining available money to each State that results from a distribution among the States on the basis of each State’s population in relation to the population of all States.

(4) If the amount available for grants under paragraph (1) is insufficient to provide the base amount to each State, the funds available shall be distributed equally among the States.

(5) As used in this subsection, the term “base amount” means

(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), $500,000; and

(B) for the territories of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Republic of Palau, $200,000, with the Republic of Palau’s share governed by the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republic of Palau.

(6) An agency of the Federal Government performing local law enforcement functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States may qualify as an eligible crime victim assistance program for the purpose of grants under this subsection, or for the purpose of grants under subsection (c)(1).

(7)

(A) Each chief executive may waive a matching requirement imposed by the Director, in accordance with subparagraph (B), as a condition for the receipt of funds under any program to provide assistance to victims of crimes authorized under this subchapter. The chief executive shall report to the Director the approval of any waiver of the matching requirement.
