(A) a list of the resources necessary to establish an Ashanti Alert plan;

(B) criteria for evaluating whether a situation warrants issuing an Ashanti Alert, taking into consideration the need for the use of Ashanti Alerts to be limited in scope because the effectiveness of the Ashanti Alert communications network may be affected by overuse, including criteria to determine

(i) whether the mental capacity of an adult who is missing, and the circumstances of his or her disappearance, including any history of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, or human trafficking, warrant the issuance of an Ashanti Alert; and

(ii) whether the individual who reports that an adult is missing is an appropriate and credible source on which to base the issuance of an Ashanti Alert;

(C) a description of the appropriate uses of the Ashanti Alert name to readily identify the nature of search efforts for missing adults; and

(D) recommendations on how to protect the privacy, dignity, independence, autonomy, and safety of any missing adult who may be the subject of an Ashanti Alert;

(3) develop proposed protocols for efforts to recover missing adults and to reduce the number of adults who are reported missing, including protocols for procedures that are needed from the time of initial notification of a law enforcement agency that the adult is missing through the time of the return of the adult to family, guardian, or domicile, as appropriate, including

(A) public safety communications protocol;

(B) case management protocol;

(C) command center operations;

(D) reunification protocol;

(E) incident review, evaluation, debriefing, and public information procedures; and

(F) protocols for declining to issue an Ashanti Alert;

(4) work with States and Indian Tribes to ensure appropriate regional coordination of various elements of the network;

(5) establish an advisory group to assist States, Indian Tribes, units of local government, law enforcement agencies, and other entities involved in the Ashanti Alert communications network with initiating, facilitating, and promoting Ashanti Alert plans, which shall include

(A) to the maximum extent practicable, representation from the various geographic regions of the United States; and

(B) members who are

(i) representatives of adult citizen advocacy groups, law enforcement agencies, victim service providers (as defined in section 12291(a) of this title ), and public safety communications;

(ii) broadcasters, first responders, dispatchers, and radio station personnel; and

(iii) representatives of any other individuals or organizations that the Coordinator determines are necessary to the success of the Ashanti Alert communications network; and

(6) act as the nationwide point of contact for
