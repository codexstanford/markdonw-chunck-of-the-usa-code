#### § 60551. Offender reentry research
##### (b) Bureau of Justice Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics may conduct research on offender reentry, including

(1) an analysis of special populations (including prisoners with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, female offenders, juvenile offenders, offenders with limited English proficiency, and the elderly) that present unique reentry challenges;

(2) studies to determine which offenders are returning to prison, jail, or a juvenile facility and which of those returning offenders represent the greatest risk to victims and community safety;

(3) annual reports on the demographic characteristics of the population reentering society from prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities;

(4) a national recidivism study every 3 years;

(5) a study of parole, probation, or post-incarceration supervision violations and revocations; and

(6) a study concerning the most appropriate measure to be used when reporting recidivism rates (whether rearrest, reincarceration, or any other valid, evidence-based measure).
