##### (c) Documentation

(1) Request for documentation

If an applicant for, or tenant of, housing assisted under a covered housing program represents to a public housing agency or owner or manager of the housing that the individual is entitled to protection under subsection (b), the public housing agency or owner or manager may request, in writing, that the applicant or tenant submit to the public housing agency or owner or manager a form of documentation described in paragraph (3).

(2) Failure to provide certification

(A) In general

If an applicant or tenant does not provide the documentation requested under paragraph (1) within 14 business days after the tenant receives a request in writing for such certification from a public housing agency or owner or manager of housing assisted under a covered housing program, nothing in this subpart may be construed to limit the authority of the public housing agency or owner or manager to

(i) deny admission by the applicant or tenant to the covered program;

(ii) deny assistance under the covered program to the applicant or tenant;

(iii) terminate the participation of the applicant or tenant in the covered program; or

(iv) evict the applicant, the tenant, or a lawful occupant that commits violations of a lease.

(B) Extension

A public housing agency or owner or manager of housing may extend the 14-day deadline under subparagraph (A) at its discretion.

(3) Form of documentation

A form of documentation described in this paragraph is

(A) a certification form approved by the appropriate agency that

(i) states that an applicant or tenant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking;

(ii) states that the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for protection under subsection (b) meets the requirements under subsection (b); and

(iii) includes the name of the individual who committed the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the name is known and safe to provide;

(B) a document that

(i) is signed by

(I) an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider, an attorney, a medical professional, or a mental health professional from whom an applicant or tenant has sought assistance relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of the abuse; and

(II) the applicant or tenant; and

(C) a record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial, or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency; or

(D) at the discretion of a public housing agency or owner or manager of housing assisted under a covered housing program, a statement or other evidence provided by an applicant or tenant.

(4) Confidentiality

Any information submitted to a public housing agency or owner or manager under this subsection, including the fact that an individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking shall be maintained in confidence by the public housing agency or owner or manager and may not be entered into any shared database or disclosed to any other entity or individual, except to the extent that the disclosure is

(A) requested or consented to by the individual in writing;

(B) required for use in an eviction proceeding under subsection (b); or

(C) otherwise required by applicable law.

(5) Documentation not required

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a public housing agency or owner or manager of housing assisted under a covered housing program to request that an individual submit documentation of the status of the individual as a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

(6) Compliance not sufficient to constitute evidence of unreasonable act

Compliance with subsection (b) by a public housing agency or owner or manager of housing assisted under a covered housing program based on documentation received under this subsection, shall not be sufficient to constitute evidence of an unreasonable act or omission by the public housing agency or owner or manager or an employee or agent of the public housing agency or owner or manager. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the liability of a public housing agency or owner or manager of housing assisted under a covered housing program for failure to comply with subsection (b).

(7) Response to conflicting certification

If a public housing agency or owner or manager of housing assisted under a covered housing program receives documentation under this subsection that contains conflicting information, the public housing agency or owner or manager may require an applicant or tenant to submit third-party documentation, as described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (3).

(8) Preemption

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to supersede any provision of any Federal, State, or local law that provides greater protection than this subsection for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
