(iii) the risk to the safety of any victim of the harm based on an evidence-based risk assessment;

(iv) the risk to public safety, including an evidence-based risk assessment of the danger to the public; and

(v) past participation of any individual who committed the harm in restorative practice programing; and

(B) denies eligibility to participate in the program for any individual who committed a harm against whom there is

(i) a pending felony or misdemeanor prosecution for an offense against any victim of the harm or a dependent of any such victim;

(ii) a restraining order or a protection order (as defined in section 2266 of title 18 ) that protects any victim of the harm or a dependent of any such victim, unless there is an exception in the restraining order or protective order allowing for participation in a restorative practices program;

(iii) a pending criminal charge involving or relating to sexual assault, including rape, human trafficking, or child abuse, including child sexual abuse; or

(iv) a conviction for child sexual abuse against the victim or a sibling of the victim if the victim or sibling of the victim is currently a minor.

With respect to a risk assessment described in paragraph (1)(A)(iii) for which an eligible entity or a subgrantee of an eligible entity determines that a victim or a dependent of a victim are at significant risk of subsequent serious injury, sexual assault, or death, the eligible entity or subgrantee shall refer the victim or dependent to other victim services, instead of restorative practices.
