#### § 10563. Allocation
##### (a) In general

(1) Population allocation

Eighty-five percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 10562 of this title so that each State shall receive an amount that bears the same ratio to the 85 percent of the total amount made available to carry out this subchapter for that fiscal year as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.

(2) Discretionary allocation

Fifteen percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year shall be allocated pursuant to the Attorney General’s discretion for competitive awards to States and units of local government. In making awards under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall consider the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by each State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 most recent calendar years for which data is available and consider the existing resources and current needs of the potential grant recipient.

(3) Minimum requirement

Each State shall receive not less than 1 percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year.

(4) Proportional reduction

If the amounts available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year are insufficient to pay in full the total payment that any State is otherwise eligible to receive under paragraph (3), then the Attorney General shall reduce payments under paragraph (1) for such payment period to the extent of such insufficiency. Reductions under the preceding sentence shall be allocated among the States (other than States whose payment is determined under paragraph (3)) in the same proportions as amounts would be allocated under paragraph (1) without regard to paragraph (3).
