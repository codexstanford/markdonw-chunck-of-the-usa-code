(B) Audit

Beginning in the first fiscal year beginning after July 22, 2016 , and in each fiscal year thereafter, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice shall conduct audits of recipients of grants awarded by the Attorney General under this subchapter to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of funds by grantees.

(E) Reimbursement

If an entity is awarded grant funds under this subchapter during the 2-fiscal-year period during which the entity is barred from receiving grants under subparagraph (C), the Attorney General shall
