#### § 11322. Accountability and oversight
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure that at-risk youth, and youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system or the criminal justice system, are treated fairly and that the outcome of that contact is beneficial to the Nation

(1) the Department of Justice, through its Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, must restore meaningful enforcement of the core requirements in subchapter II; and

(2) States, which are entrusted with a fiscal stewardship role if they accept funds under subchapter II  1 must exercise vigilant oversight to ensure full compliance with the core requirements for juveniles provided for in subchapter II.
