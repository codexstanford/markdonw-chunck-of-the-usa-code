##### (e) Principal and additional campaign committees; designations, status of candidate, authorized committees, etc.
######## (A) No political committee which supports or has supported more than one candidate may be designated as an authorized committee, except that

(i) the candidate for the office of President nominated by a political party may designate the national committee of such political party as a principal campaign committee, but only if that national committee maintains separate books of account with respect to its function as a principal campaign committee; and

(ii) candidates may designate a political committee established solely for the purpose of joint fundraising by such candidates as an authorized committee.

(B) As used in this section, the term “support” does not include a contribution by any authorized committee in amounts of $2,000 or less to an authorized committee of any other candidate.

(4) The name of each authorized committee shall include the name of the candidate who authorized such committee under paragraph (1). In the case of any political committee which is not an authorized committee, such political committee shall not include the name of any candidate in its name.

(5) The name of any separate segregated fund established pursuant to section 30118(b) of this title shall include the name of its connected organization.
