The Governor of the State in which a local board is located may, pursuant to a request from the local board, grant a written waiver of the prohibition set forth in subparagraph (A) (relating to the provision of training services) for a program of training services, if the local board

(i) submits to the Governor a proposed request for the waiver that includes

(I) satisfactory evidence that there is an insufficient number of eligible providers of such a program of training services to meet local demand in the local area;

(II) information demonstrating that the board meets the requirements for an eligible provider of training services under section 3152 of this title ; and

The Governor shall have the authority to revoke the waiver during the appropriate period described in subparagraph (C) if the Governor determines the waiver is no longer needed or that the local board involved has engaged in a pattern of inappropriate referrals to training services operated by the local board.

A local board may provide career services described in section 3174(c)(2) of this title through a one-stop delivery system or be designated or certified as a one-stop operator only with the agreement of the chief elected official in the local area and the Governor.
