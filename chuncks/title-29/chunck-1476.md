(A) the monthly benefit of the participant or beneficiary which is described in subsection (a) and which is eligible for the corporation’s guarantee under subsection (b), except that such benefit shall be

(i) no greater than the monthly benefit which would be payable under the plan at normal retirement age in the form of a single life annuity, and

(ii) determined without regard to any reduction under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26 ; divided by

(B) the participant’s years of credited service.

(3) For purposes of this subsection

(A) a year of credited service is a year in which the participant completed

(i) a full year of participation in the plan, or

(ii) any period of service before participation which is credited for purposes of benefit accrual as the equivalent of a full year of participation;

(B) any year for which the participant is credited for purposes of benefit accrual with a fraction of the equivalent of a full year of participation shall be counted as such a fraction of a year of credited service; and
