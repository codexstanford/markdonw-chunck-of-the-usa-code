#### § 3195. Recruitment, screening, selection, and assignment of enrollees
##### (b) Special limitations on selection

(1) In general

No individual shall be selected as an enrollee unless the individual or organization implementing the standards and procedures described in subsection (a) determines that

(A) there is a reasonable expectation that the individual considered for selection can participate successfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to engage in behavior that would prevent other enrollees from receiving the benefit of the Job Corps program or be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline and satisfactory relationships between the Job Corps center to which the individual might be assigned and communities surrounding the Job Corps center;

(B) the individual manifests a basic understanding of both the rules to which the individual will be subject and of the consequences of failure to observe the rules, and agrees to comply with such rules; and

(C) the individual has passed a background check conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary and with applicable State and local laws.

(2) Individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release

An individual on probation, parole, or supervised release may be selected as an enrollee only if release from the supervision of the probation or parole official involved is satisfactory to the official and the Secretary and does not violate applicable laws (including regulations). No individual shall be denied a position in the Job Corps solely on the basis of individual contact with the criminal justice system except for a disqualifying conviction as specified in paragraph (3).

(3) Individuals convicted of certain crimes

An individual shall not be selected as an enrollee if the individual has been convicted of a felony consisting of murder (as described in section 1111 of title 18 ), child abuse, or a crime involving rape or sexual assault.
