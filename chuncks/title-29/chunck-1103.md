#### § 1084. Minimum funding standards for multiemployer plans
##### (d) Extension of amortization periods for multiemployer plans

(1) Automatic extension upon application by certain plans

(A) In general

If the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan

(i) submits to the Secretary of the Treasury an application for an extension of the period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) or described in subsection (b)(4), and

(ii) includes with the application a certification by the plan’s actuary described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary of the Treasury shall extend the amortization period for the period of time (not in excess of 5 years) specified in the application. Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (2).

(B) Criteria

A certification with respect to a multiemployer plan is described in this subparagraph if the plan’s actuary certifies that, based on reasonable assumptions

(i) absent the extension under subparagraph (A), the plan would have an accumulated funding deficiency in the current plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years,

(ii) the plan sponsor has adopted a plan to improve the plan’s funding status,

(iii) the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period as extended, and

(iv) the notice required under paragraph (3)(A) has been provided.

(2) Alternative extension

(A) In general

If the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan submits to the Secretary of the Treasury an application for an extension of the period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) or described in subsection (b)(4), the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the amortization period for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years reduced by the number of years of any extension under paragraph (1) with respect to such unfunded liability) if the Secretary of the Treasury makes the determination described in subparagraph (B). Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (1).

(B) Determination

The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an extension under subparagraph (A) if such Secretary determines that

(i) such extension would carry out the purposes of this chapter and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and

(ii) the failure to permit such extension would

(I) result in a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and

(II) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate.

(C) Action by Secretary of the Treasury

The Secretary of the Treasury shall act upon any application for an extension under this paragraph within 180 days of the submission of such application. If such Secretary rejects the application for an extension under this paragraph, such Secretary shall provide notice to the plan detailing the specific reasons for the rejection, including references to the criteria set forth above.

(3) Advance notice

(A) In general

The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting an extension under this subsection, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such extension to each affected party (as defined in section 1301(a)(21) of this title ) with respect to the affected plan. Such notice shall include a description of the extent to which the plan is funded for benefits which are guaranteed under subchapter III and for benefit liabilities.

(B) Consideration of relevant information

The Secretary of the Treasury shall consider any relevant information provided by a person to whom notice was given under paragraph (1).
