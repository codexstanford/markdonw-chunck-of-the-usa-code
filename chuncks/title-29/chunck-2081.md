##### (h) Funding of one-stop infrastructure

(1) In general

(A) Options for infrastructure funding

(i) Local options

The local board, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners described in subsection (b)(1) in a local area may fund the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in the local area through

(I) methods agreed on by the local board, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners (and described in the memorandum of understanding described in subsection (c)); or

(II) if no consensus agreement on methods is reached under subclause (I), the State infrastructure funding mechanism described in paragraph (2).

(ii) Failure to reach consensus agreement on funding methods

Beginning July 1, 2016 , if the local board, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners described in subsection (b)(1) in a local area fail to reach consensus agreement on methods of sufficiently funding the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers for a program year, the State infrastructure funding mechanism described in paragraph (2) shall be applicable to such local area for that program year and for each subsequent program year for which those entities and individuals fail to reach such agreement.

(B) Guidance for infrastructure funding

In addition to carrying out the requirements relating to the State infrastructure funding mechanism described in paragraph (2), the Governor, after consultation with chief elected officials, local boards, and the State board, and consistent with the guidance and policies provided by the State board under subparagraphs (B) and (C)(i) of section 3111(d)(7) of this title , shall provide, for the use of local areas under subparagraph (A)(i)(I)

(i) guidelines for State-administered one-stop partner programs, for determining such programs’ contributions to a one-stop delivery system, based on such programs’ proportionate use of such system consistent with chapter II of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling), including determining funding for the costs of infrastructure, which contributions shall be negotiated pursuant to the memorandum of understanding under subsection (c); and

(ii) guidance to assist local boards, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners in local areas in determining equitable and stable methods of funding the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in such areas.

(2) State one-stop infrastructure funding

(A) Definition

In this paragraph, the term “covered portion”, used with respect to funding for a fiscal year for a program described in subsection (b)(1), means a portion determined under subparagraph (C) of the Federal funds provided to a State (including local areas within the State) under the Federal law authorizing that program described in subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year (taking into account the availability of funding for purposes related to infrastructure from philanthropic organizations, private entities, or other alternative financing options).

(B) Partner contributions

Subject to subparagraph (D), for local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), the covered portions of funding for a fiscal year shall be provided to the Governor from the programs described in subsection (b)(1), to assist in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in those local areas of the State not adequately funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).

(C) Determination of Governor

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii) and subparagraph (D), the Governor, after consultation with chief elected officials, local boards, and the State board, shall determine the portion of funds to be provided under subparagraph (B) by each one-stop partner from each program described in subparagraph (B). In making such determination for the purpose of determining funding contributions, for funding pursuant to clause (i)(II) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) by each partner, the Governor shall calculate amounts for the proportionate use of the one-stop centers in the State, consistent with chapter II of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling), taking into account the costs of administration of the one-stop delivery system for purposes not related to one-stop centers, for each partner. The Governor shall exclude from such determination of funds the amounts for proportionate use of one-stop centers attributable to the programs of one-stop partners for those local areas of the State where the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers are funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The Governor shall also take into account the statutory requirements for each partner program and the partner program’s ability to fulfill such requirements.

(ii) Special rule

In a State in which the State constitution or a State statute places policymaking authority that is independent of the authority of the Governor in an entity or official with respect to the funds provided for adult education and literacy activities authorized under subchapter II, postsecondary career and technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 ( 20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), or vocational rehabilitation services offered under a provision covered by section 3102(13)(D) of this title , the determination described in clause (i) with respect to the programs authorized under that subchapter, Act, or provision shall be made by the chief officer of the entity, or the official, with such authority in consultation with the Governor.

(D) Limitations

(i) Provision from administrative funds

(I) In general

Subject to subclause (II), the funds provided under this paragraph by each one-stop partner shall be provided only from funds available for the costs of administration under the program administered by such partner, and shall be subject to the program’s limitations with respect to the portion of funds under such program that may be used for administration.

(II) Exceptions

Nothing in this clause shall be construed to apply to the programs carried out under this subchapter, or under title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 ( 42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.).

(ii) Cap on required contributions

For local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), the following rules shall apply:

(I) WIA formula programs and employment service

The portion of funds required to be contributed under this paragraph from a program authorized under subpart 2 or 3, or the Wagner-Peyser Act ( 29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.) shall not exceed 3 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year.

(II) Other one-stop partners

The portion of funds required to be contributed under this paragraph from a program described in subsection (b)(1) other than the programs described in subclause (I) shall not exceed 1.5 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year.

(III) Vocational rehabilitation

Notwithstanding subclauses (I) and (II), an entity administering a program described in subsection (b)(1)(B)(iv) shall not be required to provide from that program, under this paragraph, a portion that exceeds

(aa) 0.75 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out such program in the State for the second full program year that begins after July 22, 2014 ;

(bb) 1.0 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for the third full program year that begins after such date;

(cc) 1.25 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for the fourth full program year that begins after such date; and

(dd) 1.5 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for the fifth and each succeeding full program year that begins after such date.

(iii) Federal direct spending programs

For local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), an entity administering a program funded with direct spending as defined in section 900(c)(8) of title 2 , as in effect on February 15, 2014 3 shall not be required to provide, for purposes of this paragraph, an amount in excess of the amount determined under subparagraph (C)(i) to be equivalent to the cost of the proportionate use of the one-stop centers for the one-stop partner for such program in the State.

(iv) Native American programs

One-stop partners for Native American programs established under section 3221 of this title shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection (other than this clause) or subsection (i). For purposes of subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii)(II), the method for determining the appropriate portion of funds to be provided by such partners to pay for the costs of infrastructure of a one-stop center shall be determined as part of the development of the memorandum of understanding under subsection (c) for the one-stop center and shall be stated in the memorandum.

(E) Appeal by one-stop partners

The Governor shall establish a process, described under section 3112(b)(2)(D)(i)(IV) of this title , for a one-stop partner administering a program described in subsection (b)(1) to appeal a determination regarding the portion of funds to be provided under this paragraph. Such a determination may be appealed under the process on the basis that such determination is inconsistent with the requirements of this paragraph. Such process shall ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of section 3242(e) of this title .

(3) Allocation by Governor

(A) In general

From the funds provided under paragraph (1), the Governor shall allocate the funds to local areas described in subparagraph (B) in accordance with the formula established under subparagraph (B) for the purposes of assisting in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers.

(B) Allocation formula

The State board shall develop a formula to be used by the Governor to allocate the funds provided under paragraph (1) to local areas not funding costs of infrastructure under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The formula shall be based on factors including the number of one-stop centers in a local area, the population served by such centers, the services provided by such centers, and other factors relating to the performance of such centers that the State board determines are appropriate.

(4) Costs of infrastructure

In this subsection, the term “costs of infrastructure”, used with respect to a one-stop center, means the nonpersonnel costs that are necessary for the general operation of the one-stop center, including the rental costs of the facilities, the costs of utilities and maintenance, equipment (including assessment-related products and assistive technology for individuals with disabilities), and technology to facilitate access to the one-stop center, including the center’s planning and outreach activities.
