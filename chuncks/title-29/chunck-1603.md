##### (b) Factors determining computation of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
######## (E) An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of a change in unfunded vested benefits is the product of

(i) the unamortized amount of such change (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by

(ii) a fraction

(I) the numerator of which is the sum of the contributions required to be made under the plan by the employer for the year in which such change arose and for the 4 preceding plan years, and

(II) the denominator of which is the sum for the plan year in which such change arose and the 4 preceding plan years of all contributions made by employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the plan year in which such change arose reduced by the contributions made in such years by employers who had withdrawn from the plan in the year in which the change arose.

(3) An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980 , is the product of

(A) such unamortized amount; multiplied by

(B) a fraction

(i) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the most recent 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980 , and

(ii) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the most recent 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980 , by all employers

(I) who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending on or after such date, and

(II) who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.

(4)

(A) An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending before the plan year in which the employer withdrew from the plan.
