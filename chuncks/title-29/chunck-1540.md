#### § 1362. Liability for termination of single-employer plans under a distress termination or a termination by corporation
##### (d) Definitions

(1) Collective net worth of persons subject to liability

(A) In general

The collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination consists of the sum of the individual net worths of all persons who

(i) have individual net worths which are greater than zero, and

(ii) are (as of the termination date) contributing sponsors of the terminated plan or members of their controlled groups.

(B) Determination of net worth

For purposes of this paragraph, the net worth of a person is

(i) determined on whatever basis best reflects, in the determination of the corporation, the current status of the person’s operations and prospects at the time chosen for determining the net worth of the person, and

(ii) increased by the amount of any transfers of assets made by the person which are determined by the corporation to be improper under the circumstances, including any such transfers which would be inappropriate under title 11 if the person were a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of such title.

(C) Timing of determination

For purposes of this paragraph, determinations of net worth shall be made as of a day chosen by the corporation (during the 120-day period ending with the termination date) and shall be computed without regard to any liability under this section.

(2) Pre-tax profits

The term “pre-tax profits” means

(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), for any fiscal year of any person, such person’s consolidated net income (excluding any extraordinary charges to income and including any extraordinary credits to income) for such fiscal year, as shown on audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or

(B) for any fiscal year of an organization described in section 501(c) of title 26 , the excess of income over expenses (as such terms are defined for such organizations under generally accepted accounting principles), before provision for or deduction of Federal or other income tax, any contribution to any single-employer plan of which such person is a contributing sponsor at any time during the period beginning on the termination date and ending with the end of such fiscal year, and any amounts required to be paid for such fiscal year under this section. The corporation may by regulation require such information to be filed on such forms as may be necessary to determine the existence and amount of such pre-tax profits.
