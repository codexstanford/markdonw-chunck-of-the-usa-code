## Subtitle E— Special Provisions for Multiemployer Plans
#### § 1413. Partitions of eligible multiemployer plans
##### (d) Plans created by partition orders

(1) The plan created by the partition order is a successor plan to which section 1322a of this title applies.

(2) The plan sponsor of an eligible multiemployer plan prior to the partition and the administrator of such plan shall be the plan sponsor and the administrator, respectively, of the plan created by the partition order.

(3) In the event an employer withdraws from the plan that was partitioned within ten years following the date of the partition order, withdrawal liability shall be computed under section 1381 of this title with respect to both the plan that was partitioned and the plan created by the partition order. If the withdrawal occurs more than ten years after the date of the partition order, withdrawal liability shall be computed under section 1381 of this title only with respect to the plan that was partitioned (and not with respect to the plan created by the partition order).
