(C) by both, which has, in practice, met the requirements of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 (as in effect for the preceding 5 plan years of the plan) applicable to the plans described in paragraph (2) for the preceding 5 plan years; or

(2) is, or has been determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be, a plan described in section 401(a) of title 26 , or which meets, or has been determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to meet, the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26 .
