(i) Determination

The director of a designated State unit, as provided in paragraph (2), or the Administrator, as provided in paragraph (3), shall award grants under this section for an initial fiscal year if the Administrator determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State for a preceding fiscal year to support the general operation of centers for independent living meeting the requirements of this subpart equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.

(ii) Grants

The director of a designated State unit or the Administrator, as appropriate, shall award such grants, from the amount of funds so allotted for the initial fiscal year, to eligible agencies in the State for the planning, conduct, administration, and evaluation of centers for independent living that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f–4 of this title .

(iii) Regulation

The Administrator shall by regulation specify the preceding fiscal year with respect to which the Administrator will make the determinations described in clause (i) and subparagraph (B), making such adjustments as may be necessary to accommodate State funding cycles such as 2-year funding cycles or State fiscal years that do not coincide with the Federal fiscal year.

If the Administrator makes a determination described in subparagraph (A)(i) or (B), as appropriate, of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall approve the application and designate the director of the designated State unit to award the grant and carry out this section.

(3) Grants by Administrator

If the designated State agency of a State described in paragraph (1) does not submit and obtain approval of an application under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall award the grant described in paragraph (1) to eligible agencies in the State in accordance with section 796f–1 of this title .
