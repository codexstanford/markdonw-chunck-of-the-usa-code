##### (d) Extension of amortization periods

The period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability (described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B)) of any plan may be extended by the Secretary of the Treasury for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years) if such Secretary determines that such extension would carry out the purposes of this chapter and provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and if such Secretary determines that the failure to permit such extension would result in

(1) a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or

(2) a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation.
