(A) provide the career services described in section 3174(c)(2) of this title ;

(E) provide access to the data, information, and analysis described in section 15(a) of the Wagner-Peyser Act ( 29 U.S.C. 49 l –2(a)) and all job search, placement, recruitment, and other labor exchange services authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act ( 29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.).

(2) One-stop delivery

The one-stop delivery system

(A) at a minimum, shall make each of the programs, services, and activities described in paragraph (1) accessible at not less than 1 physical center in each local area of the State; and

(B) may also make programs, services, and activities described in paragraph (1) available

(i) through a network of affiliated sites that can provide 1 or more of the programs, services, and activities to individuals; and

(ii) through a network of eligible one-stop partners

(I) in which each partner provides 1 or more of the programs, services, and activities to such individuals and is accessible at an affiliated site that consists of a physical location or an electronically or technologically linked access point; and

(II) that assures individuals that information on the availability of the career services will be available regardless of where the individuals initially enter the statewide workforce development system, including information made available through an access point described in subclause (I);

(C) may have specialized centers to address special needs, such as the needs of dislocated workers, youth, or key industry sectors or clusters; and

(D) as applicable and practicable, shall make programs, services, and activities accessible to individuals through electronic means in a manner that improves efficiency, coordination, and quality in the delivery of one-stop partner services.

(3) Colocation of Wagner-Peyser services

Consistent with section 3(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act ( 29 U.S.C. 49b(d) ), and in order to improve service delivery, avoid duplication of services, and enhance coordination of services, including location of staff to ensure access to services in underserved areas, the employment service offices in each State shall be colocated with one-stop centers established under this subchapter.

(4) Use of common one-stop delivery system identifier

In addition to using any State or locally developed identifier, each one-stop delivery system shall include in the identification of products, programs, activities, services, facilities, and related property and materials, a common one-stop delivery system identifier. The identifier shall be developed by the Secretary, in consultation with heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, and representatives of State boards and local boards and of other stakeholders in the one-stop delivery system, not later than the beginning of the second full program year after July 22, 2014 . Such common identifier may consist of a logo, phrase, or other identifier that informs users of the one-stop delivery system that such products, programs, activities, services, facilities, property, or materials are being provided through such system. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit one-stop partners, States, or local areas from having additional identifiers.
