(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall not renew the terms of an agreement for any 1-year additional period described in subsection (f) for an entity to operate a particular Job Corps center if, for both of the 2 most recent preceding program years for which information is available at the time the determination is made, or if a second program year is not available, the preceding year for which information is available, such center

(A) has been ranked in the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers; and

(B) failed to achieve an average of 50 percent or higher of the expected level of performance under section 3209(c)(1) of this title with respect to each of the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth described in section 3141(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title .

(2) Exception

Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may exercise an option to renew the agreement for no more than 2 additional years if the Secretary determines such renewal would be in the best interest of the Job Corps program, taking into account factors including

(3) Detailed explanation

If the Secretary exercises an option under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall provide, to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, a detailed explanation of the rationale for exercising such option.

(4) Additional considerations

The Secretary shall only renew the agreement of an entity to operate a Job Corps center if the entity

(A) has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;

(B) has adequate financial resources to perform the agreement;

(C) has the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills; and

(D) is otherwise qualified and eligible under applicable laws and regulations, including that the contractor is not under suspension or debarred from eligibility for Federal contracts.
