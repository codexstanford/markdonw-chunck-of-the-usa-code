#### § 3113. Combined State plan
##### (c) Approval by the appropriate Secretaries

(1) Jurisdiction

The appropriate Secretary shall have the authority to approve the corresponding portion of a combined plan as described in subsection (d). On the approval of the appropriate Secretary, that portion of the combined plan, covering a program or activity, shall be implemented by the State pursuant to that portion of the combined plan, and the Federal law authorizing the program or activity.

(2) Approval of core programs

No portion of the plan relating to a core program shall be implemented until the appropriate Secretary approves the corresponding portions of the plan for all core programs.

(3) Timing of approval

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a portion of the combined State plan covering the core programs or a program or activity described in subsection (a)(2) shall be considered to be approved by the appropriate Secretary at the end of the 90-day period beginning on the day the plan is submitted.

(B) Plan approved by 3 or more appropriate Secretaries

If an appropriate Secretary other than the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education has authority to approve a portion of a combined plan, that portion of the combined plan shall be considered to be approved by the appropriate Secretary at the end of the 120-day period beginning on the day the plan is submitted.

(C) Disapproval

The portion shall not be considered to be approved if the appropriate Secretary makes a written determination, during the 90-day period (or the 120-day period, for an appropriate Secretary covered by subparagraph (B)), that the portion is not consistent with the requirements of the Federal law authorizing or applicable to the program or activity involved, including the criteria for approval of a plan or application, if any, under such law, or the plan is not consistent with the requirements of this section.

(4) Special rule

In paragraph (3), the term “criteria for approval of a plan or application”, with respect to a State and a core program or a program under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 ( 20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), includes a requirement for agreement between the State and the appropriate Secretaries regarding State performance measures or State performance accountability measures, as the case may be, including levels of performance.
