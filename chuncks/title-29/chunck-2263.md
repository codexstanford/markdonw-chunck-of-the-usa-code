#### § 3244. Fiscal controls; sanctions
##### (d) Repayment of amounts

(1) In general

Each recipient of funds under this subchapter shall be liable to repay the amounts described in subsection (c)(1), from funds other than funds received under this subchapter, upon a determination by the Secretary that the misexpenditure of the amounts was due to willful disregard of the requirements of this subchapter, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration, or a pattern of misexpenditure described in subsection (c)(1). No such determination shall be made under this subsection or subsection (c) until notice and opportunity for a fair hearing have been given to the recipient.

(2) Factors in imposing sanctions

In determining whether to impose any sanction authorized by this section against a recipient of funds under this subchapter for violations of this subchapter (including applicable regulations) by a subgrantee or contractor of such recipient, the Secretary shall first determine whether such recipient has adequately demonstrated that the recipient has

(A) established and adhered to an appropriate system, for entering into and monitoring subgrant agreements and contracts with subgrantees and contractors, that contains acceptable standards for ensuring accountability;

(B) entered into a written subgrant agreement or contract with such a subgrantee or contractor that established clear goals and obligations in unambiguous terms;

(C) acted with due diligence to monitor the implementation of the subgrant agreement or contract, including carrying out the appropriate monitoring activities (including audits) at reasonable intervals; and

(D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective action upon becoming aware of any evidence of a violation of this subchapter, including regulations issued under this subchapter, by such subgrantee or contractor.

(3) Waiver

If the Secretary determines that the recipient has demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive the imposition of sanctions authorized by this section upon such recipient. The Secretary is authorized to impose any sanction consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and with any applicable Federal or State law directly against any subgrantee or contractor for violation of this subchapter, including regulations issued under this subchapter.
