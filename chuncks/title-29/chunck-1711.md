# Title 29— LABOR
## Subtitle E— Special Provisions for Multiemployer Plans
#### § 1432. Special financial assistance by the corporation
##### (e) Actuarial assumptions

(1) Eligibility

For purposes of determining eligibility for special financial assistance, the corporation shall accept assumptions incorporated in a multiemployer plan’s determination that it is in critical status or critical and declining status (within the meaning of section 1085(b) of this title ) for certifications of plan status completed before January 1, 2021 , unless such assumptions are clearly erroneous. For certifications of plan status completed after December 31, 2020 , a plan shall determine whether it is in critical or critical and declining status for purposes of eligibility for special financial assistance by using the assumptions that the plan used in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021 , unless such assumptions (excluding the plan’s interest rate) are unreasonable.

(2) Amount of financial assistance

In determining the amount of special financial assistance in its application, an eligible multiemployer plan shall

(A) use the interest rate used by the plan in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021 , provided that such interest rate may not exceed the interest rate limit; and

(B) for other assumptions, use the assumptions that the plan used in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021 , unless such assumptions are unreasonable.

(3) Interest rate limit

The interest rate limit for purposes of this subsection is the rate specified in section 1083(h)(2)(C)(iii) of this title (disregarding modifications made under clause (iv) of such section) for the month in which the application for special financial assistance is filed by the eligible multiemployer plan or the 3 preceding months, with such specified rate increased by 200 basis points.

(4) Changes in assumptions

If a plan determines that use of one or more prior assumptions is unreasonable, the plan may propose in its application to change such assumptions, provided that the plan discloses such changes in its application and describes why such assumptions are no longer reasonable. The corporation shall accept such changed assumptions unless it determines the changes are unreasonable, individually or in the aggregate. The plan may not propose a change to the interest rate otherwise required under this subsection for eligibility or financial assistance amount.
