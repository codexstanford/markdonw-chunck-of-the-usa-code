## Subtitle A— General Provisions
#### § 1001a. Additional Congressional findings and declaration of policy
##### (b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program

The Congress further finds that

(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and

(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.
