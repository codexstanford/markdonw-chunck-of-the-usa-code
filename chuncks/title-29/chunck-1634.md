(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.

(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).

(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.

(V) For purposes of this clause, the term “required contributions” means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).

(iii) A plan may be amended to provide that for the first plan year ending on or after September 26, 1980 , the number “5” shall be substituted for the number “10” each place it appears in clause (i) or clause (ii) (whichever is appropriate). If the plan is so amended, the number “5” shall be increased by one for each succeeding plan year until the number “10” is reached.
