##### (i) Employment by retail or service establishment

No employer shall be deemed to have violated subsection (a) by employing any employee of a retail or service establishment for a workweek in excess of the applicable workweek specified therein, if (1) the regular rate of pay of such employee is in excess of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate applicable to him under section 206 of this title , and (2) more than half his compensation for a representative period (not less than one month) represents commissions on goods or services.
