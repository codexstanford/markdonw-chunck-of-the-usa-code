#### § 253. Compromise and waiver
##### (a) Compromise of certain existing claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Walsh-Healey Act, or the Bacon-Davis Act; limitations

Any cause of action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended [ 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], the Walsh-Healey Act, or the Bacon-Davis Act, 1 which accrued prior to May 14, 1947 , or any action (whether instituted prior to or on or after May 14, 1947 ) to enforce such a cause of action, may hereafter be compromised in whole or in part, if there exists a bona fide dispute as to the amount payable by the employer to his employee; except that no such action or cause of action may be so compromised to the extent that such compromise is based on an hourly wage rate less than the minimum required under such Act, or on a payment for overtime at a rate less than one and one-half times such minimum hourly wage rate.
