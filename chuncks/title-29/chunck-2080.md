(2) Criteria

The criteria and procedures developed under this subsection shall include standards relating to service coordination achieved by the one-stop delivery system with respect to the programs administered by the one-stop partners at the one-stop centers. Such criteria and procedures shall

(A) be developed in a manner that is consistent with the guidelines, guidance, and policies provided by the Governor and by the State board, in consultation with the chief elected officials and local boards, for such partners’ participation under subsections (h)(1) and (i); and

(B) include such factors relating to the effectiveness, accessibility, and improvement of the one-stop delivery system as the State board determines to be appropriate, including at a minimum how well the one-stop center

(ii) integrates available services; and

(iii) meets the workforce development and employment needs of local employers and participants.

(3) Local criteria

Consistent with the criteria developed under paragraph (1) by the State, a local board in the State may develop additional criteria (or higher levels of service coordination than required for the State-developed criteria) relating to service coordination achieved by the one-stop delivery system, for purposes of assessments described in paragraph (1), in order to respond to labor market, economic, and demographic, conditions and trends in the local area.

(4) Effect of certification

One-stop centers certified under this subsection shall be eligible to receive the infrastructure funding described in subsection (h).

(5) Review and update

The criteria and procedures established under this subsection shall be reviewed and updated by the State board or the local board, as the case may be, as part of the biennial process for review and modification of State and local plans described in sections 3112(c)(2) and 3123(a) of this title.
