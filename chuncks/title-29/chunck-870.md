(B) shall consider the ability of each such applicant to operate a center for independent living based on

(i) evidence of the need for such a center;

(iv) the quality of key personnel and the involvement of individuals with significant disabilities;

(v) budgets and cost-effectiveness;

(vi) an evaluation plan; and

(vii) the ability of such applicant to carry out the plans; and

(C) shall give priority to applications from applicants proposing to serve geographic areas within each State that are currently unserved or underserved by independent living programs, consistent with the provisions of the State plan submitted under section 796c of this title regarding establishment of a statewide network of centers for independent living.

(3) Current centers

Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a center for independent living that receives assistance under subpart 2 for a fiscal year shall be eligible for a grant for the subsequent fiscal year under this subsection.
