(A) Process

Except as provided in subsection (d), and consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3), in order for a State to receive an allotment under section 3162(b) or 3172(b) of this title, the Governor of the State shall designate local workforce development areas within the State

(i) through consultation with the State board; and

(ii) after consultation with chief elected officials and local boards, and after consideration of comments received through the public comment process as described in section 3112(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II) of this title .

(B) Considerations

The Governor shall designate local areas (except for those local areas described in paragraphs (2) and (3)) based on considerations consisting of the extent to which the areas

(i) are consistent with labor market areas in the State;

(ii) are consistent with regional economic development areas in the State; and

(iii) have available the Federal and non-Federal resources necessary to effectively administer activities under part B and other applicable provisions of this Act, including whether the areas have the appropriate education and training providers, such as institutions of higher education and area career and technical education schools.

(2) Initial designation

During the first 2 full program years following July 22, 2014 , the Governor shall approve a request for initial designation as a local area from any area that was designated as a local area for purposes of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for the 2-year period preceding July 22, 2014 , performed successfully, and sustained fiscal integrity.

(3) Subsequent designation

After the period for which a local area is initially designated under paragraph (2), the Governor shall approve a request for subsequent designation as a local area from such local area, if such area

(A) performed successfully;

(B) sustained fiscal integrity; and

(C) in the case of a local area in a planning region, met the requirements described in subsection (c)(1).

(4) Designation on recommendation of State board

The Governor may approve a request from any unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) for designation of an area as a local area if the State board determines, based on the considerations described in paragraph (1)(B), and recommends to the Governor, that such area should be so designated.

(5) Areas served by rural concentrated employment programs

The Governor may approve, under paragraph (2) or (3), a request for designation as a local area from an area described in section 3122(c)(1)(C) of this title .

(6) Appeals

A unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) or grant recipient that requests but is not granted designation of an area as a local area under paragraph (2) or (3) may submit an appeal to the State board under an appeal process established in the State plan. If the appeal does not result in such a designation, the Secretary of Labor, after receiving a request for review from the unit or grant recipient and on determining that the unit or grant recipient was not accorded procedural rights under the appeals process described in the State plan, as specified in section 3112(b)(2)(D)(i)(III) of this title , or that the area meets the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), may require that the area be designated as a local area under such paragraph.

(7) Redesignation assistance

On the request of all of the local areas in a planning region, the State shall provide funding from funds made available under sections 3163(a) and 3173(a)(1) of this title to assist the local areas in carrying out activities to facilitate the redesignation of the local areas to a single local area.
