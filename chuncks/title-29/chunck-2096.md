(ii) Formula

Subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), of the remainder

(iii) Calculation

In determining an allotment under clause (ii)(III) for any State in which there is an area that was designated as a local area as described in section 3122(c)(1)(C) of this title , the allotment shall be based on the higher of
