## Subtitle B— Regulatory Provisions
#### § 1053. Minimum vesting standards
##### (f) Special rules for plans computing accrued benefits by reference to hypothetical account balance or equivalent amounts

(1) In general

An applicable defined benefit plan shall not be treated as failing to meet

(A) subject to paragraph (2), the requirements of subsection (a)(2), or

(B) the requirements of section 1054(c) or 1055(g) of this title, or the requirements of subsection (e), with respect to accrued benefits derived from employer contributions, solely because the present value of the accrued benefit (or any portion thereof) of any participant is, under the terms of the plan, equal to the amount expressed as the balance in the hypothetical account described in paragraph (3) or as an accumulated percentage of the participant’s final average compensation.

(2) 3-year vesting

In the case of an applicable defined benefit plan, such plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(2) only if an employee who has completed at least 3 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee’s accrued benefit derived from employer contributions.

(3) Applicable defined benefit plan and related rules

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “applicable defined benefit plan” means a defined benefit plan under which the accrued benefit (or any portion thereof) is calculated as the balance of a hypothetical account maintained for the participant or as an accumulated percentage of the participant’s final average compensation.

(B) Regulations to include similar plans

The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations which include in the definition of an applicable defined benefit plan any defined benefit plan (or any portion of such a plan) which has an effect similar to an applicable defined benefit plan.
