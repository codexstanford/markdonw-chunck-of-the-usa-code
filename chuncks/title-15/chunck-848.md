(1) Board of directors

Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall have a board of directors.

(2) Independent directors

(A) In general

At least ½ of the board of directors, but not fewer than 2 of the members thereof, shall be independent of the nationally recognized statistical rating agency. A portion of the independent directors shall include users of ratings from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

(B) Independence determination

In order to be considered independent for purposes of this subsection, a member of the board of directors of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization

(i) may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the board of directors or any committee thereof

(I) accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the nationally recognized statistical rating organization; or

(II) be a person associated with the nationally recognized statistical rating organization or with any affiliated company thereof; and

(ii) shall be disqualified from any deliberation involving a specific rating in which the independent board member has a financial interest in the outcome of the rating.

(C) Compensation and term

The compensation of the independent members of the board of directors of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall not be linked to the business performance of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and shall be arranged so as to ensure the independence of their judgment. The term of office of the independent directors shall be for a pre-agreed fixed period, not to exceed 5 years, and shall not be renewable.

(3) Duties of board of directors

In addition to the overall responsibilities of the board of directors, the board shall oversee

(C) the effectiveness of the internal control system with respect to policies and procedures for determining credit ratings; and

(D) the compensation and promotion policies and practices of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

(4) Treatment of NRSRO subsidiaries

If a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is a subsidiary of a parent entity, the board of the directors of the parent entity may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by assigning to a committee of such board of directors the duties under paragraph (3), if

(A) at least ½ of the members of the committee (including the chairperson of the committee) are independent, as defined in this section; and

(B) at least 1 member of the committee is a user of ratings from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

(5) Exception authority

If the Commission finds that compliance with the provisions of this subsection present an unreasonable burden on a small nationally recognized statistical rating organization, the Commission may permit the nationally recognized statistical rating organization to delegate such responsibilities to a committee that includes at least one individual who is a user of ratings of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
