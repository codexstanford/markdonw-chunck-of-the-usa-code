#### § 77r–1. Preemption of State law
##### (c) Registration and qualification requirements; exemption; subsequent enactment by State

Any securities that are offered and sold pursuant to section 77d(5)  1 of this title, that are mortgage related securities (as that term is defined in section 78c(a)(41) of this title ), or that are small business related securities (as defined in section 78c(a)(53) of this title ) shall be exempt from any law of any State with respect to or requiring registration or qualification of securities or real estate to the same extent as any obligation issued by or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof. Any State may, prior to the expiration of seven years after October 3, 1984 , enact a statute that specifically refers to this section and requires registration or qualification of any such security on terms that differ from those applicable to any obligation issued by the United States.
