#### § 717z. Emergency conversion of utilities and other facilities
##### (a) Presidential declaration

The President may declare a natural gas supply emergency (or extend a previously declared emergency) if he finds that

(2) the exercise of authorities under this section is reasonably necessary, having exhausted other alternatives (not including section 3363 of this title ) to the maximum extent practicable, to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses.
