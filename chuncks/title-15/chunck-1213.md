#### § 80a–9. Ineligibility of certain affiliated persons and underwriters
##### (c) Application of ineligible person for exemption

Any person who is ineligible, by reason of subsection (a), to serve or act in the capacities enumerated in such subsection, may file with the Commission an application for an exemption from the provisions of such subsection. The Commission shall by order grant such application, either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporary or other conditional basis, if it is established that the prohibitions of such subsection (a) as applied to such person, are unduly or disproportionately severe or that the conduct of such person has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection of investors to grant such application.
