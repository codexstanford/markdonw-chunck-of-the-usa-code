(ii) immaterial; or

(B) the plaintiff fails to prove that the forward-looking statement

(i) if made by a natural person, was made with actual knowledge by that person that the statement was false or misleading; or

(ii) if made by a business entity, was

(I) made by or with the approval of an executive officer of that entity, and
