### CHAPTER 72A— CREATING HELPFUL INCENTIVES TO PRODUCE SEMICONDUCTORS FOR AMERICA
#### § 4656. Advanced microelectronics research and development
##### (c) National semiconductor technology center

(1) Establishment

Subject to the availability of appropriations for such purpose, the Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, shall establish a national semiconductor technology center to conduct research and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology and grow the domestic semiconductor workforce to strengthen the economic competitiveness and security of the domestic supply chain. Such center shall be operated as a public private-sector consortium with participation from the private sector, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation. The Secretary may make financial assistance awards, including construction awards, in support of the national semiconductor technology center.

(2) Functions

The functions of the center established under paragraph (1) shall be as follows:

(A) To conduct advanced semiconductor manufacturing, design and packaging research, and prototyping that strengthens the entire domestic ecosystem and is aligned with the strategy required under subsection (a)(3)(A) with emphasis on the following:

(i) Semiconductor advanced test, assembly, and packaging capability in the domestic ecosystem.

(ii) Materials characterization, instrumentation and testing for next generation microelectronics.

(iii) Virtualization and automation of maintenance of semiconductor machinery.

(iv) Metrology for security and supply chain verification.

(B) To establish and capitalize an investment fund, in partnership with the private sector, to support startups and collaborations between startups, academia, established companies, and new ventures, with the goal of commercializing innovations that contribute to the domestic semiconductor ecosystem, including

(i) advanced metrology and characterization for manufacturing of microchips using 3 nanometer transistor processes or more advanced processes; and

(ii) metrology for security and supply chain verification.

(C) To work with the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the National Science Foundation, the Secretary of Energy, the private sector, institutions of higher education, and workforce training entities to incentivize and expand geographically diverse participation in graduate, undergraduate, and community college programs relevant to microelectronics, including through

(i) the development and dissemination of curricula and research training experiences; and

(ii) the development of workforce training programs and apprenticeships in advanced microelectronic design, research, fabrication, and packaging capabilities.
