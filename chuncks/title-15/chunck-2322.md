### CHAPTER 14A— AID TO SMALL BUSINESS
#### § 657f. Procurement program for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans
##### (f) Database of veteran-owned businesses
######## (B) For purposes of this subsection

(i) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall

(I) verify an individual’s status as a veteran or a service-disabled veteran; and

(II) establish a system to permit the Administrator to access, but not alter, the verification of such status; and

(ii) the Administrator shall verify

(I) the status of a business concern as a small business concern; and

(II) the ownership and control of such business concern.

(C) The Administrator may not certify a concern under subsection (b) or section 657f–1 of this title if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs cannot provide the verification described under subparagraph (B)(i)(I).

(3) Information maintained in the database shall be submitted on a voluntary basis by a veteran described in paragraph (1).

(4) The Administrator shall make the database available to all Federal departments and agencies and shall notify each such department and agency of the availability of the database.

(5) If the Administrator determines that the public dissemination of certain types of information maintained in the database is inappropriate, the Administrator shall take such steps as are necessary to maintain such types of information in a secure and confidential manner.

(6)

(A) If a small business concern is not included in the database because the Administrator does not certify the status of the concern as a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans (under section 657f–1 of this title ) or a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans (under subsection (g) of this section), the concern may appeal the denial of certification to the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Administration (as established under section 634(i) of this title ). The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be considered a final agency action.

(B)

(i) If an interested party challenges the inclusion in the database of a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans or a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans based on the status of the concern as a small business concern or the ownership or control of the concern, the challenge shall be heard by the Office of Hearings and Appeals as described in subparagraph (A). The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be considered final agency action.
