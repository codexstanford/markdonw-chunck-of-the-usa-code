### CHAPTER 103— CONTROLLING THE ASSAULT OF NON-SOLICITED PORNOGRAPHY AND MARKETING
#### § 7703. Prohibition against predatory and abusive commercial e-mail
##### (c) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) Spam has become the method of choice for those who distribute pornography, perpetrate fraudulent schemes, and introduce viruses, worms, and Trojan horses into personal and business computer systems; and

(2) the Department of Justice should use all existing law enforcement tools to investigate and prosecute those who send bulk commercial e-mail to facilitate the commission of Federal crimes, including the tools contained in chapters 47 and 63 of title 18 (relating to fraud and false statements); chapter 71 of title 18 (relating to obscenity); chapter 110 of title 18 (relating to the sexual exploitation of children); and chapter 95 of title 18 (relating to racketeering), as appropriate.
