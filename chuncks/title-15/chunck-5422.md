#### § 3363. Emergency allocation authority
##### (g) Compensation

(1) In general

If the parties to any order issued under subsection (b), (c), (d), or (h) fail to agree upon the terms of compensation for natural gas deliveries or transportation required pursuant to such order, the President, after a hearing held either before or after such order takes effect, shall, by supplemental order, prescribe the amount of compensation to be paid for such deliveries or transportation and for any other expenses incurred in delivering or transporting natural gas.

(2) Calculation of compensation for certain boiler fuel natural gas

For purposes of any supplemental order under paragraph (1) with respect to emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (b), the President shall calculate the amount of compensation

(A) for supplies of natural gas based upon the amount required to make whole the user subject to the prohibition order, but in no event may such compensation exceed just compensation prescribed in section 717z of this title ; and

(B) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President.

(3) Compensation for other natural gas allocated

For the purpose of any supplemental order under paragraph (1), if the party making emergency deliveries pursuant to subsection (c) or (d)

(A) indicates a preference for compensation in kind, the President shall direct that compensation in kind be provided as expeditiously as practicable;

(B) indicates a preference for compensation, or the President determines that, notwithstanding paragraph (A) of this subsection, any portion thereof cannot practicably be compensated in kind, the President shall calculate the amount of compensation

(i) for supplies of natural gas, based upon the amount required to make the pipeline and its local distribution companies whole, in the case of any order under subsection (c), or to make the user from whom natural gas is allocated whole, in the case of any order under subsection (d) including any amount actually paid by such pipeline and its local distribution companies or such user for volumes of natural gas or higher cost synthetic gas acquired to replace natural gas subject to an order under subsection (c) or (d); and

(ii) for transportation, storage, delivery, and other services, based upon reasonable costs, as determined by the President. Compensation received by an interstate pipeline under this subsection shall be credited to the account of any local distribution company served by that pipeline to the extent ordered by the President to make such local distribution company whole.
