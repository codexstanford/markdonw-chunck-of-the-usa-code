#### § 7404. National Science Foundation computer and network security programs
##### (a) Computer and network security capacity building grants

(1) In general

The Director shall establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof) to establish or improve undergraduate and master’s degree programs in computer and network security, to increase the number of students, including the number of students from groups historically underrepresented in these fields and students who are veterans, who pursue undergraduate or master’s degrees in fields related to computer and network security, and to provide students with experience in government or industry related to their computer and network security studies.

(2) Merit review

Grants shall be awarded under this subsection on a merit-reviewed competitive basis.

(3) Use of funds

Grants awarded under this subsection shall be used for activities that enhance the ability of an institution of higher education (or consortium thereof) to provide high-quality undergraduate and master’s degree programs in computer and network security and to recruit and retain increased numbers of students to such programs. Activities may include

(A) revising curriculum to better prepare undergraduate and master’s degree students for careers in computer and network security;

(B) establishing degree and certificate programs in computer and network security;

(C) creating opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in computer and network security research projects;

(D) acquiring equipment necessary for student instruction in computer and network security, including the installation of testbed networks for student use;

(E) providing opportunities for faculty to work with local or Federal Government agencies, private industry, nonprofit research institutions, or other academic institutions to develop new expertise or to formulate new research directions in computer and network security;

(F) establishing collaborations with other academic institutions or academic departments that seek to establish, expand, or enhance programs in computer and network security;

(G) establishing student internships in computer and network security at government agencies or in private industry;

(H) establishing collaborations with other academic institutions to establish or enhance a web-based collection of computer and network security courseware and laboratory exercises for sharing with other institutions of higher education, including community colleges;

(I) establishing or enhancing bridge programs in computer and network security between community colleges and universities;

(J) creating opportunities for veterans to transition to careers in computer and network security; and

(K) any other activities the Director determines will accomplish the goals of this subsection.

(4) Selection process

(A) Application

An institution of higher education (or a consortium thereof) seeking funding under this subsection shall submit an application to the Director at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Director may require. The application shall include, at a minimum

(i) a description of the applicant’s computer and network security research and instructional capacity, and in the case of an application from a consortium of institutions of higher education, a description of the role that each member will play in implementing the proposal;

(ii) a comprehensive plan by which the institution or consortium will build instructional capacity in computer and information security;

(iii) a description of relevant collaborations with government agencies or private industry that inform the instructional program in computer and network security;

(iv) a survey of the applicant’s historic student enrollment and placement data in fields related to computer and network security and a study of potential enrollment and placement for students enrolled in the proposed computer and network security program; and

(v) a plan to evaluate the success of the proposed computer and network security program, including post-graduation assessment of graduate school and job placement and retention rates as well as the relevance of the instructional program to graduate study and to the workplace.

(B) Awards

(i) The Director shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that grants are awarded under this subsection in a wide range of geographic areas and categories of institutions of higher education, including minority serving institutions.

(ii) The Director shall award grants under this subsection for a period not to exceed 5 years.

(5) Assessment required

The Director shall evaluate the program established under this subsection no later than 6 years after the establishment of the program. At a minimum, the Director shall evaluate the extent to which the program achieved its objectives of increasing the quality and quantity of students, including students from groups historically underrepresented in computer and network security related disciplines, pursuing undergraduate or master’s degrees in computer and network security.

(6) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to the National Science Foundation to carry out this subsection

(A) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;

(B) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;

(C) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;
