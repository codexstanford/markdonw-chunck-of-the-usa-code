### CHAPTER 15B— NATURAL GAS
#### § 717c. Rates and charges
##### (f) Storage services

(1) In exercising its authority under this chapter or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ( 15 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the Commission may authorize a natural gas company (or any person that will be a natural gas company on completion of any proposed construction) to provide storage and storage-related services at market-based rates for new storage capacity related to a specific facility placed in service after August 8, 2005 , notwithstanding the fact that the company is unable to demonstrate that the company lacks market power, if the Commission determines that

(A) market-based rates are in the public interest and necessary to encourage the construction of the storage capacity in the area needing storage services; and

(B) customers are adequately protected.

(2) The Commission shall ensure that reasonable terms and conditions are in place to protect consumers.

(3) If the Commission authorizes a natural gas company to charge market-based rates under this subsection, the Commission shall review periodically whether the market-based rate is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
