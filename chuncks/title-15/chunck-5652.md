(2) The likelihood of positive regional economic effect, including increasing the number of high wage domestic jobs, creating new economic opportunities for economically disadvantaged and underrepresented populations, and building and retaining wealth in the region.

(3) How the eligible consortium plans to integrate with and leverage the resources of 1 or more federally funded research and development centers, National Laboratories, Federal laboratories, Manufacturing USA institutes, Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership centers, regional innovation engines or translation accelerators established under sections 19108 and 19109 of title 42, test beds established and operated under section 19110 of title 42 , or other Federal entities.

(4) How the eligible consortium will engage with the private sector, including small- and medium-sized businesses and cooperatives, and employee-owned businesses and cooperatives, to commercialize new technologies and improve the resiliency and sustainability of domestic supply chains in a key technology focus area, or other technology or innovation sector critical to national security and economic competitiveness.

(5) How the eligible consortium will carry out workforce development and skills acquisition programming, including through partnerships with entities that include State and local workforce development boards, institutions of higher education, including community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-serving institutions, labor organizations, nonprofit organizations, workforce development programs, and other related activities authorized by the Secretary, to support the development of a skilled technical workforce for the regional technology and innovation hub, including key technology focus area or other technology or innovation sector critical to national security and economic competitiveness.

(6) How the eligible consortium will improve or expand science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education programs and opportunities in the identified region in elementary and secondary school and higher education institutions located in the identified region to support the development of a key technology focus area or other technology or innovation sector critical to national security and economic competitiveness.

(7) How the eligible consortium plans to develop partnerships with venture development organizations, community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, and sources of private investment in support of private sector activity, including launching new or expanding existing companies in a key technology focus area or other technology or innovation sector critical to national security and economic competitiveness.

(11) How well the region’s education institutions align their activities, including research, educational programs, training, with the proposed areas of focus.

(12) The likelihood efforts served by the consortium will be sustained once Federal support ends.

(13) How the eligible consortium will, as appropriate

(A) enhance the economic, environmental, and energy security of the United States by promoting domestic development, manufacture, and deployment of innovative clean technologies and advanced manufacturing practices; and
