### CHAPTER 114— NATIONAL QUANTUM INITIATIVE
#### § 8853. Department of Energy quantum network infrastructure research and development program
##### (b) Program

In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall

(1) coordinate with

(A) the Director of the National Science Foundation;

(B) the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology;

(C) the Chair of the Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science of the National Science and Technology Council established under section 8813(a) of this title ; and

(D) the Chair of the Subcommittee on the Economic and Security Implications of Quantum Science;

(2) conduct cooperative research with industry, National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and other research institutions to facilitate new quantum infrastructure methods and technologies, including

(A) quantum-limited detectors, ultra-low loss optical channels, space-to-ground connections, and classical networking and cybersecurity protocols;

(B) entanglement and hyper-entangled state sources and transmission, control, and measurement of quantum states;

(C) quantum interconnects that allow short range local connections between quantum processors;

(D) transducers for quantum sources and signals between optical wavelength regimes, including telecommunications regimes and quantum computer-relevant domains, including microwaves;

(E) development of quantum memory buffers and small-scale quantum computers that are compatible with photon-based quantum bits in the optical or telecommunications wavelengths;

(F) long-range entanglement distribution, including allowing entanglement-based protocols between small- and large  1 scale quantum processors, at the terrestrial and space-based level using quantum repeaters and optical or laser communications;

(G) quantum routers, multiplexers, repeaters, and related technologies necessary to create secure long-distance quantum communication; and

(H) integration of systems across the quantum technology stack into traditional computing networks, including the development of remote controlled, high-performance, and reliable implementations of key quantum network components by leveraging the expertise, infrastructure and supplemental investments at the National Laboratories in the Energy Sciences Network User Facility;

(3) engage with the Quantum Economic Development Consortium and other organizations, as applicable, to transition component technologies to help facilitate as appropriate the development of a quantum supply chain for quantum network technologies;

(4) advance basic research in advanced scientific computing, particle and nuclear physics, and material science to enhance the understanding, prediction, and manipulation of materials, processes, and physical phenomena relevant to quantum network infrastructure;

(5) develop experimental tools and testbeds in collaboration with the Energy Sciences Network User Facility necessary to support cross-cutting fundamental research and development activities with diverse stakeholders from industry, National Laboratories, and institutions of higher education; and

(6) consider quantum network infrastructure applications that span the Department of Energy’s missions in energy, environment, and national security.
