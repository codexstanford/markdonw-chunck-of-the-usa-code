(ii) completes the period of Program participation as prescribed by paragraph (15);

(iii) is terminated pursuant to a termination proceeding conducted in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title ; or

(iv) is graduated pursuant to a graduation proceeding conducted in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title .

(F) For purposes of this section and section 637(a) of this title , the term “terminated” and the term “termination” means the total denial or suspension of assistance under this paragraph or under section 637(a) of this title prior to the graduation of the participating small business concern or prior to the expiration of the maximum program participation term. An action for termination shall be based upon good cause, including

(i) the failure by such concern to maintain its eligibility for Program participation;

(ii) the failure of the concern to engage in business practices that will promote its competitiveness within a reasonable period of time as evidenced by, among other indicators, a pattern of unjustified delinquent performance or terminations for default with respect to contracts awarded under the authority of section 637(a) of this title ;

For purposes of this clause, no termination action shall be taken with respect to a disadvantaged owner solely because of the conviction of an officer of the concern (who is other than a disadvantaged owner) unless such owner conspired with, abetted, or otherwise knowingly acquiesced in the activity or omission that was the basis of such officer’s conviction.

(G) The Director of the Division may initiate a termination proceeding by recommending such action to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. Whenever the Associate Administrator, or a designee of such officer, determines such termination is appropriate, within 15 days after making such a determination the Program Participant shall be provided a written notice of intent to terminate, specifying the reasons for such action. No Program Participant shall be terminated from the Program pursuant to subparagraph (F) without first being afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 637(a)(9) of this title .

(H) For the purposes of this subsection and section 637(a) of this title the term “graduated” or “graduation” means that the Program Participant is recognized as successfully completing the program by substantially achieving the targets, objectives, and goals contained in the concern’s business plan thereby demonstrating its ability to compete in the marketplace without assistance under this section or section 637(a) of this title .

(I)

(i) During the developmental stage of its participation in the Program, a Program Participant shall take all reasonable efforts within its control to attain the targets contained in its business plan for contracts awarded other than pursuant to section 637(a) of this title (hereinafter referred to as “business activity targets.”). Such efforts shall be made a part of the business plan and shall be sufficient in scope and duration to satisfy the Administration that the Program Participant will engage a reasonable marketing strategy that will maximize its potential to achieve its business activity targets.

(ii) During the transitional stage of the Program a Program Participant shall be subject to regulations regarding business activity targets that are promulgated by the Administration pursuant to clause (iii);

(iii) The regulations referred to in clause (ii) shall:

(II) require a Program Participant to attain its business activity targets;

(III) provide that, before the receipt of any contract to be awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title , the Program Participant (if it is in the transitional stage) must certify that it has complied with the regulations promulgated pursuant to subclause (II), or that it is in compliance with such remedial measures as may have been ordered pursuant to regulations issued under subclause (V);

(IV) require the Administration to review each Program Participant’s performance regarding attainment of business activity targets during periodic reviews of such Participant’s business plan; and

(V) authorize the Administration to take appropriate remedial measures with respect to a Program Participant that has failed to attain a required business activity target for the purpose of reducing such Participant’s dependence on contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title ; such remedial actions may include, but are not limited to assisting the Program Participant to expand the dollar volume of its competitive business activity or limiting the dollar volume of contracts awarded to the Program Participant pursuant to section 637(a) of this title ; except for actions that would constitute a termination, remedial measures taken pursuant to this subclause shall not be reviewable pursuant to section 637(a)(9) of this title .

(J)

(i) The Administration shall conduct an evaluation of a Program Participant’s eligibility for continued participation in the Program whenever it receives specific and credible information alleging that such Program Participant no longer meets the requirements for Program eligibility. Upon making a finding that a Program Participant is no longer eligible, the Administration shall initiate a termination proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (F). A Program Participant’s eligibility for award of any contract under the authority of section 637(a) of this title may be suspended pursuant to subpart 9.4 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).

(III) Any joint venture established under the authority of section 602(b) of Public Law 100–656 , the “Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988”, shall be eligible for award of a contract pursuant to section 637(a) of this title .
