### CHAPTER 45— EMERGENCY LOAN GUARANTEES TO BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
#### § 1845. Requirements applicable to loan guarantees
##### (a) Stock dividends or other payments, prohibition; waiver

A guarantee agreement made under this chapter with respect to an enterprise shall require that while there is any principal or interest remaining unpaid on a guaranteed loan to that enterprise the enterprise may not

(1) declare a dividend on its common stock; or

(2) make any payment on its other indebtedness to a lender whose loan has been guaranteed under this chapter. The Board may waive either or both of the requirements set forth in this subsection, as specified in the guarantee agreement covering a loan to any particular enterprise, if it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee.
