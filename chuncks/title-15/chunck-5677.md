### CHAPTER 64— METHANE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION
#### § 3801. Congressional statement of findings and declaration of policy
###### (a) The Congress finds and declares that

(1) gasoline and diesel fuel for vehicular use are in short supply and constitute a sizable portion of domestic petroleum consumption;

(2) methane use in fleet-operated vehicles would result in substantial reduction in oil imports;

(3) methane is in more abundant domestic supply than petroleum products, is the primary component of natural gas and can be derived in increased quantities from coal, biomass, waste products, and other renewable resources;

(4) recoverable methane presently available in the United States is not fully utilized;

(5) test results to date indicate that methane use as a substitute for gasoline as a motor fuel can result in emission reductions;

(6) experience to date has shown methane to be a safe motor fuel in properly modified vehicles and is therefore particularly suitable as fuel for fleet vehicles; and

(7) the introduction into commerce of methane-fueled vehicles would be expedited and facilitated by the establishment of a Federal program of research, development, and demonstration to explore and refine technologies related to methane use as a vehicular fuel.
