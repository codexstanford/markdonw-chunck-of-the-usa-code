### CHAPTER 14A— AID TO SMALL BUSINESS
#### § 644. Awards or contracts
##### (e) Procurement strategies; contract bundling

(1) In general

To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers, and each such Federal department or agency shall

(A) provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and

(B) invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director access to acquisition plans.

(2) Market research

(A) In general

Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.

(B) Factors

For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:

(i) Cost savings.

(ii) Quality improvements.

(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.

(iv) Better terms and conditions.

(v) Any other benefits.

(C) Reduction of costs not determinative

The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.

(3) Strategy specifications

If the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a justification for the determination, which shall include the following information:

(A) The specific benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements and a determination that such benefits justify the bundling.

(B) An identification of any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of bundling of contract requirements.

(C) An assessment of

(i) the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements; and

(ii) the specific actions designed to maximize participation of small business concerns as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements.

(4) Contract teaming

(A) In general

In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled or consolidated contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small business concern that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors or a joint venture of small business concerns may submit an offer for the performance of the contract.

(B) Evaluation of offers

The head of the agency shall evaluate an offer described in subparagraph (A) in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors or members of the joint venture as follows:

(i) Teams

When evaluating an offer of a small business prime contractor that includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities and past performance of the small business prime contractor.

(ii) Joint ventures

When evaluating an offer of a joint venture of small business concerns, if the joint venture does not demonstrate sufficient capabilities or past performance to be considered for award of a contract opportunity, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each member of the joint venture as the capabilities and past performance of the joint venture.

(C) Status as a small business concern

Participation of a small business concern in a team or a joint venture under this paragraph shall not affect the status of that concern as a small business concern for any other purpose.

(5) Past performance ratings of joint ventures for small business concerns

With respect to evaluating an offer for a prime contract made by a small business concern that previously participated in a joint venture with another business concern (whether or not such other business concern was a small business concern), the Administrator shall establish regulations

(A) allowing the small business concern to elect to use the past performance of the joint venture if the small business concern has no relevant past performance of its own;

(B) requiring the small business concern, when making an election under subparagraph (A)

(i) to identify to the contracting officer the joint venture of which the small business concern was a member; and

(ii) to inform the contracting officer what duties and responsibilities the small business concern carried out as part of the joint venture; and

(C) requiring a contracting officer, if the small business concern makes an election under subparagraph (A), to consider the past performance of the joint venture when evaluating the past performance of the small business concern, giving due consideration to the information provided under subparagraph (B)(ii).
