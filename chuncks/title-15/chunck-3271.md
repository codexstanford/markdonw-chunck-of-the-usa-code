#### § 1193. Flammability standards or regulations
##### (j) Final regulatory analysis; contents; publication; judicial review of regulation

(1) The Commission shall not promulgate a regulation under this section unless it has prepared a final regulatory analysis of the regulation containing the following information:

(A) A description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the regulation, including costs and benefits that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs.

(B) A description of any alternatives to the final regulation which were considered by the Commission, together with a summary description of their potential benefits and costs and a brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were not chosen.

(C) A summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues. The Commission shall publish its final regulatory analysis with the regulation.

(2) The Commission shall not promulgate a regulation under this section unless it finds (and includes such finding in the regulation)

(A) in the case of a regulation which relates to a risk of injury with respect to which persons who would be subject to such regulation have adopted and implemented a voluntary standard, that

(i) compliance with such voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury; or

(ii) it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standard;

(B) that the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and

(C) that the regulation imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the regulation is being promulgated.

(3)

(A) Any regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (i) or paragraph (1) shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a regulation is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.

(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.
