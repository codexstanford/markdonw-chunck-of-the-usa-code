#### § 7501. National Nanotechnology Program
##### (c) Program management

The National Science and Technology Council shall oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program. The Council, itself or through an appropriate subgroup it designates or establishes, shall

(1) establish goals and priorities for the Program, based on national needs for a set of broad applications of nanotechnology;

(2) establish program component areas, with specific priorities and technical goals, that reflect the goals and priorities established for the Program;

(3) oversee interagency coordination of the Program, including with the activities of the Defense Nanotechnology Research and Development Program established under section 246 of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 ( Public Law 107–314 ) and the National Institutes of Health;

(4) develop, not later than 5 years after the date of the release of the most-recent strategic plan, and update every 5 years thereafter, a strategic plan to guide the activities described under subsection (b) that describes

(A) the near-term and long-term objectives for the Program;

(B) the anticipated schedule for achieving the near-term objectives; and  1

(C) the metrics that will be used to assess progress toward the near-term and long-term objectives;

(D) how the Program will move results out of the laboratory and into application for the benefit of society;

(E) the Program’s support for long-term funding for interdisciplinary research and development in nanotechnology; and

(F) the allocation of funding for interagency nanotechnology projects;

(5) propose a coordinated interagency budget for the Program to the Office of Management and Budget to ensure the maintenance of a balanced nanotechnology research portfolio and an appropriate level of research effort;

(6) exchange information with academic, industry, State and local government (including State and regional nanotechnology programs), and other appropriate groups conducting research on and using nanotechnology;

(7) develop a plan to utilize Federal programs, such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Research Program, in support of the activity stated in subsection (b)(7);

(8) identify research areas that are not being adequately addressed by the agencies’ current research programs and address such research areas;

(9) encourage progress on Program activities through the utilization of existing manufacturing facilities and industrial infrastructures such as, but not limited to, the employment of underutilized manufacturing facilities in areas of high unemployment as production engineering and research testbeds; and

(10) in carrying out its responsibilities under paragraphs (1) through (9), take into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Panel, suggestions or recommendations developed pursuant to subsection (b)(10)(D), and the views of academic, State, industry, and other appropriate groups conducting research on and using nanotechnology.
