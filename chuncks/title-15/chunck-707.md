In accordance with this objective, the Commission shall, at least 15 days prior to the issuance for public comment of any proposed rule or regulation under this section concerning security futures products, consult and request the views of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

(2) Application of rules by order of CFTC

No rule adopted pursuant to this section shall be applied to any person with respect to the trading of security futures products on an exchange that is registered under section 78f(g) of this title unless the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued an order directing that such rule is applicable to such persons.
