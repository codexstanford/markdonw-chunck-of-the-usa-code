### CHAPTER 36— CIGARETTE LABELING AND ADVERTISING
#### § 1333. Labeling
##### (e) Tar, nicotine, and other smoke constituent disclosure

(1) In general

The Secretary shall, by a rulemaking conducted under section 553 of title 5 , determine (in the Secretary’s sole discretion) whether cigarette and other tobacco product manufacturers shall be required to include in the area of each cigarette advertisement specified by subsection (b) of this section, or on the package label, or both, the tar and nicotine yields of the advertised or packaged brand. Any such disclosure shall be in accordance with the methodology established under such regulations, shall conform to the type size requirements of subsection (b) of this section, and shall appear within the area specified in subsection (b) of this section.

(2) Resolution of differences

Any differences between the requirements established by the Secretary under paragraph (1) and tar and nicotine yield reporting requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission shall be resolved by a memorandum of understanding between the Secretary and the Federal Trade Commission.

(3) Cigarette and other tobacco product constituents

In addition to the disclosures required by paragraph (1), the Secretary may, under a rulemaking conducted under section 553 of title 5 , prescribe disclosure requirements regarding the level of any cigarette or other tobacco product constituent including any smoke constituent. Any such disclosure may be required if the Secretary determines that disclosure would be of benefit to the public health, or otherwise would increase consumer awareness of the health consequences of the use of tobacco products, except that no such prescribed disclosure shall be required on the face of any cigarette package or advertisement. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Secretary from requiring such prescribed disclosure through a cigarette or other tobacco product package or advertisement insert, or by any other means under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].

(4) Retailers

This subsection applies to a retailer only if that retailer is responsible for or directs the label statements required under this section.
