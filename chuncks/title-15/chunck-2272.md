##### (c) Conditions of participation

(1) Non-Federal contributions

As a condition of receiving financial assistance authorized by this section, the recipient organization shall agree to obtain, after its application has been approved and notice of award has been issued, cash contributions from non-Federal sources as follows:

(A) in the first and second years, 1 non-Federal dollar for each 2 Federal dollars; and

(B) in the third, fourth, and fifth years, 1 non-Federal dollar for each Federal dollar.

(2) Form of non-Federal contributions

Not more than one-half of the non-Federal sector matching assistance may be in the form of in-kind contributions that are budget line items only, including office equipment and office space.

(3) Form of Federal contributions

The financial assistance authorized pursuant to this section may be made by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement and may contain such provision, as necessary, to provide for payments in lump sum or installments, and in advance or by way of reimbursement. The Administration may disburse up to 25 percent of each year’s Federal share awarded to a recipient organization after notice of the award has been issued and before the non-Federal sector matching funds are obtained.

(4) Failure to obtain non-Federal funding

If any recipient of assistance fails to obtain the required non-Federal contribution during any project, it shall not be eligible thereafter for advance disbursements pursuant to paragraph (3) during the remainder of that project, or for any other project for which it is or may be funded by the Administration, and prior to approving assistance to such organization for any other projects, the Administration shall specifically determine whether the Administration believes that the recipient will be able to obtain the requisite non-Federal funding and enter a written finding setting forth the reasons for making such determination.
