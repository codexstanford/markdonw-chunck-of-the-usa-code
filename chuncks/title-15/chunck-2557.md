#### § 694b. Surety bond guarantees
##### (b) Indemnification of surety against loss from avoiding breach

Subject to the provisions of this section, in connection with the issuance by the Administration of a guarantee to a surety as provided by subsection (a), the Administration may agree to indemnify such surety against a loss sustained by such surety in avoiding or attempting to avoid a breach of the terms of a bond guaranteed by the Administration pursuant to subsection (a): Provided, however

(1) prior to making any payment under this subsection, the Administration shall first determine that a breach of the terms of such bond was imminent;

(2) a surety must obtain approval from the Administration prior to making any payments pursuant to this subsection unless the surety is participating under the authority of subsection (a)(3); and

(3) no payment by the Administration pursuant to this subsection shall exceed 10 per centum of the contract price unless the Administrator determines that a greater payment should be made as a result of a finding by the Administrator that the surety’s loss sustained in avoiding or attempting to avoid such breach was necessary and reasonable. In no event shall the Administration pay a surety pursuant to this subsection an amount exceeding the guaranteed share of the bond available to such surety pursuant to subsection (a).
