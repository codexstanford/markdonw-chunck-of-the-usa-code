#### § 9011. Subsidy for certain loan payments
##### (b) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) all borrowers are adversely affected by COVID–19;

(2) relief payments by the Administration are appropriate for all borrowers; and

(3) in addition to the relief provided under this Act, the Administration should encourage lenders to provide payment deferments, when appropriate, and to extend the maturity of covered loans, so as to avoid balloon payments or any requirement for increases in debt payments resulting from deferments provided by lenders during the period of the national emergency declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19).
