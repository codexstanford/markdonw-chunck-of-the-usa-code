The Small Business Administration, after consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Intergovernmental Affairs Division of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within one hundred and twenty days of July 22, 1982 , issue policy directives for the general conduct of the SBIR programs within the Federal Government, including providing for

(A) simplified, standardized, and timely SBIR solicitations;

(C) exemptions from the regulations under paragraph (2)  4 if national security or intelligence functions clearly would be jeopardized;

(D) minimizing regulatory burden associated with participation in the SBIR program for the small business concern which will stimulate the cost-effective conduct of Federal research and development and the likelihood of commercialization of the results of research and development conducted under the SBIR program;

(E) simplified, standardized, and timely annual report on the SBIR program to the Small Business Administration and the Office of Science and Technology Policy;

(2) Modifications

Not later than 90 days after October 28, 1992 , the Administrator shall modify the policy directives issued pursuant to this subsection to provide for

(A) retention by a small business concern of the rights to data generated by the concern in the performance of an SBIR award for a period of not less than 4 years;

(C) procedures to ensure, to the extent practicable, that an agency which intends to pursue research, development, or production of a technology developed by a small business concern under an SBIR program enters into follow-on, non-SBIR funding agreements with the small business concern for such research, development, or production;

(D) an increase to $150,000 in the amount of funds which an agency may award in Phase I of an SBIR program, and to $1,000,000 in Phase II of an SBIR program, and an adjustment of such amounts every year for inflation;

(G) technical and programmatic guidance to encourage agencies to develop gap-funding programs to address the delay between an award for Phase I of an SBIR program and the application for and extension of an award for Phase II of such program;

(H) procedures to ensure that a small business concern that submits a proposal for a funding agreement for Phase I of an SBIR program and that has received more than 15 Phase II SBIR awards during the preceding 5 fiscal years is able to demonstrate the extent to which it was able to secure Phase III funding to develop concepts resulting from previous Phase II SBIR awards; and

(I) procedures to ensure that agencies participating in the SBIR program retain the information submitted under subparagraph (H) at least until the Government Accountability Office submits the report required under section 105 of the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992.

(B) to provide for the requirement of a succinct commercialization plan with each application for a Phase II award that is moving toward commercialization;

(C) to require agencies to report to the Administration, not less frequently than annually, all instances in which an agency pursued research, development, or production of a technology developed by a small business concern using an award made under the SBIR program of that agency, and determined that it was not practicable to enter into a follow-on non-SBIR program funding agreement with the small business concern, which report shall include, at a minimum

(i) the reasons why the follow-on funding agreement with the small business concern was not practicable;

(ii) the identity of the entity with which the agency contracted to perform the research, development, or production; and
