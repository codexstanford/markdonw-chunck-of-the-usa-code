#### § 3724. Crowdsourcing and citizen science
##### (b) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the authority granted to Federal agencies under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( Public Law 111–358 ; 124 Stat. 3982 ) to pursue the use of incentive prizes and challenges has yielded numerous benefits;

(2) crowdsourcing and citizen science projects have a number of additional unique benefits, including accelerating scientific research, increasing cost effectiveness to maximize the return on taxpayer dollars, addressing societal needs, providing hands-on learning in STEM, and connecting members of the public directly to Federal science agency missions and to each other; and

(3) granting Federal science agencies the direct, explicit authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will encourage its appropriate use to advance Federal science agency missions and stimulate and facilitate broader public participation in the innovation process, yielding numerous benefits to the Federal Government and citizens who participate in such projects.
