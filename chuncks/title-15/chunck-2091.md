#### § 638. Research and development
##### (aa) Limitation on size of awards

(1) Limitation

No Federal agency may issue an award under the SBIR program or the STTR program if the size of the award exceeds the award guidelines established under this section by more than 50 percent.

(2) Maintenance of information

Participating agencies shall maintain information on awards exceeding the guidelines established under this section, including

(A) the amount of each award;

(B) a justification for exceeding the guidelines for each award;

(C) the identity and location of each award recipient; and

(D) whether an award recipient has received any venture capital, hedge fund, or private equity firm investment and, if so, whether the recipient is majority-owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms.

(3) Reports

The Administrator shall include the information described in paragraph (2) in the annual report of the Administrator to Congress.

(4) Waiver for specific topic

Upon the receipt of an application from a Federal agency, the Administrator may grant a waiver from the requirement under paragraph (1) with respect to a specific topic (but not for the agency as a whole) for a fiscal year if the Administrator determines, based on the information contained in the application from the agency, that

(A) the requirement under paragraph (1) will interfere with the ability of the agency to fulfill its research mission through the SBIR program or the STTR program; and

(B) the agency will minimize, to the maximum extent possible, the number of awards that do not satisfy the requirement under paragraph (1) to preserve the nature and intent of the SBIR program and the STTR program.

(5) Rule of construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a Federal agency from supplementing an award under the SBIR program or the STTR program using funds of the Federal agency that are not part of the SBIR program or the STTR program of the Federal agency.
