##### (a) Temporary injunction; venue

Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any person is violating or is about to violate section 1192 of this title , or a rule or regulation prescribed under section 1194(c) of this title , and that it would be in the public interest to enjoin such violation until complaint under the Federal Trade Commission Act [ 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] is issued and dismissed by the Commission or until order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act or is set aside by the court on review, the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or transacts business, or, if such person resides or transacts business in Guam or the Virgin Islands, then in the District Court of Guam or in the District Court of the Virgin Islands (as the case may be), to enjoin such violation and upon proper showing a temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.
