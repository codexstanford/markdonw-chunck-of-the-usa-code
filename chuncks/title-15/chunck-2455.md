#### § 687l. Issuance and guarantee of trust certificates
##### (b) Terms and conditions of guarantee; payment of principal and interest

The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this section. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed debentures or the redemption price of and priority payments on the participating securities, which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a debenture in such trust or pool is prepaid, or participating securities are redeemed, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or in the event of default of a debenture or voluntary or involuntary redemption of a participating security, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid debenture or redeemed participating security and priority payments represent in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted debentures, or priority payments on participating securities, shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all debentures or redemption, whether voluntary or involuntary, of all participating securities residing in the pool.
