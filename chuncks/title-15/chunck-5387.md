### CHAPTER 59— RETAIL POLICIES FOR NATURAL GAS UTILITIES
#### § 3203. Adoption of certain standards
##### (b) Establishment

The following Federal standards are hereby established:

(1) Procedures for termination of natural gas service

No gas utility may terminate natural gas service to any gas consumer except pursuant to procedures described in section 3204(a) of this title .

(2) Advertising

No gas utility may recover from any person other than the shareholders (or other owners) of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for promotional or political advertising as defined in section 3204(b) of this title .

(3) Integrated resource planning

Each gas utility shall employ, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its gas customers at the lowest system cost. All plans or filings of a State regulated gas utility before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph shall (A) be updated on a regular basis, (B) provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, (C) provide for methods of validating predicted performance, and (D) contain a requirement that the plan be implemented after approval of the State regulatory authority. Subsection (c) shall not apply to this paragraph to the extent that it could be construed to require the State regulatory authority to extend the record of a State proceeding in submitting reports to the Federal Government.

(4) Investments in conservation and demand management

The rates charged by any State regulated gas utility shall be such that the utility’s prudent investments in, and expenditures for, energy conservation and load shifting programs and for other demand-side management measures which are consistent with the findings and purposes of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 are at least as profitable (taking into account the income lost due to reduced sales resulting from such programs) as prudent investments in, and expenditures for, the acquisition or construction of supplies and facilities. This objective requires that (A) regulators link the utility’s net revenues, at least in part, to the utility’s performance in implementing cost-effective programs promoted by this section; and (B) regulators ensure that, for purposes of recovering fixed costs, including its authorized return, the utility’s performance is not affected by reductions in its retail sales volumes.

(5) Energy efficiency

Each natural gas utility shall

(A) integrate energy efficiency resources into the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility; and

(B) adopt policies that establish energy efficiency as a priority resource in the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility.

(6) Rate design modifications to promote energy efficiency investments

(A) In general

The rates allowed to be charged by a natural gas utility shall align utility incentives with the deployment of cost-effective energy efficiency.

(B) Policy options

In complying with subparagraph (A), each State regulatory authority and each nonregulated utility shall consider

(i) separating fixed-cost revenue recovery from the volume of transportation or sales service provided to the customer;

(ii) providing to utilities incentives for the successful management of energy efficiency programs, such as allowing utilities to retain a portion of the cost-reducing benefits accruing from the programs;

(iii) promoting the impact on adoption of energy efficiency as 1 of the goals of retail rate design, recognizing that energy efficiency must be balanced with other objectives; and

(iv) adopting rate designs that encourage energy efficiency for each customer class. For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter  3 to this paragraph, any reference in this chapter  3 to November 9, 1978 , shall be treated as a reference to December 19, 2007 .
