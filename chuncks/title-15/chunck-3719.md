### CHAPTER 41— CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION
#### § 1639. Requirements for certain mortgages
##### (f) No negative amortization

A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)  1 of this title may not include terms under which the outstanding principal balance will increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount of interest due.
