##### (d) Authority to suspend on criminal charges

(1) In general

Whenever a management official is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, with the commission of or participation in a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the Administrator may, by written notice served upon that management official, suspend that management official from office or prohibit that management official from further participation in any manner in the management or conduct of the affairs of the licensee, or both.

(2) Effectiveness

A suspension or prohibition under paragraph (1) shall remain in effect until the subject information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of, or until terminated by the Administrator.

(3) Authority upon conviction

If a judgment of conviction with respect to an offense described in paragraph (1) is entered against a management official, then at such time as the judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Administrator may issue and serve upon the management official an order removing that management official, which removal shall become effective upon service of a copy of the order upon the licensee.

(4) Authority upon dismissal or other disposition

A finding of not guilty or other disposition of charges described in paragraph (1) shall not preclude the Administrator from thereafter instituting proceedings to suspend or remove the management official from office, or to prohibit the management official from participation in the management or conduct of the affairs of the licensee, or both, pursuant to subsection (b) or (c).
