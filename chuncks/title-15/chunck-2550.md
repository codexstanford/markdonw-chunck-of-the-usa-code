#### § 694–1. Planning design or installation of pollution control facilities
##### (c) Uniform annual fees; processing fees; time and condition for payment; periodic review

The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for any guarantee issued under this section which shall be payable at such time and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The fee shall be set at an amount which the Administration deems reasonable and necessary and shall be subject to periodic review in order that the lowest fee that experience under the program shows to be justified will be placed into effect. In no case shall such amount be less than 1 per centum or more than 3½ per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any qualified contract guaranteed under this section. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administrative expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.
