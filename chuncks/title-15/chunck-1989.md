######## (I) Thirty days before the conclusion of each fiscal year, the Director of the Division shall review all concerns that have been admitted into the Program during the preceding 12-month period. The review shall ascertain the number of entrants, their geographic distribution and industrial classification. The Director shall also estimate the expected growth of the Program during the next fiscal year and the number of additional Business Opportunity Specialists, if any, that will be needed to meet the anticipated demand for the Program. The findings and conclusions of the Director shall be reported to the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development by September 30 of each year. Based on such report and such additional data as may be relevant, the Associate Administrator shall, by October 31 of each year, issue policy and program directives applicable to such fiscal year that

(i) establish priorities for the solicitation of program applications from underrepresented regions and industry categories;

(ii) assign staffing levels and allocate other program resources as necessary to meet program needs; and

(iii) establish priorities in the processing and admission of new Program Participants as may be necessary to achieve an equitable geographic distribution of concerns and a distribution of concerns across all industry categories in proportions needed to increase significantly contract awards to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. When considering such increase the Administration shall give due consideration to those industrial categories where Federal purchases have been substantial but where the participation rate of such concerns has been limited.

(12)

(A) The Administration shall segment the Capital Ownership Development Program into two stages: a developmental stage; and a transitional stage.

(B) The developmental stage of program participation shall be designed to assist the concern in its effort to overcome its economic disadvantage by providing such assistance as may be necessary and appropriate to access its markets and to strengthen its financial and managerial skills.

(C) The transitional stage of program participation shall be designed to overcome, insofar as practicable, the remaining elements of economic disadvantage and to prepare such concern for graduation from the program.

(13) A Program Participant, if otherwise eligible, shall be qualified to receive the following assistance during the stages of program participation specified in paragraph 12:  18

(A) Contract support pursuant to section 637(a) of this title .

No exemption shall be made pursuant to this subparagraph if the contract to which it pertains has an anticipated value in excess of $10,000,000. This subparagraph shall cease to be effective on October 1, 1992 .

(D) A maximum of five exemptions from the requirements of sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40, which exemptions shall apply only to contracts awarded pursuant to section 637(a) of this title , except that, such exemptions may be granted under this subparagraph only if

(ii) the Administration and the agency providing the contracting opportunity have provided for the protection of persons furnishing materials or labor to the Program Participant by arranging for the direct disbursement of funds due to such persons by the procuring agency or through any bank the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and

Such assistance may be made without regard to section 647(a) of this title . Assistance may be made by direct payment to the training provider or by reimbursing the Program Participant or the Participant’s employee, if such reimbursement is found to be reasonable and appropriate.

(i) such concern has documented that it has first explored the use of existing cost-free or cost-subsidized training programs offered by public and private sector agencies working with programs of employment and training and economic development;

(ii) no more than five employees or potential employees of such concern are recipients of any benefits under this subparagraph at any one time;
