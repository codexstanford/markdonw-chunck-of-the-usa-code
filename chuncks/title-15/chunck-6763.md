#### § 7403. National Science Foundation research
##### (b) Computer and network security research centers

(1) In general

The Director shall award multiyear grants, subject to the availability of appropriations, to institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, or consortia thereof to establish multidisciplinary Centers for Computer and Network Security Research. Institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, or consortia thereof receiving such grants may partner with 1 or more government laboratories or for-profit institutions, or other institutions of higher education or nonprofit research institutions.

(2) Merit review; competition

Grants shall be awarded under this subsection on a merit-reviewed competitive basis.

(3) Purpose

The purpose of the Centers shall be to generate innovative approaches to computer and network security by conducting cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research in computer and network security, including improving the security and resiliency of information technology, reducing cyber vulnerabilities, and anticipating and mitigating consequences of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, by conducting research in the areas described in subsection (a)(1).

(4) Applications

(B) the experience of the applicant in conducting research on computer and network security and the capacity of the applicant to foster new multidisciplinary collaborations;

(C) the capacity of the applicant to attract and provide adequate support for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to pursue computer and network security research;

(D) the extent to which the applicant will partner with government laboratories, for-profit entities, other institutions of higher education, or nonprofit research institutions, and the role the partners will play in the research undertaken by the Center;

(E) the demonstrated capability of the applicant to conduct high performance computation integral to complex computer and network security research, through on-site or off-site computing;

(F) the applicant’s affiliation with private sector entities involved with industrial research described in subsection (a)(1);

(G) the capability of the applicant to conduct research in a secure environment;

(H) the applicant’s affiliation with existing research programs of the Federal Government;

(I) the applicant’s experience managing public-private partnerships to transition new technologies into a commercial setting or the government user community;

(J) the capability of the applicant to conduct interdisciplinary cybersecurity research, basic and applied, such as in law, economics, or behavioral sciences; and

(K) the capability of the applicant to conduct research in areas such as systems security, wireless security, networking and protocols, formal methods and networking and information technology, nanotechnology, or industrial control systems.

(6) Annual meeting

The Director shall convene an annual meeting of the Centers in order to foster collaboration and communication between Center participants.

(7) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated for the National Science Foundation to carry out this subsection

(A) $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;

(B) $24,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;

(C) $36,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;
