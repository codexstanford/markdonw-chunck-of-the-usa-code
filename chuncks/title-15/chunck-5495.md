### CHAPTER 62— CONDOMINIUM AND COOPERATIVE CONVERSION PROTECTION AND ABUSE RELIEF
#### § 3608. Judicial determinations respecting uncon­scionable leases
##### (d) Remedial relief; matters considered; attorneys’ fees

Upon finding that any lease, or portion thereof, is unconscionable, the court shall exercise its authority to grant remedial relief as necessary to avoid an unconscionable result, taking into consideration the economic value of the lease. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to rescission, reformation, restitution, the award of damages and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. A defendant may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees if the court determines that the cause of action filed by the plantiff  1 is frivolous, malicious, or lacking in substantial merit.
