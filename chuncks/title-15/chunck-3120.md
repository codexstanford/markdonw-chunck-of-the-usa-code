#### § 1066a. Ex parte expungement
##### (c) Initial determination; institution

(1) Prima facie case determination, institution, and notification

The Director shall, for each good or service identified under subsection (b)(2), determine whether the petition sets forth a prima facie case of the mark having never been used in commerce on or in connection with each such good or service, institute an ex parte expungement proceeding for each good or service for which the Director determines that a prima facie case has been set forth, and provide a notice to the registrant and petitioner of the determination of whether or not the proceeding was instituted. Such notice shall include a copy of the petition and any supporting documents and evidence that were included with the petition.

(2) Reasonable investigation guidance

The Director shall promulgate regulations regarding what constitutes a reasonable investigation under subsection (b)(3) and the general types of evidence that could support a prima facie case that a mark has never been used in commerce, but the Director shall retain the discretion to determine whether a prima facie case is set out in a particular proceeding.

(3) Determination by Director

Any determination by the Director whether or not to institute a proceeding under this section shall be final and non-reviewable, and shall not prejudice any party’s right to raise any issue and rely on any evidence in any other proceeding, except as provided in subsection (j).
