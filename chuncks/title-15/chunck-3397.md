### CHAPTER 30— HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
#### § 1278a. Children’s products containing lead; lead paint rule
##### (b) Exclusion of certain materials or products and inaccessible component parts

(1) Functional purpose exception

(A) In general

The Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by an interested party, shall grant an exception to the limit in subsection (a) for a specific product, class of product, material, or component part if the Commission, after notice and a hearing, determines that

(i) the product, class of product, material, or component part requires the inclusion of lead because it is not practicable or not technologically feasible to manufacture such product, class of product, material, or component part, as the case may be, in accordance with subsection (a) by removing the excessive lead or by making the lead inaccessible;

(ii) the product, class of product, material, or component part is not likely to be placed in the mouth or ingested, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, class of product, material, or component part by a child; and

(iii) an exception for the product, class of product, material, or component part will have no measurable adverse effect on public health or safety, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse.

(B) Measurement

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), there is no measurable adverse effect on public health or safety if the exception described in subparagraph (A) will result in no measurable increase in blood lead levels of a child. The Commission may adopt an alternative method of measurement other than blood lead levels if it determines, after notice and a hearing, that such alternative method is a better scientific method for measuring adverse effect on public health and safety.

(C) Procedures for granting exception

(i) Burden of proof

A party seeking an exception under subparagraph (A) has the burden of demonstrating that it meets the requirements of such subparagraph.

(ii) Grounds for decision

In the case where a party has petitioned for an exception, in determining whether to grant the exception, the Commission may base its decision solely on the materials presented by the party seeking the exception and any materials received through notice and a hearing.

(iii) Admissible evidence

In demonstrating that it meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), a party seeking an exception under such subparagraph may rely on any nonproprietary information submitted by any other party seeking such an exception and such information shall be considered part of the record presented by the party that relies on that information.

(iv) Scope of exception

If an exception is sought for an entire product, the burden is on the petitioning party to demonstrate that the criteria in subparagraph (A) are met with respect to every accessible component or accessible material of the product.

(D) Limitation on exception

If the Commission grants an exception for a product, class of product, material, or component part under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, as necessary to protect public health or safety

(i) establish a lead limit that such product, class of product, material, or component part may not exceed; or

(ii) place a manufacturing expiration date on such exception or establish a schedule after which the manufacturer of such product, class of product, material, or component part shall be in full compliance with the limit established under clause (i) or the limit set forth in subsection (a).

(E) Application of exception

An exception under subparagraph (A) for a product, class of product, material, or component part shall apply regardless of the date of manufacture unless the Commission expressly provides otherwise.

(F) Previously submitted petitions

A party seeking an exception under this paragraph may rely on materials previously submitted in connection with a petition for exclusion under this section. In such cases, petitioners must notify the Commission of their intent to rely on materials previously submitted. Such reliance does not affect petitioners’ obligation to demonstrate that they meet all requirements of this paragraph as required by subparagraph (C)(i).

(2) Exception for inaccessible component parts

(A) In general

The limits established under subsection (a) shall not apply to any component part of a children’s product that is not accessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, as determined by the Commission. A component part is not accessible under this subparagraph if such component part is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product. Reasonably foreseeable use and abuse shall include swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children’s activities, and the aging of the product.

(B) Inaccessibility proceeding

Within 1 year after August 14, 2008 , the Commission shall promulgate a rule providing guidance with respect to what product components, or classes of components, will be considered to be inaccessible for purposes of subparagraph (A).

(C) Application pending CPSC guidance

Until the Commission promulgates a rule pursuant to subparagraph (B), the determination of whether a product component is inaccessible to a child shall be made in accordance with the requirements laid out in subparagraph (A) for considering a component to be inaccessible to a child.

(3) Certain barriers disqualified

For purposes of this subsection, paint, coatings, or electroplating may not be considered to be a barrier that would render lead in the substrate inaccessible to a child, or to prevent absorption of any lead into the human body, through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.

(4) Certain electronic devices

If the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible for certain electronic devices, including devices containing batteries, to comply with subsection (a), the Commission, by regulation, shall

(A) issue requirements to eliminate or minimize the potential for exposure to and accessibility of lead in such electronic devices, which may include requirements that such electronic devices be equipped with a child-resistant cover or casing that prevents exposure to and accessibility of the parts of the product containing lead; and

(B) establish a schedule by which such electronic devices shall be in full compliance with the limits in subsection (a), unless the Commission determines that full compliance will not be technologically feasible for such devices within a schedule set by the Commission.

(5) Exception for off-highway vehicles

(A) In general

Subsection (a) shall not apply to an off-highway vehicle.

(B) Off-highway vehicle defined

For purposes of this section, the term “off-highway vehicle”

(i) means any motorized vehicle

(I) that is manufactured primarily for use off public streets, roads, and highways;

(II) designed to travel on 2, 3, or 4 wheels; and

(III) that has either

(aa) a seat designed to be straddled by the operator and handlebars for steering control; or

(bb) a nonstraddle seat, steering wheel, seat belts, and roll-over protective structure; and

(ii) includes a snowmobile.

(6) Bicycles and related products

In lieu of the lead limits established in subsection (a)(2), the limits set forth for each respective material in the notice of the Commission entitled “Notice of Stay of Enforcement Pertaining to Bicycles and Related Products”, published June 30, 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 31254), shall apply to any metal component part of the products to which the stay of enforcement described in such notice applies, except that after December 31, 2011 , the limits set forth in such notice shall not be more than 300 parts per million total lead content by weight for any metal component part of the products to which such stay pertains.

(7) Exclusion of certain used children’s products

(A) General exclusion

The lead limits established under subsection (a) shall not apply to a used children’s product.

(B) Definition

In this paragraph, the term “used children’s product” means a children’s product (as defined in section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act ( 15 U.S.C. 2052(a) )  1 that was obtained by the seller for use and not for the purpose of resale or was obtained by the seller, either directly or indirectly, from a person who obtained such children’s product for use and not for the purpose of resale. Such term also includes a children’s product that was donated to the seller for charitable distribution or resale to support charitable purposes. Such term shall not include

(i) children’s metal jewelry;

(ii) any children’s product for which the donating party or the seller has actual knowledge that the product is in violation of the lead limits in this section; or

(iii) any other children’s product or product category that the Commission determines, after notice and a hearing. For purposes of this definition, the term “seller” includes a person who lends or donates a used children’s product.

(8) Periodic review

The Commission shall, based on the best available scientific and technical information, periodically review and revise the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection no less frequently than every 5 years after the first promulgation of a regulation under this subsection to make them more stringent and to require the lowest amount of lead the Commission determines is technologically feasible to achieve.
