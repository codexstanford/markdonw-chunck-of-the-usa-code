#### § 6753. Membership
##### (d) Membership criteria

(1) In general

The Association may establish criteria for membership which shall include standards for personal qualifications, education, training, and experience. The Association shall not establish criteria that unfairly limit the ability of a small insurance producer to become a member of the Association, including imposing discriminatory membership fees.

(2) Qualifications

In establishing criteria under paragraph (1), the Association shall not adopt any qualification less protective to the public than that contained in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (referred to in this subchapter as the “NAIC”) Producer Licensing Model Act in effect as of January 12, 2015 , and shall consider the highest levels of insurance producer qualifications established under the licensing laws of the States.

(3) Assistance from States

(A) In general

The Association may request a State to provide assistance in investigating and evaluating the eligibility of a prospective member for membership in the Association.

(B) Authorization of information sharing

A submission under subsection (a)(4)(C)(i) made by an insurance producer licensed in a State shall include a statement signed by the person about whom the assistance is requested authorizing

(i) the State to share information with the Association; and

(ii) the Association to receive the information.

(C) Rule of construction

Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as requiring or authorizing any State to adopt new or additional requirements concerning the licensing or evaluation of insurance producers.

(4) Denial of membership

The Association may, based on reasonably consistently applied standards, deny membership to any State-licensed insurance producer for failure to meet the membership criteria established by the Association.
