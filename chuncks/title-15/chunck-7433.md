(i) the eligible business has issued securities that are traded on a national securities exchange; and

(ii) the Secretary receives a warrant or equity interest in the eligible business; or

(i) a warrant or equity interest in the eligible business; or

(ii) a senior debt instrument issued by the eligible business.

(2) Terms and conditions

The terms and conditions of any warrant, equity interest, or senior debt instrument received under paragraph (1) shall be set by the Secretary and shall meet the following requirements:

(A) Purposes

Such terms and conditions shall be designed to provide for a reasonable participation by the Secretary, for the benefit of taxpayers, in equity appreciation in the case of a warrant or other equity interest, or a reasonable interest rate premium, in the case of a debt instrument.

For the primary benefit of taxpayers, the Secretary may sell, exercise, or surrender a warrant or any senior debt instrument received under this subsection. The Secretary shall not exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock acquired under this section.
