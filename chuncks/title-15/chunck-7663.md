#### § 9451. Artificial intelligence research and education
##### (d) Ethics

(1) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(A) a number of emerging areas of research, including artificial intelligence, have potential ethical, social, safety, and security risks that might be apparent as early as the basic research stage;

(B) the incorporation of ethical, social, safety, and security considerations into the research design and review process for Federal awards may help mitigate potential harms before they happen;

(C) the National Science Foundation’s agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study and make recommendations with respect to governance of research in computing and computing technologies is a positive step toward accomplishing this goal; and

(D) the National Science Foundation should continue to work with stakeholders to understand and adopt policies that promote best practices for governance of research in emerging technologies at every stage of research.

(2) Report on ethics statements

No later than 6 months after publication of the study described in paragraph (1)(C), the Director shall report to Congress on options for requiring an ethics or risk statement as part of all or a subset of applications for research funding to the National Science Foundation.
