#### § 631. Declaration of policy
##### (j) Contract bundling

In complying with the statement of congressional policy expressed in subsection (a), relating to fostering the participation of small business concerns in the contracting opportunities of the Government, each Federal agency, to the maximum extent practicable, shall

(1) comply with congressional intent to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers;

(2) structure its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to their participation; and

(3) avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contract requirements that precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors.
