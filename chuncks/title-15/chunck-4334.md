### CHAPTER 45— EMERGENCY LOAN GUARANTEES TO BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
#### § 1845. Requirements applicable to loan guarantees
##### (e) Protective provisions; advances

(1) Prior to making any guarantee under this chapter, the Board shall satisfy itself that the underlying loan agreement on which the guarantee is sought contains all the affirmative and negative covenants and other protective provisions which are usual and customary in loan agreements of a similar kind, including previous loan agreements between the lender and the borrower, and that it cannot be amended, or any provisions waived, without the Board’s prior consent.

(2) On each occasion when the borrower seeks an advance under the loan agreement, the guarantee authorized by this chapter shall be in force as to the funds advanced only if

(A) the lender gives the Board at least ten days’ notice in writing of its intent to provide the borrower with funds pursuant to the loan agreement;

(B) the lender certifies to the Board before an advance is made that, as of the date of the notice provided for in subparagraph (A), the borrower is not in default under the loan agreement: Provided , That if a default has occurred the lender shall report the facts and circumstances relating thereto to the Board and the Board may expressly and in writing waive such default in any case where it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee; and

(C) the borrower provides the Board with a plan setting forth the expenditures for which the advance will be used and the period during which the expenditures will be made, and, upon the expiration of such periods, reports to the Board any instances in which amounts advanced have not been expended in accordance with the plan.
