(A) Safety vacuum release system

A safety vacuum release system which ceases operation of the pump, reverses the circulation flow, or otherwise provides a vacuum release at a suction outlet when a blockage is detected, that has been tested by an independent third party and found to conform to ASME/ANSI standard A112.19.17 or ASTM standard F2387, or any successor standard.

(B) Suction-limiting vent system

A suction-limiting vent system with a tamper-resistant atmospheric opening.

(C) Gravity drainage system

A gravity drainage system that utilizes a collector tank.

(D) Automatic pump shut-off system

An automatic pump shut-off system.

(E) Drain disablement

A device or system that disables the drain.

(F) Other systems

Any other system determined by the Commission to be equally effective as, or better than, the systems described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of this paragraph at preventing or eliminating the risk of injury or death associated with pool drainage systems.

(2) Applicable standards

Any device or system described in subparagraphs (B) through (E) of paragraph (1) shall meet the requirements of any ASME/ANSI or ASTM performance standard if there is such a standard for such a device or system, or any applicable consumer product safety standard.
