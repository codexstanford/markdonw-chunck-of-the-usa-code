(A) In general

Nothing in this chapter, nor any amendment made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, nor any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, or scientific assessment implemented pursuant to this chapter, shall affect the right of a State or a political subdivision of a State to adopt or enforce any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, scientific assessment, or any other protection for public health or the environment that

(i) is adopted or authorized under the authority of any other Federal law or adopted to satisfy or obtain authorization or approval under any other Federal law;

(ii) implements a reporting, monitoring, or other information obligation for the chemical substance not otherwise required by the Administrator under this chapter or required under any other Federal law;

(iii) is adopted pursuant to authority under a law of the State or political subdivision of the State related to water quality, air quality, or waste treatment or disposal, except to the extent that the action

(I) imposes a restriction on the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance; and

(II)

(aa) addresses the same hazards and exposures, with respect to the same conditions of use as are included in the scope of the risk evaluation published pursuant to section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title , but is inconsistent with the action of the Administrator; or

(bb) would cause a violation of the applicable action by the Administrator under section 2604 or 2605 of this title; or

(iv) subject to subparagraph (B), is identical to a requirement prescribed by the Administrator.

(B) Identical requirements

(i) In general

The penalties and other sanctions applicable under a law of a State or political subdivision of a State in the event of noncompliance with the identical requirement shall be no more stringent than the penalties and other sanctions available to the Administrator under section 2615 of this title .

(ii) Penalties

In the case of an identical requirement

(I) a State or political subdivision of a State may not assess a penalty for a specific violation for which the Administrator has assessed an adequate penalty under section 2615 of this title ; and

(II) if a State or political subdivision of a State has assessed a penalty for a specific violation, the Administrator may not assess a penalty for that violation in an amount that would cause the total of the penalties assessed for the violation by the State or political subdivision of a State and the Administrator combined to exceed the maximum amount that may be assessed for that violation by the Administrator under section 2615 of this title .

(2) Applicability to certain rules or orders

(A) Prior rules and orders

(B) Certain chemical substances and mixtures

With respect to a chemical substance or mixture for which any rule or order was promulgated or issued under section 2605 of this title prior to the effective date of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act with respect to manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture, nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the preemptive effect of this section as in effect prior to the enactment of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act of any rule or order that is promulgated or issued with respect to such chemical substance or mixture under section 2605 of this title after that effective date, unless the latter rule or order is with respect to a chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance and follows a designation of that chemical substance as a high-priority substance under section 2605(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title , the identification of that chemical substance under section 2605(b)(2)(A) of this title , or the selection of that chemical substance for risk evaluation under section 2605(b)(4)(E)(iv)(II) of this title .
