#### § 8305. Prohibition against Federal Government bailouts of swaps entities
##### (j) Prohibition on unregulated combination of swaps entities and banking

At no time following adoption of the rules in subsection (k) may a bank or bank holding company be permitted to be or become a swap entity unless it conducts its swap or security-based swap activity in compliance with such minimum standards set by its prudential regulator as are reasonably calculated to permit the swaps entity to conduct its swap or security-based swap activities in a safe and sound manner and mitigate systemic risk.
