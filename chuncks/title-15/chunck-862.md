#### § 78o–10. Registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants
##### (e) Capital and margin requirements

(1) In general

(A) Security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are banks

Each registered security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant for which there is not a prudential regulator shall meet such minimum capital requirements and minimum initial and variation margin requirements as the prudential regulator shall by rule or regulation prescribe under paragraph (2)(A).

(B) Security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are not banks

Each registered security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant for which there is not a prudential regulator shall meet such minimum capital requirements and minimum initial and variation margin requirements as the Commission shall by rule or regulation prescribe under paragraph (2)(B).

(2) Rules

(A) Security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are banks

The prudential regulators, in consultation with the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, shall adopt rules for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, with respect to their activities as a swap dealer or major swap participant, for which there is a prudential regulator imposing

(i) capital requirements; and

(ii) both initial and variation margin requirements on all security-based swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing agency.

(B) Security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are not banks

The Commission shall adopt rules for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, with respect to their activities as a swap dealer or major swap participant, for which there is not a prudential regulator imposing

(i) capital requirements; and

(ii) both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing agency.

(C) Capital

In setting capital requirements for a person that is designated as a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant for a single type or single class or category of security-based swap or activities, the prudential regulator and the Commission shall take into account the risks associated with other types of security-based swaps or classes of security-based swaps or categories of security-based swaps engaged in and the other activities conducted by that person that are not otherwise subject to regulation applicable to that person by virtue of the status of the person.

(3) Standards for capital and margin

(A) In general

To offset the greater risk to the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant and the financial system arising from the use of security-based swaps that are not cleared, the requirements imposed under paragraph (2) shall

(i) help ensure the safety and soundness of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant; and

(ii) be appropriate for the risk associated with the non-cleared security-based swaps held as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.

(B) Rule of construction

(i) In general

Nothing in this section shall limit, or be construed to limit, the authority

(I) of the Commission to set financial responsibility rules for a broker or dealer registered pursuant to section 78 o (b) of this title (except for section 78 o (b)(11) thereof) in accordance with section 78 o (c)(3) of this title; or

(II) of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to set financial responsibility rules for a futures commission merchant or introducing broker registered pursuant to section 4f(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act [ 7 U.S.C. 6f(a) ] (except for section 4f(a)(3) [ 7 U.S.C. 6f(a)(3) ] thereof) in accordance with section 4f(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act [ 7 U.S.C. 6f(b) ].

(ii) Futures commission merchants and other dealers

A futures commission merchant, introducing broker, broker, or dealer shall maintain sufficient capital to comply with the stricter of any applicable capital requirements to which such futures commission merchant, introducing broker, broker, or dealer is subject to under this chapter or the Commodity Exchange Act [ 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].

(C) Margin requirements

In prescribing margin requirements under this subsection, the prudential regulator with respect to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are depository institutions, and the Commission with respect to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are not depository institutions shall permit the use of noncash collateral, as the regulator or the Commission determines to be consistent with

(i) preserving the financial integrity of markets trading security-based swaps; and

(ii) preserving the stability of the United States financial system.

(D) Comparability of capital and margin requirements

(i) In general

The prudential regulators, the Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission shall periodically (but not less frequently than annually) consult on minimum capital requirements and minimum initial and variation margin requirements.

(ii) Comparability

The entities described in clause (i) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, establish and maintain comparable minimum capital requirements and minimum initial and variation margin requirements, including the use of noncash collateral, for

(I) security-based swap dealers; and

(II) major security-based swap participants.

(4) Applicability with respect to counterparties

The requirements of paragraphs (2)(A)(ii) and (2)(B)(ii) shall not apply to a security-based swap in which a counterparty qualifies for an exception under section 78c–3(g)(1) of this title or satisfies the criteria in section 78c–3(g)(4) of this title .
