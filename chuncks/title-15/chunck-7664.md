### CHAPTER 119— NATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVE
#### § 9451. Artificial intelligence research and education
##### (e) Education

(1) In general

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall award grants for artificial intelligence education research, development and related activities to support K-12 and postsecondary education programs and activities, including workforce training and career and technical education programs and activities, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education, and informal education programs and activities that

(A) support the development of a diverse workforce pipeline for science and technology with respect to artificial intelligence systems;

(B) increase awareness of potential ethical, social, safety, and security risks of artificial intelligence systems;

(C) promote curriculum development for teaching topics related to artificial intelligence, including in the field of technology ethics;

(D) support efforts to achieve equitable access to K-12 artificial intelligence education in diverse geographic areas and for populations historically underrepresented in science, engineering, and artificial intelligence fields; and

(E) promote the widespread understanding of artificial intelligence principles and methods to create an educated workforce and general public able to use products enabled by artificial intelligence systems and adapt to future societal and economic changes caused by artificial intelligence systems.

(2) Artificial intelligence faculty fellowships

(A) Faculty recruitment fellowships

(i) In general

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall establish a program to award grants to eligible institutions of higher education to recruit and retain tenure-track or tenured faculty in artificial intelligence and related fields.

(ii) Use of funds

An institution of higher education shall use grant funds provided under clause (i) for the purposes of

(I) recruiting new tenure-track or tenured faculty members that conduct research and teaching in artificial intelligence and related fields and research areas, including technology ethics; and

(II) paying salary and benefits for the academic year of newly recruited tenure-track or tenured faculty members for a duration of up to three years.

(iii) Eligible institutions of higher education

For purposes of this subparagraph, an eligible institution of higher education is

(I) a Historically Black College and University (within the meaning of the term “part B institution” under section 1061 of title 20 ), Tribal College or University, or other minority-serving institution, as defined in section 1067q(a) of title 20 ;

(II) an institution classified under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as a doctorate-granting university with a high level of research activity; or

(III) an institution located in a State jurisdiction eligible to participate in the National Science Foundation’s Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.

(B) Faculty technology ethics fellowships

(i) In general

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall establish a program to award fellowships to tenure-track and tenured faculty in social and behavioral sciences, ethics, law, and related fields to develop new research projects and partnerships in technology ethics.

(ii) Purposes

The purposes of such fellowships are to enable researchers in social and behavioral sciences, ethics, law, and related fields to establish new research and education partnerships with researchers in artificial intelligence and related fields; learn new techniques and acquire systematic knowledge in artificial intelligence and related fields; and mentor and advise graduate students and postdocs pursuing research in technology ethics.

(iii) Uses of funds

A fellowship may include salary and benefits for up to one academic year, expenses to support coursework or equivalent training in artificial intelligence systems, and additional such expenses that the Director deems appropriate.

(C) Omitted

(3) Update to advanced technological education program

(A) Omitted

(B) Artificial intelligence centers of excellence

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall establish national centers of scientific and technical education to advance education and workforce development in areas related to artificial intelligence pursuant to section 1862i of title 42 . Activities of such centers may include

(i) the development, dissemination, and evaluation of curriculum and other educational tools and methods in artificial intelligence related fields and research areas, including technology ethics;

(ii) the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence related certifications for 2-year programs; and

(iii) interdisciplinary science and engineering research in employment-based adult learning and career retraining related to artificial intelligence fields.
