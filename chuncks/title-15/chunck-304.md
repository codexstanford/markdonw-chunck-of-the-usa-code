#### § 69g. Condemnation and injunction proceedings
##### (b) Grounds for temporary injunction or restraining order; issuance without bond

Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that

(1) any person is volating, 1 or is about to violate, section 69a, 69d, or 69h(b) of this title; and

(2) it would be to the public interest to enjoin such violation until complaint is issued by the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [ 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] and such complaint dismissed by the Commission or set aside by the court on review, or until order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final within the meaning of said Act, the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United States or in the United States court of any Territory, for the district or Territory in which such person resides or transacts business, to enjoin such violation, and upon proper showing a temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.
