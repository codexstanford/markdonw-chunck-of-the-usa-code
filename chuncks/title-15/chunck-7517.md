(1) In general

The Secretary shall make payments, beginning not later than 45 days after March 11, 2021 , from amounts allocated under subsection (d) to eligible entities that have notified the Secretary that they request to receive payment from the Fund and that the eligible entity will use such payments in compliance with this section.

(2) If a State does not request allocated funds by the 45th day after March 11, 2021 , such State shall not be eligible for a payment from the Secretary pursuant to this section, and the Secretary shall, by the 180th day after March 11, 2021 , reallocate any funds that were not requested by such State among the States that have requested funds by the 45th day after March 11, 2021 . For any such reallocation of funds, the Secretary shall adhere to the requirements of subsection (d), except for paragraph (1), to the greatest extent possible, provided that the Secretary shall also take into consideration in determining such reallocation a State’s remaining need and a State’s record of using payments from the Fund to serve homeowners at disproportionate risk of mortgage default, foreclosure, or displacement, including homeowners having incomes equal to or less than 100 percent of the area median income for their household size or 100 percent of the median income for the United States, as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whichever is greater, and minority homeowners.
