### CHAPTER 72— SEMICONDUCTOR RESEARCH
#### § 4632. Semiconductor research and development
##### (b) Findings and purposes

(1) The Congress finds and declares that

(A) semiconductor technology is playing an ever-increasing role in United States industrial and commercial products and processes, making secure domestic sources of state-of-the-art semiconductors highly desirable;

(B) modern weapons systems are highly dependent on leading edge semiconductor devices, and it is counter to the national security interest to be heavily dependent upon foreign sources for this technology;

(C) governmental responsibilities related to the semiconductor industry are divided among many Federal departments and agencies; and

(D) joint industry-government consideration of semiconductor industry problems is needed at this time.

(2) The purposes of this section are

(A) to establish the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors; and

(B) to assign to such Committee the responsibility for devising and promulgating a national semiconductor strategy, including research and development, the implementation of which will assure the continued leadership of the United States in semiconductor technology.
