### CHAPTER 92— YEAR 2000 COMPUTER DATE CHANGE
#### § 6612. State of mind; bystander liability; control
##### (c) Control not determinative of liability

The fact that a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or otherwise within the control of the party against whom a claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a failure is governed by the terms of the contract.
