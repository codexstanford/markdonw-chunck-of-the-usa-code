##### (e) Regenerative braking systems

The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study to determine the overall effectiveness and feasibility of including regenerative braking systems on electric and other automobiles in order to recover energy. In such study the Secretary of Energy shall

(1) review the history of regenerative braking devices;

(2) describe relevant experimental test data and theoretical calculations with respect to such devices;

(3) assess the net energy impacts and cost effectiveness of such devices;

(4) examine present patents and patent policy regarding such devices; and

(5) determine whether regenerative braking should be used on some of the advanced electric or hybrid vehicles to be purchased or leased pursuant to section 2506(c)(2) of this title . The Secretary of Energy shall submit a report to the Congress on the findings and conclusions of such study within 1 year after September 17, 1976 .
