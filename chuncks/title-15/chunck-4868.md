#### § 2509. Loan guarantees
##### (d) Terms and conditions of guarantee

Loan guarantees under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Energy determines, except that a guarantee shall be made under this section only if

(1) the loan bears interest at a rate not to exceed such annual percent on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary of Energy determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private sector for similar loans and risks by the United States;

(2) the terms of such loan require full repayment over a period not to exceed 15 years;

(3) in the judgment of the Secretary of Energy, the amount of the loan (when combined with amounts available to the qualified borrower from other sources) will be sufficient to carry out the activity with respect to which the loan is made;

(4) in the judgment of the Secretary of Energy, there is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan by the qualified borrower; and

(5) no loan shall be guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy under subsection (b) unless the Secretary of Energy finds that no other reasonable means of financing or refinancing is reasonably available to the applicant.
