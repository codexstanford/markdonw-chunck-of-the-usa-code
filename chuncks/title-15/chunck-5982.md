##### (h) International regional environmental initiatives

(1) Establishment of initiatives

The TPCC may establish one or more international regional environmental initiatives the purpose of which shall be to coordinate the activities of Federal departments and agencies in order to build environmental partnerships between the United States and the geographic region outside the United States for which such initiative is established. Such partnerships shall enhance environmental protection and promote sustainable development by using in the region technical expertise and financial resources of United States departments and agencies that provide foreign assistance and by expanding United States exports of environmental technologies, goods, and services to that region.

(2) Activities

In carrying out each international regional environmental initiative, the TPCC shall

(A) support, through the provision of foreign assistance, the development of sound environmental policies and practices in countries in the geographic region for which the initiative is established, including the development of environmentally sound regulatory regimes and enforcement mechanisms;

(B) identify and disseminate to United States environmental businesses information regarding specific environmental business opportunities in that geographic region;

(C) coordinate existing Federal efforts to promote environmental exports to that geographic region, and ensure that such efforts are fully coordinated with environmental export promotion efforts undertaken by the States and the private sector;

(D) increase assistance provided by the Federal Government to promote exports from the United States of environmental technologies, goods, and services to that geographic region, such as trade missions, reverse trade missions, trade fairs, and programs in the United States to train foreign nationals in United States environmental technologies; and

(E) increase high-level advocacy by United States Government officials (including the United States ambassadors to the countries in that geographic region) for United States environmental businesses seeking market opportunities in that geographic region.
