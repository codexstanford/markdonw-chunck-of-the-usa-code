#### § 647. Duplication of activities of other Federal departments or agencies
##### (a) General prohibition; exception

The Administration shall not duplicate the work or activity of any other department or agency of the Federal Government,, 1 and nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize any such duplication unless such work or activity is expressly provided for in this chapter. If loan applications are being refused or loans denied by such other department or agency responsible for such work or activity due to administrative withholding from obligation or withholding from apportionment, or due to administratively declared moratorium, then, for purposes of this section, no duplication shall be deemed to have occurred.
