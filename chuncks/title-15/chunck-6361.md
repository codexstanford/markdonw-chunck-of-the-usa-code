#### § 6603. Application of chapter
##### (d) Warranty and contract preservation

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K action any written contractual term, including a limitation or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, 1999 , specifically addressing that term.

(2) Interpretation of contract

In any Y2K action in which a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at the time the contract was executed.

(3) Unconscionability

Nothing in paragraph (1) shall prevent enforcement of State law doctrines of unconscionability, including adhesion, recognized as of January 1, 1999 , in controlling judicial precedent by the courts of the State whose law applies to the Y2K action.
