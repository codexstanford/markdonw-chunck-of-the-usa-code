#### § 278h–1. Standards for artificial intelligence
##### (b) Supporting activities

The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology may

(1) support measurement research and development of best practices and voluntary standards for trustworthy artificial intelligence systems, which may include

(A) privacy and security, including for datasets used to train or test artificial intelligence systems and software and hardware used in artificial intelligence systems;

(B) advanced computer chips and hardware designed for artificial intelligence systems;

(C) data management and techniques to increase the usability of data, including strategies to systematically clean, label, and standardize data into forms useful for training artificial intelligence systems and the use of common, open licenses;

(D) safety and robustness of artificial intelligence systems, including assurance, verification, validation, security, control, and the ability for artificial intelligence systems to withstand unexpected inputs and adversarial attacks;

(E) auditing mechanisms and benchmarks for accuracy, transparency, verifiability, and safety assurance for artificial intelligence systems;

(F) applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems to improve other scientific fields and engineering;

(G) model documentation, including performance metrics and constraints, measures of fairness, training and testing processes, and results;

(H) system documentation, including connections and dependences within and between systems, and complications that may arise from such connections; and

(I) all other areas deemed by the Director to be critical to the development and deployment of trustworthy artificial intelligence;

(2) produce curated, standardized, representative, high-value, secure, aggregate, and privacy protected data sets for artificial intelligence research, development, and use;

(3) support one or more institutes as described in section 9431(b) of this title for the purpose of advancing measurement science, voluntary consensus standards, and guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence systems;

(4) support and strategically engage in the development of voluntary consensus standards, including international standards, through open, transparent, and consensus-based processes; and

(5) enter into and perform such contracts, including cooperative research and development arrangements and grants and cooperative agreements or other transactions, as may be necessary in the conduct of the work of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and on such terms as the Director considers appropriate, in furtherance of the purposes of this division. 1
