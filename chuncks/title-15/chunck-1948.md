(2) All repayments of loans and debentures, payments of interest and other receipts arising out of transactions heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Administration (A) pursuant to sections 634(e), 636(b)(1), 636(b)(2), 636(b)(3), 636(b)(4), 636(b)(5), 636(b)(6), 636(b)(7), 636(b)(8), 636(d)(2), and 636(g) of this title, shall be paid into a disaster loan fund; and (B) pursuant to sections 634(g), 636(a), 636(h), 636(i), 636( l ), 1 636(m), and 637(a) of this title, and titles III, IV and V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [ 15 U.S.C. 681 et seq., 692 et seq., 695 et seq.], shall be paid into the business loan and investment fund.

(3) Unexpended balances of appropriations made to the fund pursuant to this subsection, as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this paragraph, shall be allocated, together with related assets and liabilities, to the funds established by paragraph (1) in such amounts as the Administrator shall determine.

(4) The Administration shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations, Senate Select Committee on Small Business, and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, as soon as possible after the beginning of each calendar quarter, a full and complete report on the status of each of the funds established by paragraph (1). Business-type budgets for each of the funds established by paragraph (1) shall be prepared, transmitted to the Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Select Committee on Small Business, and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, and considered, and enacted in the manner prescribed by law (sections 9103 and 9104 of title 31) for wholly owned Government corporations.

(5)

(A) The Administration is authorized to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under the revolving funds created by paragraph (1) and for authorized expenditures out of the funds. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Administration with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Administration under this paragraph. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Administration issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Administration. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. All borrowing authority contained herein shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

(B)

(i) Moneys in the funds established in paragraph (1) not needed for current operations may be paid into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.

(ii) Following the close of each fiscal year, the Administration shall pay into the miscellaneous receipts of the United States Treasury the actual interest that the Administration collects during that fiscal year on all financings made under this chapter.

(C) Except on those loan disbursements on which interest is paid under paragraph (5)(B)(ii), the Administration shall pay into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury, following the close of each fiscal year, interest received by the Administration on financing functions performed under this chapter and titles III and V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [ 15 U.S.C. 681 et seq., 695 et seq.] providing the capital used to perform such functions originated from appropriated funds. Such payments shall be treated by the Department of the Treasury as interest income, not as retirement of indebtedness.

(D) There are authorized to be appropriated, in any fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary for losses and interest subsidies incurred by the funds established by paragraph (1), but not previously reimbursed.
