#### § 717y. Voluntary conversion of natural gas users to heavy fuel oil
##### (e) Definitions

For purposes of this section

(1) The term “natural gas” has the same meaning as provided by section 2(5) of the Natural Gas Act [ 15 U.S.C. 717a(5) ].

(2) The term “just compensation”, when used with respect to any contractual interests pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), means the maximum amount of, or method of determining, consideration which does not exceed the amount by which

(A) the reasonable costs (not including capital costs) incurred, during the remainder of the period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), in direct association with the use of heavy petroleum fuel oil as a fuel in the applicable facility, exceeds

(B) the price under such contract for natural gas, subject to such contract, delivered during such period. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the reasonable costs directly associated with the use of heavy petroleum fuel oil as a fuel shall include an allowance for the amortization, over the remaining useful life, of the undepreciated value of depreciable assets located on the premises containing such facility, which assets were directly associated with the use of natural gas and are not usable in connection with the use of such heavy petroleum fuel oil.

(3) The term “just compensation”, when used with respect to any intrastate pipeline which would have transported or distributed natural gas with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), means an amount equal to any loss of revenue, during the remaining period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1), to the extent such loss

(A) is directly incurred by reason of the discontinuation of the transportation or distribution of natural gas resulting from the transfer of contractual interests pursuant to the rule required under subsection (a)(1); and

(B) is not offset by

(i) a reduction in expenses associated with such discontinuation; and

(ii) revenues derived from other transportation or distribution which would not have occurred if such contractual interests had not been transferred.

(4) The term “contractual interests” means the right to receive natural gas under contract as affected by an applicable curtailment plan filed with the Commission or the appropriate State regulatory authority.

(5) The term “interstate pipeline” means any person engaged in natural gas transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [ 15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.].

(6) The term “high-priority use” means any use of natural gas (other than its use for the generation of steam for industrial purposes or electricity) identified by the Commission as a high priority use for which the Commission determines a substitute fuel is not reasonably available.

(7) The term “heavy petroleum fuel oil” means number 4, 5, or 6 fuel oil which is domestically refined.

(8) The term “local distribution company” means any person, other than any intrastate pipeline or any interstate pipeline, engaged in the transportation, or local distribution, of natural gas and the sale of natural gas for ultimate consumption.

(9) The term “intrastate pipeline” means any person engaged in natural gas transportation (not including gathering) which is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.

(10) The term “facility” means any electric powerplant, or major fuel burning installation, as such terms are defined in the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 [ 42 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.].

(11) The term “curtailment plan” means a plan (including any modification of such plan required by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 [ 15 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] ), in effect under the Natural Gas Act or State law, which provides for recognizing and implementing priorities of service during periods of curtailed deliveries by any local distribution company, intrastate pipeline, or interstate pipeline.

(12) The term “interstate commerce” has the same meaning as such term has under the Natural Gas Act.
