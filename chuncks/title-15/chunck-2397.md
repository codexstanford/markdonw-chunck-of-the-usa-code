### CHAPTER 14B— SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT PROGRAM
#### § 683. Borrowing operations
##### (b) Debentures and participating securities

To encourage the formation and growth of small business investment companies the Administration is authorized when authorized in appropriation Acts, to purchase, or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest as scheduled on, debentures or participating securities issued by such companies. Such purchases or guarantees may be made by the Administration on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, pursuant to regulations issued by the Administration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection. Debentures purchased or guaranteed by the Administration under this subsection shall be subordinate to any other debenture bonds, promissory notes, or other debts and obligations of such companies, unless the Administration in its exercise of reasonable investment prudence and in considering the financial soundness of such company determines otherwise. Such debentures may be issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years and shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such debentures, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, plus, for debentures obligated after September 30, 2001 , an additional charge, in an amount established annually by the Administration, as necessary to reduce to zero the cost (as defined in section 661a of title 2 ) to the Administration of purchasing and guaranteeing debentures under this chapter, which amount may not exceed 1.38 percent per year, and which shall be paid to and retained by the Administration. The debentures or participating securities shall also contain such other terms as the Administration may fix, and shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations:

(1) The total amount of debentures and participating securities that may be guaranteed by the Administration and outstanding from a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title shall not exceed 300 per centum of the private capital of such company: Provided , That nothing in this paragraph shall require any such company that on March 31, 1993 , has outstanding debentures in excess of 300 per centum of its private capital to prepay such excess: And provided further , That any such company may apply for an additional debenture guarantee or participating security guarantee with the proceeds to be used solely to pay the amount due on such maturing debenture, but the maturity of the new debenture or security shall be not later than September 30, 2002 .

(2) Maximum leverage.

(A) In general .

The maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to any one company licensed under section 681(c) of this title may not exceed the lesser of

(B) Multiple licenses under common control .

The maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to two or more companies licensed under section 681(c) of this title that are commonly controlled (as determined by the Administrator) and not under capital impairment may not exceed $350,000,000.

(C) Investments in low-income geographic areas .

(i) In calculating the outstanding leverage of a company for the purposes of subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall not include the amount of the cost basis of any equity investment made by the company in a smaller enterprise located in a low-income geographic area (as defined in section 689 of this title ), to the extent that the total of such amounts does not exceed 50 percent of the company’s private capital.

(ii) The maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to

(I) any 1 company described in clause (iii) may not exceed the lesser of 300 percent of private capital of the company, or $175,000,000; and

(II) 2 or more companies described in clause (iii) that are under common control (as determined by the Administrator) may not exceed $250,000,000.

(iii) A company described in this clause is a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title in the first fiscal year after February 17, 2009 , or any fiscal year thereafter that certifies in writing that not less than 50 percent of the dollar amount of investments of that company shall be made in companies that are located in a low-income geographic area (as that term is defined in section 689 of this title ).

(D) Investments in energy saving small businesses.

(i) In general .

Subject to clause (ii), in calculating the outstanding leverage of a company for purposes of subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall exclude the amount of the cost basis of any Energy Saving qualified investment in a smaller enterprise made in the first fiscal year after December 19, 2007 , or any fiscal year thereafter by a company licensed in the applicable fiscal year.

(ii) Limitations.

(I) Amount of exclusion .

The amount excluded under clause (i) for a company shall not exceed 33 percent of the private capital of that company.

(II) Maximum investment .

A company shall not make an Energy Saving qualified investment in any one entity in an amount equal to more than 20 percent of the private capital of that company.

(III) Other terms .

The exclusion of amounts under clause (i) shall be subject to such terms as the Administrator may impose to ensure that there is no cost (as that term is defined in section 661a of title 2 ) with respect to purchasing or guaranteeing any debenture involved.

(3) Subject to the foregoing dollar and percentage limits, a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title may issue and have outstanding both guaranteed debentures and participating securities: Provided , That the total amount of participating securities outstanding shall not exceed 200 per centum of private capital. For purposes of this subsection, the term “venture capital” includes such common stock, preferred stock, or other financing with subordination or nonamortization characteristics as the Administration determines to be substantially similar to equity financing.
