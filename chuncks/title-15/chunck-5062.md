#### § 2646. Contractor and laboratory accreditation
##### (c) Accreditation by Administrator-approved course

(1) Course approval

Within 180 days after October 22, 1986 , the Administrator shall ensure that any Environmental Protection Agency-approved asbestos training course is consistent with the model plan (including testing requirements) developed under subsection (b). A contractor may be accredited by taking and passing such a course.

(2) Treatment of persons with previous EPA asbestos training

A person who

(A) completed an Environmental Protection Agency-approved asbestos training course before October 22, 1986 , and

(B) passed (or passes) an asbestos test either before or after October 22, 1986 , may be accredited under paragraph (1) if the Administrator determines that the course and test are equivalent to the requirements of the model plan developed under subsection (b). If the Administrator so determines, the person shall be considered accredited for the purposes of this subchapter until a date that is one year after the date on which the State in which such person is employed establishes an accreditation program pursuant to subsection (b).

(3) Lists of courses

The Administrator, in consultation with affected organizations, shall publish (and revise as necessary)

(A) a list of asbestos courses and tests in effect before October 22, 1986 , which qualify for equivalency treatment under paragraph (2), and

(B) a list of asbestos courses and tests which the Administrator determines under paragraph (1) are consistent with the model plan and which will qualify a contractor for accreditation under such paragraph.
