### CHAPTER 53— TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL
#### § 2603. Testing of chemical substances and mixtures
##### (h) Reduction of testing on vertebrates

(1) In general

The Administrator shall reduce and replace, to the extent practicable, scientifically justified, and consistent with the policies of this subchapter, the use of vertebrate animals in the testing of chemical substances or mixtures under this subchapter by

(A) prior to making a request or adopting a requirement for testing using vertebrate animals, and in accordance with subsection (a)(3), taking into consideration, as appropriate and to the extent practicable and scientifically justified, reasonably available existing information, including

(i) toxicity information;

(ii) computational toxicology and bioinformatics; and

(iii) high-throughput screening methods and the prediction models of those methods; and

(B) encouraging and facilitating

(i) the use of scientifically valid test methods and strategies that reduce or replace the use of vertebrate animals while providing information of equivalent or better scientific quality and relevance that will support regulatory decisions under this subchapter;

(ii) the grouping of 2 or more chemical substances into scientifically appropriate categories in cases in which testing of a chemical substance would provide scientifically valid and useful information on other chemical substances in the category; and

(iii) the formation of industry consortia to jointly conduct testing to avoid unnecessary duplication of tests, provided that such consortia make all information from such testing available to the Administrator.

(2) Implementation of alternative testing methods

To promote the development and timely incorporation of new scientifically valid test methods and strategies that are not based on vertebrate animals, the Administrator shall

(A) not later than 2 years after June 22, 2016 , develop a strategic plan to promote the development and implementation of alternative test methods and strategies to reduce, refine, or replace vertebrate animal testing and provide information of equivalent or better scientific quality and relevance for assessing risks of injury to health or the environment of chemical substances or mixtures through, for example

(i) computational toxicology and bioinformatics;

(ii) high-throughput screening methods;

(iii) testing of categories of chemical substances;

(iv) tiered testing methods;

(v) in vitro studies;

(vi) systems biology;

(vii) new or revised methods identified by validation bodies such as the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods or the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; or

(viii) industry consortia that develop information submitted under this subchapter;

(B) as practicable, ensure that the strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A) is reflected in the development of requirements for testing under this section;

(C) include in the strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A) a list, which the Administrator shall update on a regular basis, of particular alternative test methods or strategies the Administrator has identified that do not require new vertebrate animal testing and are scientifically reliable, relevant, and capable of providing information of equivalent or better scientific reliability and quality to that which would be obtained from vertebrate animal testing;

(D) provide an opportunity for public notice and comment on the contents of the plan developed under subparagraph (A), including the criteria for considering scientific reliability and relevance of the test methods and strategies that may be identified pursuant to subparagraph (C);

(E) beginning on the date that is 5 years after June 22, 2016 , and every 5 years thereafter, submit to Congress a report that describes the progress made in implementing the plan developed under subparagraph (A) and goals for future alternative test methods and strategies implementation; and

(F) prioritize and, to the extent consistent with available resources and the Administrator’s other responsibilities under this subchapter, carry out performance assessment, validation, and translational studies to accelerate the development of scientifically valid test methods and strategies that reduce, refine, or replace the use of vertebrate animals, including minimizing duplication, in any testing under this subchapter.

(3) Voluntary testing

(A) In general

Any person developing information for submission under this subchapter on a voluntary basis and not pursuant to any request or requirement by the Administrator shall first attempt to develop the information by means of an alternative test method or strategy identified by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (2)(C), if the Administrator has identified such a test method or strategy for the development of such information, before conducting new vertebrate animal testing.

(B) Effect of paragraph

Nothing in this paragraph shall, under any circumstance, limit or restrict the submission of any existing information to the Administrator.

(C) Relationship to other law

A violation of this paragraph shall not be a prohibited act under section 2614 of this title .

(D) Review of means

This paragraph authorizes, but does not require, the Administrator to review the means by which a person conducted testing described in subparagraph (A).
