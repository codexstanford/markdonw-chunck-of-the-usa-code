### CHAPTER 64— METHANE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION
#### § 3801. Congressional statement of findings and declaration of policy
###### (b) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter to

(1) provide for and support advanced and accelerated research into, and development of, methane vehicle design, and related technologies;

(2) demonstrate the economic and technological practicalities of methane-fueled vehicles for fleet use and of methane-fueled farm equipment;

(3) facilitate, and remove barriers to, the use of methane-fueled vehicles in lieu of gasoline- or diesel-powered motor vehicles where practicable;

(4) promote the substitution of methane-fueled vehicles for gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles currently used on farms and in fleet operations, particularly in areas where such substitution would facilitate plans to meet air quality standards set under the Clean Air Act, as amended [ 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.]; and

(5) supplement, but neither supplant nor duplicate, the automotive propulsion system research and development efforts of private industry.
