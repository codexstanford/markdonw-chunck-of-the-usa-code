(1) In general

Subject to the requirements of subsection (a) and this subsection, the Secretary may make or guarantee loans to covered entities as financial assistance under this section.

(2) Conditions

The Secretary may select eligible projects to receive loans or loan guarantees under this subsection if the Secretary determines that

(ii) has met such other criteria as may be established and published by the Secretary; and

(B) the amount of the loan (when combined with amounts available to the loan recipient from other sources) will be sufficient to carry out the project.

(3) Reasonable prospect of repayment

The Secretary shall base a determination of whether there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the principal and interest on a loan under paragraph (2)(A)(i) on a comprehensive evaluation of whether the covered entity has a reasonable prospect of repaying the principal and interest, including, as applicable, an evaluation of

(A) the strength of the contractual terms of the project the covered entity plans to perform (if commercially reasonably available);

(B) the forecast of noncontractual cash flows supported by market projections from reputable sources, as determined by the Secretary;

(F) other financial metrics and analyses that the private lending community and nationally recognized credit rating agencies rely on, as determined appropriate by the Secretary; and

(G) such other criteria the Secretary may determine relevant.

(4) Rates, terms, and repayments of loans

A loan provided under this subsection

(A) shall have an interest rate that does not exceed a level that the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into account, as of the date on which the loan is made, the cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity; and

(B) shall have a term of not more than 25 years.

(5) Additional terms

A loan or guarantee provided under this subsection may include any other terms and conditions that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(B) adequate provision is made for servicing the loan on reasonable terms and protecting the financial interest of the United States.

(7) Advanced budget authority

New loans may not be obligated and new loan guarantees may not be committed to under this subsection, unless appropriations of budget authority to cover the costs of such loans and loan guarantees are made in advance in accordance with section 661c(b) of title 2 .

(8) Continued oversight

The loan agreement for a loan guaranteed under this subsection shall provide that no provision of the loan agreement may be amended of waived without the consent of the Secretary.
