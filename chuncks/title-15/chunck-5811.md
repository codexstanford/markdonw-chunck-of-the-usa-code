#### § 4402. Smokeless tobacco warning
##### (d) Authority to revise warning label statements

The Secretary may, by a rulemaking conducted under section 553 of title 5 , adjust the format, type size, and text of any of the label requirements, require color graphics to accompany the text, increase the required label area from 30 percent up to 50 percent of the front and rear panels of the package, or establish the format, type size, and text of any other disclosures required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, if the Secretary finds that such a change would promote greater public understanding of the risks associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products.
