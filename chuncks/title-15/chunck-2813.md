##### (d) Rules under rulemaking powers of Congress; change of rules; “resolution” defined; referral to Congressional committees; debate limitation; motion for consideration of resolution; debate on resolution; nondebatable motions and appeals from procedural decisions

(1) This subsection is enacted by Congress

(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of each House of Congress, respectively, and as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions described by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith; and

(B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as those rules relate to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of such House.

(2) For purposes of this chapter, the term “resolution” means (A) a joint resolution, the resolving clause of which is as follows: “That the House of Representatives and Senate approve the Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system submitted to the Congress on _____, 19  , and find that any environmental impact statements prepared relative to such system and submitted with the President’s decision are in compliance with the Natural  1 Environmental Policy Act of 1969.”; the blank space therein shall be filled with the date on which the President submits his decision to the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (B) a joint resolution described in subsection (g).

(3) A resolution once introduced with respect to a Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system shall be referred to one or more committees (and all resolutions with respect to the same Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system shall be referred to the same committee or committees) by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case may be.

(4)

(A) If any committee to which a resolution with respect to a Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system has been referred has not reported it at the end of 30 calendar days after its referral, it shall be in order to move either to discharge such committee from further consideration of such resolution or to discharge such committee from consideration of any other resolution with respect to such Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system which has been referred to such committee.

(B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution, shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion was agreed to or disagreed to.

(C) If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be made with respect to any other resolution with respect to the same Presidential decision on an Alaska natural gas transportation system.

(5)

(A) When any committee has reported, or has been discharged from further consideration of, a resolution, but in no case earlier than 30 days after the date of receipt of the President’s decision to the Congress, it shall be at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion shall be highly privileged and shall not be debatable. An amendment to the motion shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion was agreed to or disagreed to.

(B) Debate on the resolution described in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection shall be limited to not more than 10 hours and on any resolution described in subsection (g) to one hour. This time shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing such resolution. A motion further to limit debate shall not be debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit the resolution shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which such resolution was agreed to or disagreed to or, thereafter within such 60-day period, to consider any other resolution respecting the same Presidential decision.

(6)

(A) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee, or the consideration of a resolution and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business, shall be decided without debate.

(B) Appeals from the decision of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedures relating to a resolution shall be decided without debate.
