### CHAPTER 60— NATURAL GAS POLICY
#### § 3363. Emergency allocation authority
##### (d) Allocation of user-owned gas

(1) Required finding

The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that

(A) to the maximum extent practicable, allocation of supplies of natural gas under subsection (c) has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;

(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;

(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;

(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries; and

(E) such allocation will not create, for the person who owns and would otherwise use such natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such person to be unable to satisfy such person’s natural gas requirements for high-priority uses.

(2) Allocation authority

Subject to paragraphs (1) and (3), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas which would be certificated natural gas but for the second sentence of section 3301(19) of this title .

(3) Consideration of economic feasibility of alternative fuels

In issuing any order under this subsection, the President shall consider the economic feasibility of alternative fuels available to the user which owned the natural gas subject to an order under this subsection.
