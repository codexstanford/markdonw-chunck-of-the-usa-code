(i) proof of concept research or prototype development; and

(ii) activities that contribute to determining a project’s commercialization path, to include technical validations, market research, clarifying intellectual property rights, and investigating commercial and business opportunities; or

(B) to fund the acquisition of research equipment or supplies unrelated to commercialization activities.

(6) Evaluative report

The Director shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate an evaluative report regarding the activities of the pilot program.
