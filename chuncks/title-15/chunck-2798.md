#### § 719c. Federal Power Commission reviews and reports
##### (c) Report; public availability; factors to be discussed

The Commission shall accompany any recommendation under subsection (b)(1) with a report, which shall be available to the public, explaining the basis for such recommendation and including for each transportation system reviewed or considered a discussion of the following:

(1) for each year of the 20-year period which begins with the first year following October 22, 1976 , the estimated

(A) volumes of Alaska natural gas which would be available to each region of the United States directly, or indirectly by displacement or otherwise, and

(B) transportation costs and delivered prices of any such volumes of gas by region;

(2) the effects of each of the factors described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) on the projected natural gas supply and demand for each region of the United States and on the projected supplies of alternative fuels available by region to offset shortages of natural gas occurring in such region for each such year;

(3) the impact upon competition;

(4) the extent to which the system provides a means for the transportation to United States markets of natural resources or other commodities from sources in addition to the Prudhoe Bay Reserve;

(5) environmental impacts;

(6) safety and efficiency in design and operation and potential for interruption in deliveries of Alaska natural gas;

(7) construction schedules and possibilities for delay in such schedules or for delay occurring as a result of other factors;

(8) feasibility of financing;

(9) extent of reserves, both proven and probable and their deliverability by year for each year of the 20-year period which begins with the first year following October 22, 1976 ;

(10) the estimate of the total delivered cost to users of the natural gas to be transported by the system by year for each year of the 20-year period which begins with the first year following October 22, 1976 ;

(11) capability and cost of expanding the system to transport additional volumes of natural gas in excess of initial system capacity;

(12) an estimate of the capital and operating costs, including an analysis of the reliability of such estimates and the risk of cost overruns; and

(13) such other factors as the Commission determines to be appropriate.
