### CHAPTER 47— CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
#### § 2056b. Mandatory toy safety standards
##### (h) Rulemaking to consider exemption from preemption

(1) Exemption of State law from preemption

Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, consider a rulemaking to exempt from the provisions of section 2075(a) of this title (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a children’s product subject to the consumer product safety standards described in subsection (a) or any rule promulgated under this section. The Commission shall grant such an exemption if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation

(A) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard or rule under this section; and

(B) does not unduly burden interstate commerce. In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this Act for such consumer product.

(2) Effect of standards on established State laws

Nothing in this section or in section 2075 of this title shall prevent a State or political subdivision of a State from continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a toy or other children’s product that is designed to deal with the same risk of injury as the consumer product safety standards established by this section and that is in effect on the day before August 14, 2008 , if such State or political subdivision has filed such requirement with the Commission within 90 days after August 14, 2008 , in such form and in such manner as the Commission may require.
