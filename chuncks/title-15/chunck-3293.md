Not less than thirty days before any person exports to a foreign country any fabric, related material, or product that fails to conform to an applicable flammability standard or regulation in effect under this chapter, such person shall file a statement with the Commission notifying the Commission of such exportation, and the Commission, upon receipt of such statement, shall promptly notify the government of such country of such exportation and of the basis for such flammability standard or regulation. Any statement filed with the Commission under the preceding sentence shall specify the anticipated date of shipment of such fabric, related material, or product, the country and port of destination of such fabric, related material, or product, and the quantity of such fabric, related material, or product that will be exported, and shall contain such other information as the Commission may by regulation require.
