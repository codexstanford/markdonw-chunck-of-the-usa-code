### CHAPTER 2B— SECURITIES EXCHANGES
#### § 78c–3. Clearing for security-based swaps
##### (a) In general

(1) Standard for clearing

It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in a security-based swap unless that person submits such security-based swap for clearing to a clearing agency that is registered under this chapter or a clearing agency that is exempt from registration under this chapter if the security-based swap is required to be cleared.

(2) Open access

The rules of a clearing agency described in paragraph (1) shall

(A) prescribe that all security-based swaps submitted to the clearing agency with the same terms and conditions are economically equivalent within the clearing agency and may be offset with each other within the clearing agency; and

(B) provide for non-discriminatory clearing of a security-based swap executed bilaterally or on or through the rules of an unaffiliated national securities exchange or security-based swap execution facility.
