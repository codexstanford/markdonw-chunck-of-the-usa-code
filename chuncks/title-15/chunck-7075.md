##### (b) Reports

Not later than 1 year after January 7, 2019 , and triennially thereafter until the date that is 6 years after the date on which the first report is submitted, the Under Secretary, acting through the Chief Information Officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Director of the National Weather Service, shall produce and make publicly available a report that explains how the Under Secretary intends

(1) to continually support upgrades to pursue the fastest, most powerful, and cost-effective high performance computing technologies in support of its weather prediction mission;

(2) to ensure a balance between the research to operations requirements to develop the next generation of regional and global models as well as highly reliable operational models;

(3) to take advantage of advanced development concepts to, as appropriate, make next generation weather prediction models available in beta-test mode to operational forecasters, the United States weather industry, and partners in academic and Government research;

(4) to use existing computing resources to improve advanced research and operational weather prediction;

(5) to utilize non-Federal contracts to obtain the necessary expertise for advanced weather computing, if appropriate;

(6) to utilize cloud computing; and

(7) to create a long-term strategy to transition the programming language of weather model code to current and broadly-used coding language.
