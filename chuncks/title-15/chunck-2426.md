### CHAPTER 14B— SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT PROGRAM
#### § 687. Operation and regulation of companies
##### (i) Interest rates

(1) The purpose of this subsection is to facilitate the orderly and necessary flow of long-term loans and equity funds from small business investment companies to small business concerns.

(2) In the case of a business loan, the small business investment company making such loan may charge interest on such loan at a rate which does not exceed the maximum rate prescribed by regulation by the Administration for loans made by any licensee (determined without regard to any State rate incorporated by such regulation). In this paragraph, the term “interest” includes only the maximum mandatory sum, expressed in dollars or as a percentage rate, that is payable with respect to the business loan amount received by the small business concern, and does not include the value, if any, of contingent obligations, including warrants, royalty, or conversion rights, granting the small business investment company an ownership interest in the equity or increased future revenue of the small business concern receiving the business loan.

(3) A State law or constitutional provision shall be preempted for purposes of paragraph (2) with respect to any loan if such loan is made before the date, on or after April 1, 1980 , on which such State adopts a law or certifies that the voters of such State have voted in favor of any provision, constitutional or otherwise, which states explicitly and by its terms that such State does not want the provisions of this subsection to apply with respect to loans made in such State, except that such State law or constitutional or other provision shall be preempted in the case of a loan made, on or after the date on which such law is adopted or such certification is made, pursuant to a commitment to make such loan which was entered into on or after April 1, 1980 , and prior to the date on which such law is adopted or such certification is made.

(4)

(A) If the maximum rate of interest authorized under paragraph (2) on any loan made by a small business investment company exceeds the rate which would be authorized by applicable State law if such State law were not preempted for purposes of this subsection, the charging of interest at any rate in excess of the rate authorized by paragraph (2) shall be deemed a forfeiture of the greater of (i) all interest which the loan carries with it, or (ii) all interest which has been agreed to be paid thereon.

(B) In the case of any loan with respect to which there is a forfeiture of interest under subparagraph (A), the person who paid the interest may recover from a small business investment company making such loan an amount equal to twice the amount of the interest paid on such loan. Such interest may be recovered in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the most recent payment of interest.
