#### § 636. Additional powers
##### (i) Loans to small business concerns located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals, or owned by low-income individuals

(1) The Administration also is empowered to make, participate (on an immediate basis) in, or guarantee loans, repayable in not more than fifteen years, to any small business concern, or to any qualified person seeking to establish such a concern, when it determines that such loans will further the policies established in section 631(b)  2 of this title, with particular emphasis on the preservation or establishment of small business concerns located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals, or owned by low-income individuals: Provided, however , That no such loans shall be made, participated in, or guaranteed if the total of such Federal assistance to a single borrower outstanding at any one time would exceed $100,000. The Administration may defer payments on the principal of such loans for a grace period and use such other methods as it deems necessary and appropriate to assure the successful establishment and operation of such concern. The Administration may, in its discretion, as a condition of such financial assistance, require that the borrower take steps to improve his management skills by participating in a management training program approved by the Administration: Provided, however , That any management training program so approved must be of sufficient scope and duration to provide reasonable opportunity for the individuals served to develop entrepreneurial and managerial self-sufficiency.

(2) The Administration shall encourage, as far as possible, the participation of the private business community in the program of assistance to such concerns, and shall seek to stimulate new private lending activities to such concerns through the use of the loan guarantees, participations in loans, and pooling arrangements authorized by this subsection.

(3) To insure an equitable distribution between urban and rural areas for loans between $3,500 and $100,000 made under this subsection, the Administration is authorized to use the agencies and agreements and delegations developed under title III of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended [ 42 U.S.C. 2841 et seq.], as it shall determine necessary.

(4) The Administration shall provide for the continuing evaluation of programs under this subsection, including full information on the location, income characteristics, and types of businesses and individuals assisted, and on new private lending activity stimulated, and the results of such evaluation together with recommendations shall be included in the report required by section 639(a) of this title .

(5) Loans made pursuant to this subsection (including immediate participation in and guarantees of such loans) shall have such terms and conditions as the Administration shall determine, subject to the following limitations

(A) there is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan;

(B) the financial assistance is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from private sources or other Federal, State, or local programs;

(C) the amount of the loan, together with other funds available, is adequate to assure completion of the project or achievement of the purposes for which the loan is made;

(D) the loan bears interest at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding Treasury obligations of comparable maturity, plus (ii) such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Administration may determine to be consistent with its purposes: Provided, however , That the rate of interest charged on loans made in redevelopment areas designated under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 [ 42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq.] shall not exceed the rate currently applicable to new loans made under section 201 of that Act [ 42 U.S.C. 3141 ]; and

(E) fees not in excess of amounts necessary to cover administrative expenses and probable losses may be required on loan guarantees.

(6) The Administration shall take such steps as may be necessary to insure that, in any fiscal year, at least 50 per centum of the amounts loaned or guaranteed pursuant to this subsection are allotted to small business concerns located in urban areas identified by the Administration as having high concentrations of unemployed or low-income individuals or to small business concerns owned by low-income individuals. The Administration shall define the meaning of low income as it applies to owners of small business concerns eligible to be assisted under this subsection.

(7) No financial assistance shall be extended pursuant to this subsection where the Administration determines that the assistance will be used in relocating establishments from one area to another if such relocation would result in an increase in unemployment in the area of original location.
