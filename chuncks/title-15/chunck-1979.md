(2) During any period in which principal and interest charges are suspended on the Federal share of any loan, as provided in subsection (b), the Administrator shall, upon the request of any person, firm, or corporation having a participation in such loan, purchase such participation, or assume the obligation of the borrower, for the balance of such period, to make principal and interest payments on the non-Federal share of such loan: Provided , That no such payments shall be made by the Administrator in behalf of any borrower unless (i) the Administrator determines that such action is necessary in order to avoid a default, and (ii) the borrower agrees to make payments to the Administration in an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid in its behalf by the Administrator, in such manner and at such times (during or after the term of the loan) as the Administrator shall determine having due regard to the purposes sought to be achieved by this paragraph.
