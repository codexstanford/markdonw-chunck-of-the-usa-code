(A) a uniform method by which a person may certify to another the automotive fuel rating of automotive fuel; and

(B) a uniform method of displaying the automotive fuel rating of automotive fuel at the point of sale to ultimate purchasers.

(2) Effective on and after the effective date of the rule prescribed under paragraph (1), any person

(A) shall be considered to satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) or (b) of section 2822 of this title , as the case may be, only if such person complies with the requirements established pursuant to paragraph (1)(A); and

(B) shall be considered to satisfy the requirements of section 2822(c) of this title only if such person complies with the requirements established pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).

(3) The Federal Trade Commission may, by rule, prescribe procedures for determination of the automotive fuel rating of automotive fuel which varies from that prescribed in section 2821 of this title . In prescribing such rule, the Commission

(A) shall consider

(i) ease of administration and enforcement, and

(ii) industry practices in the distribution and marketing of automotive fuel; and

(B) may permit adjustments in such automotive fuel rating to take into account the effects of altitude, temperature, and humidity.

(4) The Federal Trade Commission may, by rule, prescribe and make effective a method of determining the automotive fuel rating of automotive fuel which consists of a blend of two or more quantities of automotive fuel of different automotive fuel ratings if the Federal Trade Commission finds that the method prescribed more accurately reflects the automotive fuel rating of such blend than the weighted-average method set forth in section 2822(f)(1) of this title . Effective on and after the effective date of such rule, any person shall be considered to satisfy the requirements of section 2822(f)(1) of this title only if such person utilizes the method prescribed in such rule (in lieu of the method set forth in section 2822(f)(1) of this title ).
