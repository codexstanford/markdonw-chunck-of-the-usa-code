(2) to make a complete inventory of all productive facilities of small-business concerns or to arrange for such inventory to be made by any other governmental agency which has the facilities. In making any such inventory, the appropriate agencies in the several States may be requested to furnish an inventory of the productive facilities of small-business concerns in each respective State if such an inventory is available or in prospect;

(3) to coordinate and to ascertain the means by which the productive capacity of small-business concerns can be most effectively utilized;

(4) to consult and cooperate with officers of the Government having procurement or property disposal powers, in order to utilize the potential productive capacity of plants operated by small-business concerns;

(5) to obtain information as to methods and practices which Government prime contractors utilize in letting subcontracts and to take action to encourage the letting of subcontracts by prime contractors to small-business concerns at prices and on conditions and terms which are fair and equitable;

(6) to determine within any industry the concerns, firms, persons, corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, or other business enterprises which are to be designated “small-business concerns” for the purpose of effectuating the provisions of this chapter. To carry out this purpose the Administrator, when requested to do so, shall issue in response to each such request an appropriate certificate certifying an individual concern as a “small-business concern” in accordance with the criteria expressed in this chapter. Any such certificate shall be subject to revocation when the concern covered thereby ceases to be a “small-business concern”. Offices of the Government having procurement or lending powers, or engaging in the disposal of Federal property or allocating materials or supplies, or promulgating regulations affecting the distribution of materials or supplies, shall accept as conclusive the Administration’s determination as to which enterprises are to be designated “small-business concerns”, as authorized and directed under this paragraph;

(7)

(A) To certify to Government procurement officers, and officers engaged in the sale and disposal of Federal property, with respect to all elements of responsibility, including, but not limited to, capability, competency, capacity, credit, integrity, perseverance, and tenacity, of any small business concern or group of such concerns to receive and perform a specific Government contract. A Government procurement officer or an officer engaged in the sale and disposal of Federal property may not, for any reason specified in the preceding sentence preclude any small business concern or group of such concerns from being awarded such contract without referring the matter for a final disposition to the Administration.

(B) If a Government procurement officer finds that an otherwise qualified small business concern may be ineligible due to the provisions of section 35(a)  1 of title 41, he shall notify the Administration in writing of such finding. The Administration shall review such finding and shall either dismiss it and certify the small business concern to be an eligible Government contractor for a specific Government contract or if it concurs in the finding, forward the matter to the Secretary of Labor for final disposition, in which case the Administration may certify the small business concern only if the Secretary of Labor finds the small business concern not to be in violation.

(C) In any case in which a small business concern or group of such concerns has been certified by the Administration pursuant to (A) or (B) to be a responsible or eligible Government contractor as to a specific Government contract, the officers of the Government having procurement or property disposal powers are directed to accept such certification as conclusive, and shall let such Government contract to such concern or group of concerns without requiring it to meet any other requirement of responsibility or eligibility. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, the Administration may not establish an exemption from referral or notification or refuse to accept a referral or notification from a Government procurement officer made pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, but nothing in this paragraph shall require the processing of an application for certification if the small business concern to which the referral pertains declines to have the application processed.

(8) to obtain from any Federal department, establishment, or agency engaged in procurement or in the financing of procurement or production such reports concerning the letting of contracts and subcontracts and the making of loans to business concerns as it may deem pertinent in carrying out its functions under this chapter;

(9) to obtain from any Federal department, establishment, or agency engaged in the disposal of Federal property such reports concerning the solicitation of bids, time of sale, or otherwise as it may deem pertinent in carrying out its functions under this chapter;

(12) to consult and cooperate with all Government agencies for the purpose of insuring that small-business concerns shall receive fair and reasonable treatment from such agencies;

(13) to establish such advisory boards and committees as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter and of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [ 15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]; to call meetings of such boards and committees from time to time; to pay the transportation expenses and a per diem allowance in accordance with section 5703 of title 5 to the members of such boards and committees for travel and subsistence expenses incurred at the request of the Administration in connection with travel to points more than fifty miles distant from the homes of such members in attending the meeting of such boards and committees; and to rent temporarily, within the District of Columbia or elsewhere, such hotel or other accommodations as are needed to facilitate the conduct of such meetings;

(14) to provide at the earliest practicable time such information and assistance as may be appropriate, including information concerning eligibility for loans under section 636(b)(3) of this title , to local public agencies (as defined in section 110(h) of the Housing Act of 1949 [ 42 U.S.C. 1460(h) ]) and to small-business concerns to be displaced by federally aided urban renewal projects in order to assist such small-business concerns in reestablishing their operations;

(15) to disseminate, without regard to the provisions of section 3204 of title 39 data and information, in such form as it shall deem appropriate, to public agencies, private organizations, and the general public;

(16) to make studies of matters materially affecting the competitive strength of small business, and of the effect on small business of Federal laws, programs, and regulations, and to make recommendations to the appropriate Federal agency or agencies for the adjustment of such programs and regulations to the needs of small business; and

(17) to make grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, educational institutions, private businesses, veterans’ nonprofit community-based organizations, and Federal, State, and local departments and agencies for the establishment and implementation of outreach programs for disabled veterans (as defined in section 4211(3) of title 38 ), veterans, and members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces.
