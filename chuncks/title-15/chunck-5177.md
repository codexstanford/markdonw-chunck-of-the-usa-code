#### § 2703. Advanced systems program implementation by Secretary of Energy
##### (a) Establishment and conduct of program

The Secretary of Energy shall establish, within the Department of Energy, a program to insure the development of advanced automobile propulsion systems within 5 years after February 25, 1978 , or within the shortest practicable time, consistent with appropriate research and development technique. In conducting such program, the Secretary of Energy shall

(1) establish and conduct new projects and accelerate existing projects which may contribute to the development of advanced automobile propulsion systems;

(2) give priority attention to the development of advanced propulsion systems with appropriate attention to those advanced propulsion systems which are flexible in the type of fuel used; and
