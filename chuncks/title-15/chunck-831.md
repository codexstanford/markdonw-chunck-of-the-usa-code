### CHAPTER 2B— SECURITIES EXCHANGES
#### § 78o–7. Registration of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
##### (c) Accountability for ratings procedures

(1) Authority

The Commission shall have exclusive authority to enforce the provisions of this section in accordance with this chapter with respect to any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if such nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues credit ratings in material contravention of those procedures relating to such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, including procedures relating to the prevention of misuse of nonpublic information and conflicts of interest, that such nationally recognized statistical rating organization

(A) includes in its application for registration under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii); or

(B) makes and disseminates in reports pursuant to section 78q(a) of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder.

(2) Limitation

The rules and regulations that the Commission may prescribe pursuant to this chapter, as they apply to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, shall be narrowly tailored to meet the requirements of this chapter applicable to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any other provision of law, neither the Commission nor any State (or political subdivision thereof) may regulate the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nationally recognized statistical rating organization determines credit ratings. Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to afford a defense against any action or proceeding brought by the Commission to enforce the antifraud provisions of the securities laws.

(3) Internal controls over processes for determining credit ratings

(A) In general

Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings, taking into consideration such factors as the Commission may prescribe, by rule.

(B) Attestation requirement

The Commission shall prescribe rules requiring each nationally recognized statistical rating organization to submit to the Commission an annual internal controls report, which shall contain

(i) a description of the responsibility of the management of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization in establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure under subparagraph (A);

(ii) an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization; and

(iii) the attestation of the chief executive officer, or equivalent individual, of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
