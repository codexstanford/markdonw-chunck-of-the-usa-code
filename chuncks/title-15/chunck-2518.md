#### § 690e. Issuance and guarantee of trust certificates
##### (b) Guarantee

(1) In general

The Administrator may, under such terms and conditions as it determines appropriate, guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administrator or its agents for purposes of this section.

(2) Limitation

Each guarantee under this subsection shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed debentures that compose the trust or pool.

(3) Prepayment or default

If a debenture in a trust or pool is prepaid, or in the event of default of such a debenture, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid debenture represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted debentures shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administrator only through the date of payment of the guarantee. At any time during its term, a trust certificate may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all debentures.
