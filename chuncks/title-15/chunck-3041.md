# Title 15— COMMERCE AND TRADE
### CHAPTER 21— NATIONAL POLICY ON EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY
#### § 1021. Congressional declarations
##### (j) Reliance on private sector

The Congress further declares that it is the purpose of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 [ 15 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.] to rely principally on the private sector for expansion of economic activity and creation of new jobs for a growing labor force. Toward this end, it is the purpose of this chapter to encourage the adoption of fiscal policies that would establish the share of the gross national product accounted for by Federal outlays at the lowest level consistent with national needs and priorities.
