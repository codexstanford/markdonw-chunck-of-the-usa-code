(1) Evaluation

Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008 , the Commission, in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, shall examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 or its successor standard (except for section 4.2 and Annex 4), as it relates to safety requirements, safety labeling requirements, and test methods related to

(B) toxic substances;

(C) toys with spherical ends;

(D) hemispheric-shaped objects;

(E) cords, straps, and elastics; and

(F) battery-operated toys.

(2) Rulemaking

Within 1 year after the completion of the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall promulgate rules in accordance with section 553 of title 5 that

(A) take into account other children’s product safety rules; and
