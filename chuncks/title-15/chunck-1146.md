(1) In general

Not later than January 1, 2011 , and every 5 years thereafter, and subject to the approval of the Commission as provided under section 78ccc(e)(2) of this title , the Board of Directors of SIPC shall determine whether an inflation adjustment to the standard maximum cash advance amount is appropriate. If the Board of Directors of SIPC determines such an adjustment is appropriate, then the standard maximum cash advance amount shall be an amount equal to

The index values used in calculations under this paragraph shall be, as of the date of the calculation, the values most recently published by the Department of Commerce.

(2) Rounding

(4) Implementation period

Any adjustment to the standard maximum cash advance amount shall take effect on January 1 of the year immediately succeeding the calendar year in which such adjustment is made.
