### CHAPTER 30— HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
#### § 1277. Labeling of art materials
##### (d) Guidelines for determining chronically hazardous art materials; issuance; public hearing; scope of criteria; review; amendment

(1) Within 1 year of November 18, 1988 , the Commission shall issue guidelines which specify criteria for determining when any customary or reasonably foreseeable use of an art material can result in a chronic hazard. In developing such guidelines the Commission shall conduct a public hearing and provide reasonable opportunity for the submission of comments.

(2) The guidelines established under paragraph (1) shall include

(A) criteria for determining when art materials may produce chronic adverse health effects in children and criteria for determining when art materials may produce such health effects in adults,

(B) criteria for determining which substances contained in art materials have the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects and what those effects are,

(C) criteria for determining the bioavailability of chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials when the products are used in a customary or reasonably foreseeable manner, and

(D) criteria for determining acceptable daily intake levels for chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials. Where appropriate, criteria used for assessing risks to children may be the same as those used for adults.

(3) The Commission shall periodically review the guidelines established under paragraph (1) to determine whether the guidelines reflect relevant changes in scientific knowledge and in the formulations of art materials, and shall amend the guidelines to reflect such changes.
