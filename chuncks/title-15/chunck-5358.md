#### § 3115. Youth employment policies and programs
##### (a) Congressional findings

The Congress finds and declares

(1) That  1 serious unemployment and economic disadvantage of a unique nature exist among youths even under generally favorable economic conditions;

(2) that this group constitutes a substantial portion of the Nation’s unemployment, and that this significantly contributes to crime, alcoholism and drug abuse, and other social and economic problems; and

(3) that many youths have special employment needs and problems which, if not promptly addressed, will substantially contribute to more severe unemployment problems in the long run.
