##### (a) Failure to pay assessment, etc.

If a member of SIPC shall fail to file any report or information required pursuant to this chapter, or shall fail to pay when due all or any part of an assessment made upon such member pursuant to this chapter, and such failure shall not have been cured, by the filing of such report or information or by the making of such payment, together with interest and penalty thereon, within five days after receipt by such member of written notice of such failure given by or on behalf of SIPC, it shall be unlawful for such member, unless specifically authorized by the Commission, to engage in business as a broker or dealer. If such member denies that it owes all or any part of the amount specified in such notice, it may after payment of the full amount so specified commence an action against SIPC in the appropriate United States district court to recover the amount it denies owing.
