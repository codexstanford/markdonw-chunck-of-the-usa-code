##### (f) Action taken to reduce unemployment

(A) take such action as practicable to achieve the objectives of this subsection;

(B) make studies, develop information, and make recommendations toward remedying these differences in rates of unemployment, and prepare and submit to the President an annual report containing the recommendations; and
