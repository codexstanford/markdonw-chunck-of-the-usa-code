### CHAPTER 41— CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION
#### § 1693c. Terms and conditions of transfers
##### (b) Notification of changes to consumer

A financial institution shall notify a consumer in writing at least twenty-one days prior to the effective date of any change in any term or condition of the consumer’s account required to be disclosed under subsection (a) if such change would result in greater cost or liability for such consumer or decreased access to the consumer’s account. A financial institution may, however, implement a change in the terms or conditions of an account without prior notice when such change is immediately necessary to maintain or restore the security of an electronic fund transfer system or a consumer’s account. Subject to subsection (a)(3), the Bureau shall require subsequent notification if such a change is made permanent.
