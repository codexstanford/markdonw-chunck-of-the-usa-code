#### § 2064. Substantial product hazards
##### (f) Hearing

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an order under subsection (c) or (d) may be issued only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 except that, if the Commission determines that any person who wishes to participate in such hearing is a part of a class of participants who share an identity of interest, the Commission may limit such person’s participation in such hearing to participation through a single representative designated by such class (or by the Commission if such class fails to designate such a representative). Any settlement offer which is submitted to the presiding officer at a hearing under this subsection shall be transmitted by the officer to the Commission for its consideration unless the settlement offer is clearly frivolous or duplicative of offers previously made.

(2) The requirement for a hearing in paragraph (1) shall not apply to an order issued under subsection (c) or (d) relating to an imminently hazardous consumer product with regard to which the Commission has filed an action under section 2061 of this title .
