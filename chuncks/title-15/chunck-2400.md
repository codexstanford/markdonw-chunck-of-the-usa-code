### CHAPTER 14B— SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT PROGRAM
#### § 683. Borrowing operations
##### (e) Capital impairment

Before approving any application for leverage submitted by a licensee under this chapter, the Administrator

(1) shall determine that the private capital of the licensee meets the requirements of section 682(a) of this title ; and

(2) shall determine, taking into account the nature of the assets of the licensee, the amount and terms of any third party debt owed by such licensee, and any other factors determined to be relevant by the Administrator, that the private capital of the licensee has not been impaired to such an extent that the issuance of additional leverage would create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government.
