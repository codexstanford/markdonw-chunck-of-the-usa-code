### CHAPTER 47— CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
#### § 2064. Substantial product hazards
##### (c) Notice of defect or failure to comply; mail notice

(1) If the Commission determines (after affording interested persons, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f) of this section) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification is required in order to adequately protect the public from such substantial product hazard, or if the Commission, after notifying the manufacturer, determines a product to be an imminently hazardous consumer product and has filed an action under section 2061 of this title , the Commission may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of the product to take any one or more of the following actions:

(A) To cease distribution of the product.

(B) To notify all persons that transport, store, distribute, or otherwise handle the product, or to which the product has been transported, sold, distributed, or otherwise handled, to cease immediately distribution of the product.

(C) To notify appropriate State and local public health officials.

(D) To give public notice of the defect or failure to comply, including posting clear and conspicuous notice on its Internet website, providing notice to any third party Internet website on which such manufacturer, retailer, distributor, or licensor has placed the product for sale, and announcements in languages other than English and on radio and television where the Commission determines that a substantial number of consumers to whom the recall is directed may not be reached by other notice.

(E) To mail notice to each person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product.

(F) To mail notice to every person to whom the person required to give notice knows such product was delivered or sold. Any such order shall specify the form and content of any notice required to be given under such order.

(2) The Commission may require a notice described in paragraph (1) to be distributed in a language other than English if the Commission determines that doing so is necessary to adequately protect the public.

(3) If a district court determines, in an action filed under section 2061 of this title , that the product that is the subject of such action is not an imminently hazardous consumer product, the Commission shall rescind any order issued under this subsection with respect to such product.
