#### § 7501. National Nanotechnology Program
##### (b) Program activities

The activities of the Program shall include

(1) developing a fundamental understanding of matter that enables control and manipulation at the nanoscale;

(2) providing grants to individual investigators and interdisciplinary teams of investigators;

(3) establishing a network of advanced technology user facilities and centers;

(4) establishing, on a merit-reviewed and competitive basis, interdisciplinary nanotechnology research centers, which shall

(A) interact and collaborate to foster the exchange of technical information and best practices;

(B) involve academic institutions or national laboratories and other partners, which may include States and industry;

(C) make use of existing expertise in nanotechnology in their regions and nationally;

(D) make use of ongoing research and development at the micrometer scale to support their work in nanotechnology; and

(E) to the greatest extent possible, be established in geographically diverse locations, encourage the participation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are part B institutions as defined in section 1061(2) of title 20 and minority institutions (as defined in section 1067k(3) of title 20 ), and include institutions located in States participating in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR);

(5) ensuring United States global leadership in the development and application of nanotechnology;

(6) advancing the United States productivity and industrial competitiveness through stable, consistent, and coordinated investments in long-term scientific and engineering research in nanotechnology;

(7) accelerating the deployment and application of nanotechnology research and development in the private sector, including startup companies;

(8) encouraging interdisciplinary research, and ensuring that processes for solicitation and evaluation of proposals under the Program encourage interdisciplinary projects and collaborations;

(9) providing effective education and training for researchers and professionals skilled in the interdisciplinary perspectives necessary for nanotechnology so that a true interdisciplinary research culture for nanoscale science, engineering, and technology can emerge;

(10) ensuring that ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concerns, including the potential use of nanotechnology in enhancing human intelligence and in developing artificial intelligence which exceeds human capacity, are considered during the development of nanotechnology by

(A) establishing a research program to identify ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concerns related to nanotechnology, and ensuring that the results of such research are widely disseminated;

(B) requiring that interdisciplinary nanotechnology research centers established under paragraph (4) include activities that address societal, ethical, and environmental concerns;

(C) insofar as possible, integrating research on societal, ethical, and environmental concerns with nanotechnology research and development, and ensuring that advances in nanotechnology bring about improvements in quality of life for all Americans; and

(D) providing, through the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office established in section 7502 of this title , for public input and outreach to be integrated into the Program by the convening of regular and ongoing public discussions, through mechanisms such as citizens’ panels, consensus conferences, and educational events, as appropriate; and

(11) encouraging research on nanotechnology advances that utilize existing processes and technologies.
