(C) The development of universal grades of steel.

(D) The application of automatic processing technology.

(E) The removal of residual elements from steel scrap.

(F) The treatment and storage of waste materials and other byproducts from steel production and processing.

(G) The development of super-plastic steel processing.

(H) The development of advanced sheet and bar steels.

(I) The development of technologies and equipment related to the production of steel that enhance the protection of the environment and the safety and health of workers.

(J) Other steel technologies which, in the judgment of the Secretary, further the purposes of this chapter.

(K) The development of technologies which reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

(2) Aluminum and other projects

(A) The production of aluminum.

(B) The application of automatic processing technology.

(C) The treatment and storage of waste materials and other byproducts from aluminum production and processing.

(D) The manufacture of aluminum mill products.

(E) Aluminum recycling technologies.

(F) The development of technologies and equipment related to the production of aluminum that enhance the protection of the environment and the safety and health of workers.

(G) Aluminum, copper, and other metals technologies which, in the judgment of the Secretary, further the purposes of this chapter.
