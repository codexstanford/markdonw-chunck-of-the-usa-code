### CHAPTER 14A— AID TO SMALL BUSINESS
#### § 650. Supervisory and enforcement authority for small business lending companies
##### (f) Procedure for revocation or suspension of loan authority and for cease and desist order

(1) Before revoking or suspending authority under subsection (d) or issuing a cease and desist order under subsection (e), the Administrator shall serve an order to show cause upon the small business lending company, non-Federally regulated lender, or other person why an order revoking or suspending the authority or a cease and desist order should not be issued. The order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administrator and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before an administrative law judge at a time and place stated in the order. Such hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of sections 554, 556, and 557 of title 5. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administrator determines that an order revoking or suspending the authority or a cease and desist order should be issued, the Administrator shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administrator and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the small business lending company, non-Federally regulated lender, or other person involved.

(2) Witnesses summoned before the Administrator shall be paid by the party at whose instance they were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.

(3) A cease and desist order, suspension or revocation issued by the Administrator, after the hearing under this subsection is final agency action for purposes of chapter 7 of title 5. An adversely aggrieved party shall have 20 days from the date of issuance of the cease and desist order, suspension or revocation, to seek judicial review in an appropriate district court.
