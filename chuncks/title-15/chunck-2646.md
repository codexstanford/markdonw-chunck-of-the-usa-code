Insofar as practicable, in effecting such exchange of goods, the Secretary shall: (1) use normal commercial trade channels; (2) take action to avoid displacing usual marketings of United States agricultural commodities and the products thereof; (3) take reasonable precautions to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries, or use for other than domestic use in the importing country, of agricultural commodities used for such exchange; and (4) give priority to commodities easily storable and those which serve as prime incentive goods to stimulate production of critical and strategic materials. The Corporation may solicit bids from, and utilize, private trading firms to effect such exchange of goods. The determination of the quantities and qualities of such materials which are desirable for stock piling and the determination of which materials are strategic and critical shall be made in the manner prescribed by section 3 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [ 50 U.S.C. 98b ]. Strategic and critical materials acquired by Commodity Credit Corporation in exchange for agricultural commodities shall, to the extent approved by the President, be transferred to the stock pile provided for by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [ 50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.]; and in the same fiscal year such materials are transferred to the stock pile the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be reimbursed for the strategic and critical materials so transferred to the stock pile from the funds made available for the purpose of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, in an amount equal to the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the material transferred to the stock pile.

The terms and conditions of each such exchange, including provisions for full reimbursement to the Commodity Credit Corporation, shall be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture. Nothing contained herein shall limit the authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation to acquire, hold, or dispose of such quantity of strategic and critical materials as it deems advisable in carrying out its functions and protecting its assets: Provided , That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, where a grain storage facility owned by the Corporation is not needed by the Corporation and, upon being offered for sale no person offers to pay the minimum price set by the Corporation for such facility for use in connection with storage or handling of agricultural commodities, then the Corporation may, without declaring such facility to be excess property, sell it by bids at not less than such minimum price to any public or private nonprofit agency or organization for use for the purposes of such agency or organization. This provision shall apply also to facilities which on the effective date of this Act have been declared excess to the needs of the Commodity Credit Corporation but have not been claimed by any other Government agency, or surplus to the needs of the Government but not disposed of pursuant to the provisions of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41.

(j) Shall determine the character of and the necessity for its obligations and expenditures and the manner in which they shall be incurred, allowed, and paid.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Corporation may, in the exercise of its power to remove and dispose of surplus agricultural commodities, export, or cause to be exported, not to exceed such amounts of commodities owned by the Corporation as will enable the Corporation to finance research and development of external combustion engines using fuel other than that derived from petroleum and petroleum products.
