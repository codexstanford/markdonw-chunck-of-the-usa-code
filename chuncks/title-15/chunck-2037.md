######## (E) The adjudicator selected to preside over a proceeding conducted under the authority of this paragraph shall decline to accept jurisdiction over any matter that

(i) does not, on its face, allege facts that, if proven to be true, would warrant reversal or modification of the Administration’s position;

(ii) is untimely filed;

(iii) is not filed in accordance with the rules of procedure governing such proceedings; or

(iv) has been decided by or is the subject of an adjudication before a court of competent jurisdiction over such matters.

(F) Proceedings conducted pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall be completed and a decision rendered, insofar as practicable, within ninety days after a petition for a hearing is filed with the adjudicating office.

(10) The Administration shall develop and implement an outreach program to inform and recruit small business concerns to apply for eligibility for assistance under this subsection. Such program shall make a sustained and substantial effort to solicit applications for certification from small business concerns located in areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas and within States having relatively few Program Participants and from small disadvantaged business concerns in industry categories that have not substantially participated in the award of contracts let under the authority of this subsection.

(11) To the maximum extent practicable, construction subcontracts awarded by the Administration pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.

(A) The Administration shall require each concern eligible to receive subcontracts pursuant to this subsection to annually prepare and submit to the Administration a capability statement. Such statement shall briefly describe such concern’s various contract performance capabilities and shall contain the name and telephone number of the Business Opportunity Specialist assigned such concern. The Administration shall separate such statements by those primarily dependent upon local contract support and those primarily requiring a national marketing effort. Statements primarily dependent upon local contract support shall be disseminated to appropriate buying activities in the marketing area of the concern. The remaining statements shall be disseminated to the Directors of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization for the appropriate agencies who shall further distribute such statements to buying activities with such agencies that may purchase the types of items or services described on the capability statements.

(B) Contracting activities receiving capability statements shall, within 60 days after receipt, contact the relevant Business Opportunity Specialist to indicate the number, type, and approximate dollar value of contract opportunities that such activities may be awarding over the succeeding 12-month period and which may be appropriate to consider for award to those concerns for which it has received capability statements.

(C) Each executive agency reporting to the Federal Procurement Data System contract actions with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000,000 in fiscal year 1988, or in any succeeding fiscal year, shall prepare a forecast of expected contract opportunities or classes of contract opportunities for the next and succeeding fiscal years that small business concerns, including those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, are capable of performing. Such forecast shall be periodically revised during such year. To the extent such information is available, the agency forecasts shall specify:

(i) The approximate number of individual contract opportunities (and the number of opportunities within a class).

(ii) The approximate dollar value, or range of dollar values, for each contract opportunity or class of contract opportunities.

(iii) The anticipated time (by fiscal year quarter) for the issuance of a procurement request.

(iv) The activity responsible for the award and administration of the contract.
