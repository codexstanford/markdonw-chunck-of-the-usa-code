#### § 2082. Interim cellulose insulation safety standard
##### (a) Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements

(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), on and after the last day of the 60-day period beginning on July 11, 1978 , the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness set forth in the General Services Administration’s specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C (as such specification was in effect on February 1, 1978 ), shall be deemed to be an interim consumer product safety standard which shall have all the authority and effect of any other consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under this chapter. During the 45-day period beginning on July 11, 1978 , the Commission may make, and shall publish in the Federal Register, such technical, nonsubstantive changes in such requirements as it deems appropriate to make such requirements suitable for promulgation as a consumer product safety standard. At the end of the 60-day period specified in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register such interim consumer product safety standard, as altered by the Commission under this paragraph.

(2) The interim consumer product safety standard established in paragraph (1) shall provide that any cellulose insulation which is produced or distributed for sale or use as a consumer product shall have a flame spread rating of 0 to 25, as such rating is set forth in the General Services Administration’s specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C.

(3) During the period for which the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) is in effect, in addition to complying with any labeling requirement established by the Commission under this chapter, each manufacturer or private labeler of cellulose insulation shall include the following statement on any container of such cellulose insulation: “ATTENTION: This material meets the applicable minimum Federal flammability standard. This standard is based upon laboratory tests only, which do not represent actual conditions which may occur in the home”. Such statement shall be located in a conspicuous place on such container and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, and color with other printed matter on such container.
