### CHAPTER 47— CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
#### § 2056a. Standards and consumer registration of durable nursery products
##### (b) Safety standards

(1) In general

The Commission shall

(A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products; and

(B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5 , promulgate consumer product safety standards that

(i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or

(ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.

(2) Timetable for rulemaking

Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008 , the Commission shall commence the rulemaking required under paragraph (1) and shall promulgate standards for no fewer than 2 categories of durable infant or toddler products every 6 months thereafter, beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories. Thereafter, the Commission shall periodically review and revise the standards set forth under this subsection to ensure that such standards provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.

(3) Judicial review

Any person adversely affected by such standards may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in section 2060(g) of this title , as added by section 236 of this Act.

(4) Process for considering subsequent revisions to voluntary standard

(A) Notice of adoption of voluntary standard

When the Commission promulgates a consumer product safety standard under this subsection that is based, in whole or in part, on a voluntary standard, the Commission shall notify the organization that issued the voluntary standard of the Commission’s action and shall provide a copy of the consumer product safety standard to the organization.

(B) Commission action on revised voluntary standard

If an organization revises a standard that has been adopted, in whole or in part, as a consumer product safety standard under this subsection, it shall notify the Commission. The revised voluntary standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title , effective 180 days after the date on which the organization notifies the Commission (or such later date specified by the Commission in the Federal Register) unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies the organization that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining the existing consumer product safety standard.
