### CHAPTER 59— RETAIL POLICIES FOR NATURAL GAS UTILITIES
#### § 3204. Special rules for standards
##### (a) Procedures for termination of gas service

The procedures for termination of service referred to in section 3203(b)(1) of this title are procedures prescribed by the State regulatory authority (with respect to gas utilities for which it has ratemaking authority) or the nonregulated gas utility which provide that

(1) no gas service to a gas consumer may be terminated unless reasonable prior notice (including notice of rights and remedies) is given to such consumer and such consumer has a reasonable opportunity to dispute the reasons for such termination, and

(2) during any period when termination of service to a gas consumer would be especially dangerous to health, as determined by the State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated gas utility, and such consumer establishes that

(A) he is unable to pay for such service in accordance with the requirements of the utility’s billing, or

(B) he is able to pay for such service but only in installments, such service may not be terminated. Such procedures shall take into account the need to include reasonable provisions for elderly and handicapped consumers.
