#### § 794. Energy conservation study
##### (a) Study of conservation methods

The Federal Energy Administrator shall conduct a study on potential methods of energy conservation and, not later than six months after June 22, 1974 , shall submit to Congress a report on the results of such study. The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(1) the energy conservation potential of restricting exports of fuels or energy-intensive products, or goods, including an analysis of balance-of-payments and foreign relations implications of any such restrictions;

(2) alternative requirements, incentives, or disincentives for increasing industrial recycling and resource recovery in order to reduce energy demand, including the economic costs and fuel consumption tradeoff which may be associated with such recycling and resource recovery in lieu of transportation and use of virgin materials; and

(3) means for incentives or disincentives to increase efficiency of industrial use of energy.
