##### (h) Management of conflicts of interest

(1) Organization policies and procedures

(2) Commission authority

The Commission shall issue final rules in accordance with subsection (n) to prohibit, or require the management and disclosure of, any conflicts of interest relating to the issuance of credit ratings by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, including, without limitation, conflicts of interest relating to

(A) the manner in which a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is compensated by the obligor, or any affiliate of the obligor, for issuing credit ratings or providing related services;

(B) the provision of consulting, advisory, or other services by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or any person associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, to the obligor, or any affiliate of the obligor;

(C) business relationships, ownership interests, or any other financial or personal interests between a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or any person associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and the obligor, or any affiliate of the obligor;

(D) any affiliation of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or any person associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, with any person that underwrites the securities or money market instruments that are the subject of a credit rating; and

(E) any other potential conflict of interest, as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

(3) Separation of ratings from sales and marketing

The rules issued under subparagraph (A) shall provide for

(i) exceptions for small nationally recognized statistical rating organizations with respect to which the Commission determines that the separation of the production of ratings and sales and marketing activities is not appropriate; and

(ii) suspension or revocation of the registration of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if the Commission finds, on the record, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that

(I) the nationally recognized statistical rating organization has committed a violation of a rule issued under this subsection; and

(II) the violation of a rule issued under this subsection affected a rating.

(4) Look-back requirement

(A) Review by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization

Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, in any case in which an employee of a person subject to a credit rating of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a security or money market instrument subject to a credit rating of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization was employed by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization and participated in any capacity in determining credit ratings for the person or the securities or money market instruments during the 1-year period preceding the date an action was taken with respect to the credit rating, the nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall

(i) conduct a review to determine whether any conflicts of interest of the employee influenced the credit rating; and

(ii) take action to revise the rating if appropriate, in accordance with such rules as the Commission shall prescribe.

(B) Review by Commission

(i) In general

The Commission shall conduct periodic reviews of the policies described in subparagraph (A) and the implementation of the policies at each nationally recognized statistical rating organization to ensure they are reasonably designed and implemented to most effectively eliminate conflicts of interest.

(ii) Timing of reviews

The Commission shall review the code of ethics and conflict of interest policy of each nationally recognized statistical rating organization

(I) not less frequently than annually; and

(II) whenever such policies are materially modified or amended.

(5) Report to Commission on certain employment transitions

(A) Report required

Each nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall report to the Commission any case such organization knows or can reasonably be expected to know where a person associated with such organization within the previous 5 years obtains employment with any obligor, issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a security or money market instrument for which the organization issued a credit rating during the 12-month period prior to such employment, if such employee

(i) was a senior officer of such organization;

(ii) participated in any capacity in determining credit ratings for such obligor, issuer, underwriter, or sponsor; or

(iii) supervised an employee described in clause (ii).

(B) Public disclosure

Upon receiving such a report, the Commission shall make such information publicly available.
