### CHAPTER 30— HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
#### § 1278a. Children’s products containing lead; lead paint rule
##### (a) General lead ban

(1) Treatment as a banned hazardous substance

Except as expressly provided in subsection (b) beginning on the dates provided in paragraph (2), any children’s product (as defined in section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act ( 15 U.S.C. 2052(a) )) that contains more lead than the limit established by paragraph (2) shall be treated as a banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.).

(2) Lead limit

(A) 600 parts per million

Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E), beginning 180 days after August 14, 2008 , the lead limit referred to in paragraph (1) is 600 parts per million total lead content by weight for any part of the product.

(B) 300 parts per million

Except as provided by subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E), beginning on the date that is 1 year after August 14, 2008 , the lead limit referred to in paragraph (1) is 300 parts per million total lead content by weight for any part of the product.

(C) 100 parts per million

Except as provided in subparagraphs (D) and (E), beginning on the date that is 3 years after August 14, 2008 , subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting “100 parts per million” for “300 parts per million” unless the Commission determines that a limit of 100 parts per million is not technologically feasible for a product or product category. The Commission may make such a determination only after notice and a hearing and after analyzing the public health protections associated with substantially reducing lead in children’s products.

(D) Alternate reduction of limit

If the Commission determines under subparagraph (C) that the 100 parts per million limit is not technologically feasible for a product or product category, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish an amount that is the lowest amount of lead, lower than 300 parts per million, the Commission determines to be technologically feasible to achieve for that product or product category. The amount of lead established by the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be substituted for the 300 parts per million limit under subparagraph (B) beginning on the date that is 3 years after August 14, 2008 .

(E) Periodic review and further reductions

The Commission shall, based on the best available scientific and technical information, periodically review and revise downward the limit set forth in this subsection, no less frequently than every 5 years after promulgation of the limit under subparagraph (C) or (D) to require the lowest amount of lead that the Commission determines is technologically feasible to achieve. The amount of lead established by the Commission under the preceding sentence shall be substituted for the lead limit in effect immediately before such revision.

(3) Application

Each limit set forth in paragraph (2) (except for the limit set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B)) shall apply only to a children’s product (as defined in section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act ( 15 U.S.C. 2052(a) )) that is manufactured after the effective date of such respective limit.
