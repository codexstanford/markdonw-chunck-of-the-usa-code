#### § 278s. Manufacturing USA
##### (d) Manufacturing USA institutes

(1) In general

For purposes of this section, a Manufacturing USA institute is an institute that

(A) has been established by a person or group of persons to address challenges in advanced manufacturing and to assist manufacturers in retaining or expanding industrial production and jobs in the United States;

(B) has a predominant focus on a manufacturing process, novel material, enabling technology, supply chain integration methodology, or another relevant aspect of advanced manufacturing, such as nanotechnology applications, advanced ceramics, photonics and optics, composites, biobased and advanced materials, flexible hybrid technologies, tool development for microelectronics, food manufacturing, superconductors, advanced battery technologies, robotics, advanced sensors, quantum information science, supply chain water optimization, aeronautics and advanced materials, and graphene and graphene commercialization;

(C) has the potential

(i) to improve the competitiveness of United States manufacturing, including key advanced manufacturing technologies such as nanotechnology, advanced ceramics, photonics and optics, composites, biobased and advanced materials, flexible hybrid technologies, tool development for microelectronics, food manufacturing, superconductors, advanced battery technologies, robotics, advanced sensors, quantum information science, supply chain water optimization, aeronautics and advanced materials, and graphene and graphene commercialization;

(ii) to accelerate non-Federal investment in advanced manufacturing production capacity in the United States; or

(iii) to enable the commercial application of new technologies or industry-wide manufacturing processes; and

(D) includes active participation among representatives from multiple industrial entities, research universities, community colleges, and other entities as appropriate, which may include industry-led consortia, career and technical education schools, Federal laboratories, State, local, and Tribal governments, businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations.

(2) Activities

(A) Required activities

For purposes of this section, a Manufacturing USA institute is also an institute that carries out the following:

(i) Research, development, and demonstration projects, including proof-of-concept development and prototyping, to reduce the cost, time, or risk of commercializing new technologies and improvements in existing technologies, processes, products, and research and development of materials to solve precompetitive industrial problems with economic or national security implications.

(ii) Development and implementation of education, training, and workforce recruitment courses, materials, and programs addressing workforce needs through training and education programs at all appropriate education levels, including programs on applied engineering.

(iii) Development of innovative methodologies and practices for supply chain integration and introduction of new technologies into supply chains, as appropriate.

(iv) Outreach and engagement with small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, including women, minority, and veteran owned manufacturing enterprises, in addition to large manufacturing enterprises.

(v) Development of roadmaps or leveraging of existing roadmaps with respect to technology areas being pursued by that Manufacturing USA institute that take into account the research and development undertaken at other Manufacturing USA institutes and Federal agencies with respect to such areas.

(B) Permissible activities

In addition to the activities set forth under subparagraph (A), a Manufacturing USA institute may carry out such other activities as may be consistent with the purposes set forth under subsection (b)(2).

(3) Additional Manufacturing USA institutes

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute and other manufacturing institutes formally recognized as Manufacturing USA institutes pursuant to Federal law or executive actions, or under pending interagency review for such recognition as of December 16, 2014 , shall be considered Manufacturing USA institutes for purposes of this section.

(B) Network participation

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), an institute that is substantially similar to an institute described by paragraphs (1) and (2) but does not meet every element of such description and does not receive financial assistance under subsection (e) may, upon request of the institute, be recognized as a Manufacturing USA institute by the Secretary for purposes of participation in the Network.

(C) Applicability

Effective beginning on December 20, 2019 , an institute shall be treated as a Manufacturing USA institute under this section and subject to subsections (b)(2), (d), and (e) in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions apply to a Manufacturing USA institute described by paragraphs (1) and (2) if such institute

(i)

(I) is, as of December 20, 2019 , considered a Manufacturing USA institute under subparagraph (A) or recognized as a Manufacturing USA institute under subparagraph (B); and

(II) as of December 20, 2019 , receives Federal financial assistance under subsection (e) or otherwise consistent with the purposes of this section;

(ii) is under pending agency review for such recognition as of December 20, 2019 ; or

(iii) is currently funded by the Department of Energy.
