If it appears to the Director at any time that a statement of record, which is in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Director may, after notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Director) within fifteen days after such notice, issue an order suspending the statement of record. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order, the Director shall so declare and thereupon the order shall cease to be effective.
