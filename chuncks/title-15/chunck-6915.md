### CHAPTER 104— SPORTS AGENT RESPONSIBILITY AND TRUST
#### § 7802. Regulation of unfair and deceptive acts and practices in connection with the contact between an athlete agent and a student athlete
##### (b) Required disclosure by athlete agents to student athletes

(1) In general

In conjunction with the entering into of an agency contract, an athlete agent shall provide to the student athlete, or, if the student athlete is under the age of 18, to such student athlete’s parent or legal guardian, a disclosure document that meets the requirements of this subsection. Such disclosure document is separate from and in addition to any disclosure which may be required under State law.

(2) Signature of student athlete

The disclosure document must be signed by the student athlete, or, if the student athlete is under the age of 18, by such student athlete’s parent or legal guardian, prior to entering into the agency contract.

(3) Required language

The disclosure document must contain, in close proximity to the signature of the student athlete, or, if the student athlete is under the age of 18, the signature of such student athlete’s parent or legal guardian, a conspicuous notice in boldface type stating: “Warning to Student Athlete: If you agree orally or in writing to be represented by an agent now or in the future you may lose your eligibility to compete as a student athlete in your sport. Within 72 hours after entering into this contract or before the next athletic event in which you are eligible to participate, whichever occurs first, both you and the agent by whom you are agreeing to be represented must notify the athletic director of the educational institution at which you are enrolled, or other individual responsible for athletic programs at such educational institution, that you have entered into an agency contract.”
