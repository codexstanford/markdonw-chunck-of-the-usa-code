### CHAPTER 47— CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
#### § 2056b. Mandatory toy safety standards
##### (d) Consideration of remaining ASTM standards

After promulgating the rules required by subsection (b), the Commission shall

(1) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 (and alternative health protective requirements to prevent or minimize flammability of children’s products) or its successor standard, and shall assess the adequacy of such standards in protecting children from safety hazards; and

(2) in accordance with section 553 of title 5 , promulgate consumer product safety rules that

(A) take into account other children’s product safety rules; and

(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such toys.
