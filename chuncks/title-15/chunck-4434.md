### CHAPTER 47— CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY
#### § 2057c. Prohibition on sale of certain products containing specified phthalates
##### (d) Exclusion for inaccessible component parts

(1) In general

The prohibitions established under subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to any component part of a children’s toy or child care article that is not accessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, as determined by the Commission. A component part is not accessible under this paragraph if such component part is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product. Reasonably foreseeable use and abuse shall include swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children’s activities, and the aging of the product.

(2) Limitation

The Commission may revoke an exclusion or all exclusions granted under paragraph (1) at any time and require that any or all component parts manufactured after such exclusion is revoked comply with the prohibitions established under subsections (a) and (b) if the Commission finds, based on scientific evidence, that such compliance is necessary to protect the public health or safety.

(3) Inaccessibility proceeding

Within 1 year after August 12, 2011 , the Commission shall

(A) promulgate a rule providing guidance with respect to what product components, or classes of components, will be considered to be inaccessible for purposes of paragraph (1); or

(B) adopt the same guidance with respect to inaccessibility that was adopted by the Commission with regards to accessibility of lead under section 1278a(b)(2)(B) of this title , with additional consideration, as appropriate, of whether such component can be placed in a child’s mouth.

(4) Application pending commission guidance

Until the Commission promulgates a rule pursuant to paragraph (3), the determination of whether a product component is inaccessible to a child shall be made in accordance with the requirements laid out in paragraph (1) for considering a component to be inaccessible to a child.
