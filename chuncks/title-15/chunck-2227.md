#### § 650. Supervisory and enforcement authority for small business lending companies
##### (d) Revocation or suspension of loan authority

(1) The Administrator may revoke or suspend the authority of a small business lending company or a non-Federally regulated lender to make, service or liquidate business loans authorized by section 636(a) of this title

(A) for false statements knowingly made in any written submission required under this chapter;

(B) for omission of a material fact from any written submission required under this chapter;

(C) for willful or repeated violation of this chapter;

(D) for willful or repeated violation of any condition imposed by the Administrator with respect to any application, request, or agreement under this chapter; or

(E) for violation of any cease and desist order of the Administrator under this section.

(2) The Administrator may revoke or suspend authority under paragraph (1) only after a hearing under subsection (f). The Administrator may delegate power to revoke or suspend authority under paragraph (1) only to the Deputy Administrator and only if the Administrator is unavailable to take such action.

(A) The Administrator, after finding extraordinary circumstances and in order to protect the financial or legal position of the United States, may issue a suspension order without conducting a hearing pursuant to subsection (f). If the Administrator issues a suspension under the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall within two business days follow the procedures set forth in subsection (f).

(B) Any suspension under paragraph (1) shall remain in effect until the Administrator makes a decision pursuant to subparagraph (4) to permanently revoke the authority of the small business lending company or non-Federally regulated lender, suspend the authority for a time certain, or terminate the suspension.

(3) The small business lending company or non-Federally regulated lender must notify borrowers of a revocation and that a new entity has been appointed to service their loans. The Administrator or an employee of the Administration designated by the Administrator may provide such notice to the borrower.

(4) Any revocation or suspension under paragraph (1) shall be made by the Administrator except that the Administrator shall delegate to an administrative law judge as that term is used in section 3105 of title 5 the authority to conduct any hearing required under subsection (f). The Administrator shall base the decision to revoke on the record of the hearing.
