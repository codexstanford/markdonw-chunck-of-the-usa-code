### CHAPTER 39A— SPECIAL PACKAGING OF HOUSEHOLD SUBSTANCES FOR PROTECTION OF CHILDREN
#### § 1473. Conventional packages, marketing
##### (a) Noncomplying packages for elderly or handicapped persons; labeling statements

For the purpose of making any household substance which is subject to a standard established under section 1472 of this title readily available to elderly or handicapped persons unable to use such substance when packaged in compliance with such standard, the manufacturer or packer, as the case may be, may package any household substance, subject to such a standard, in packaging of a single size which does not comply with such standard if

(1) the manufacturer (or packer) also supplies such substance in packages which comply with such standard; and

(2) the packages of such substance which do not meet such standard bear conspicuous labeling stating: “This package for households without young children”; except that the Commission may by regulation prescribe a substitute statement to the same effect for packaging too small to accommodate such labeling.
