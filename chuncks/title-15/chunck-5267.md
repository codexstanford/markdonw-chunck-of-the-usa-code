### CHAPTER 56A— GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH
#### § 2934. National Global Change Research Plan
##### (c) Research elements

The Plan shall provide for, but not be limited to, the following research elements:

(1) Global measurements, establishing worldwide observations necessary to understand the physical, chemical, and biological processes responsible for changes in the Earth system on all relevant spatial and time scales.

(2) Documentation of global change, including the development of mechanisms for recording changes that will actually occur in the Earth system over the coming decades.

(3) Studies of earlier changes in the Earth system, using evidence from the geological and fossil record.

(4) Predictions, using quantitative models of the Earth system to identify and simulate global environmental processes and trends, and the regional implications of such processes and trends.

(5) Focused research initiatives to understand the nature of and interaction among physical, chemical, biological, and social processes related to global change.
