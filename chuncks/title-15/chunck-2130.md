No act or omission to act pursuant to this chapter which occurs while this chapter is in effect, if requested by the President pursuant to a voluntary agreement or program approved under subsection (a) of this section and found by the President to be in the public interest as contributing to the national defense, shall be construed to be within the prohibitions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act [ 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] of the United States.
