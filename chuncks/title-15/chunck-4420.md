#### § 2056e. Consumer product safety standard for button cell or coin batteries and consumer products containing such batteries
##### (f) Revision of voluntary standard

(1) Notice to Commission

If a voluntary standard with respect to which the Commission has made a determination under subsection (d) is subsequently revised, the organization that revised the standard shall notify the Commission after the final approval of the revision.

(2) Effective date of revision

Beginning on the date that is 180 days after the Commission is notified of a revised voluntary standard described in paragraph (1) (or such later date as the Commission determines appropriate), such revised voluntary standard in whole or in part shall be considered to be a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 2058 of this title , in place of the prior version, unless, within 90 days after receiving the notice, the Commission notifies the organization that the revised voluntary standard, in whole or in part, does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining all or part of the existing consumer product safety standard.
