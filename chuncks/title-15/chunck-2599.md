The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to any debenture before 100 percent of the contribution described in paragraph (4) with respect to such debenture has been made.

(7) Alternative loss reserve

(A) Election

With respect to any eligible calendar quarter, any qualified high loss reserve PCL may elect to have the requirements of this paragraph apply in lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) for such quarter.

(B) Contributions

Except as provided under clause (ii) and paragraph (5), a qualified high loss reserve PCL that makes the election described in subparagraph (A) with respect to a calendar quarter shall not be required to make contributions to its loss reserve during such quarter.

(ii) Based on loss

A qualified high loss reserve PCL that makes the election described in subparagraph (A) with respect to any calendar quarter shall, before the last day of such quarter, make such contributions to its loss reserve as are necessary to ensure that the amount of the loss reserve of the PCL is

(I) not less than $100,000; and

(II) sufficient, as determined by a qualified independent auditor, for the PCL to meet its obligations to protect the Federal Government from risk of loss.

(iii) Certification

Before the end of any calendar quarter for which an election is in effect under subparagraph (A), the head of the PCL shall submit to the Administrator a certification that the loss reserve of the PCL is sufficient to meet such PCL’s obligation to protect the Federal Government from risk of loss. Such certification shall be in such form and submitted in such manner as the Administrator may require and shall be signed by the head of such PCL and the auditor making the determination under clause (ii)(II).

(D) Recontribution

If the requirements of this paragraph apply to a qualified high loss reserve PCL for any calendar quarter and cease to apply to such PCL for any subsequent calendar quarter, such PCL shall make a contribution to its loss reserve in such amount as the Administrator may determine provided that such amount does not exceed the amount which would result in the total amount in the loss reserve being equal to the amount which would have been in such loss reserve had this paragraph never applied to such PCL.

If a qualified high loss reserve PCL fails to meet the requirement of subparagraph (F)(iii) during any period for which an election is in effect under subparagraph (A) and such failure continues for 180 days, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (4), and (6) shall apply to such PCL as of the end of such 180-day period and such PCL shall make the contribution to its loss reserve described in subparagraph (D).
