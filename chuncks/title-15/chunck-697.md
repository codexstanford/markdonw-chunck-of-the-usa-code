#### § 78j–4. Recovery of erroneously awarded compensation policy
##### (b) Recovery of funds

The rules of the Commission under subsection (a) shall require each issuer to develop and implement a policy providing

(2) that, in the event that the issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the issuer with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the issuer will recover from any current or former executive officer of the issuer who received incentive-based compensation (including stock options awarded as compensation) during the 3-year period preceding the date on which the issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement, based on the erroneous data, in  1 excess of what would have been paid to the executive officer under the accounting restatement.
