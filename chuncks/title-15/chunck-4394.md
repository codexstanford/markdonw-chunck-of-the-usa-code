##### (d) Consumer registration requirement

(1) Rulemaking

Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 6 of title 5 or the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 ( 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008 , the Commission shall, pursuant to its authority under section 2065(b) of this title , promulgate a final consumer product safety rule to require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product

(A) to provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product;

(B) to maintain a record of the names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other contact information of consumers who register their ownership of such products with the manufacturer in order to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer campaigns to recall such products; and

(C) to permanently place the manufacturer name and contact information, model name and number, and the date of manufacture on each durable infant or toddler product.

(2) Requirements for registration form

The registration form required to be provided to consumers under paragraph (1) shall

(A) include spaces for a consumer to provide the consumer’s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

(B) include space sufficiently large to permit easy, legible recording of all desired information;

(C) be attached to the surface of each durable infant or toddler product so that, as a practical matter, the consumer must notice and handle the form after purchasing the product;

(D) include the manufacturer’s name, model name and number for the product, and the date of manufacture;

(E) include a message explaining the purpose of the registration and designed to encourage consumers to complete the registration;

(F) include an option for consumers to register through the Internet; and

(G) include a statement that information provided by the consumer shall not be used for any purpose other than to facilitate a recall of or safety alert regarding that product. In issuing regulations under this section, the Commission may prescribe the exact text and format of the required registration form.

(3) Record keeping and notification requirements

The rules required under this section shall require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product to maintain a record of registrants for each product manufactured that includes all of the information provided by each consumer registered, and to use such information to notify such consumers in the event of a voluntary or involuntary recall of or safety alert regarding such product. Each manufacturer shall maintain such a record for a period of not less than 6 years after the date of manufacture of the product. Consumer information collected by a manufacturer under this Act may not be used by the manufacturer, nor disseminated by such manufacturer to any other party, for any purpose other than notification to such consumer in the event of a product recall or safety alert.

(4) Study

The Commission shall conduct a study at such time as it considers appropriate on the effectiveness of the consumer registration forms required by this section in facilitating product recalls and whether such registration forms should be required for other children’s products. Not later than 4 years after August 14, 2008 , the Commission shall report its findings to the appropriate Congressional committees.
