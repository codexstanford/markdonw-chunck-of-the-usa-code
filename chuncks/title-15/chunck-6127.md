(B) the activities described in subsection (a)(1).

(2) Updates

The heads of the participating agencies shall update the strategic plans as appropriate.

(3) Contents

Each strategic plan shall

(B) specify how the near-term and long-term objectives complement research and development areas in which academia and the private sector are actively engaged;

(C) describe how the heads of the participating agencies will support mechanisms for foundational, large-scale, long-term, and interdisciplinary information technology research and development and for Grand Challenges, including through collaborations

(i) across Federal agencies;

(E) describe how the portions of the Program relevant to the strategic plan will address long-term challenges for which solutions require foundational, large-scale, long-term, and interdisciplinary information technology research and development.

(4) Private sector efforts

In developing, implementing, and updating strategic plans, the heads of the participating agencies, working through the National Science and Technology Council and the Program, shall coordinate with industry, academia, and other interested stakeholders to ensure, to the extent practicable, that the Federal networking and information technology research and development activities carried out under this section do not duplicate the efforts of the private sector.

(5) Recommendations

In developing and updating strategic plans, the heads of the participating agencies shall solicit recommendations and advice from

(A) the advisory committee under subsection (b);
