##### (a) Findings

Congress finds that

(1) the SBIR and STTR programs create jobs, increase capacity for technological innovation, and boost international competitiveness;

(2) increasing the quantity of applications from all States to the SBIR and STTR programs would enhance competition for such awards and the quality of the completed projects; and

(3) mentoring is a natural complement to the FAST program of reaching out to new companies regarding the SBIR and STTR programs as an effective and low-cost way to improve the likelihood that such companies will succeed in such programs in developing and commercializing their research.
