(1) Establishment

The Administrator shall establish a hydrologic research fellowship program (in this section referred to as the “program”) for qualified individuals.

(2) Qualified individual

For purposes of this section, a qualified individual is an individual who is

(A) a citizen of the United States; and

(B) enrolled in a research-based graduate program, at an institution of higher education, in a field that advances the research priorities developed by the Assistant Administrator under paragraph (7), such as

(i) hydrology;

(ii) earth sciences;

(iii) atmospheric sciences;

(iv) computer sciences;

(v) engineering;

(vi) environmental sciences;

(vii) geosciences;

(viii) urban planning; or

(ix) related social sciences.

(3) Award guidelines

Fellowships under the program shall be awarded pursuant to guidelines established by the Assistant Administrator.

(4) Selection preference

In selecting qualified individuals for participation in the program, the Assistant Administrator shall give preference to applicants from historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions.

(A) Advance the collaborative development of a flexible community-based water resources modeling system.

(B) Apply artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to advance existing hydrologic modeling capabilities.

(C) Support the evolution and integration of hydrologic modeling within an Earth Systems Modeling Framework.

(D) Improve visualizations of hydrologic model outputs.

(E) Advance the state of coupled freshwater and salt water modeling and forecasting capabilities.

(F) Advance understanding and process representation of water quality parameters.

(G) Advance the assimilation of in-situ and remotely sensed observations and data.

(H) Support the integration of social science to advance decision support services.

(I) Develop methods to study groundwater sustainability and estimate the efficiency of recharge management.
