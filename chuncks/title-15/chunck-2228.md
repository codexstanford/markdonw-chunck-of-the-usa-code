### CHAPTER 14A— AID TO SMALL BUSINESS
#### § 650. Supervisory and enforcement authority for small business lending companies
##### (e) Cease and desist order

(1) Where a small business lending company, a non-Federally regulated lender, or other person violates this chapter or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of this chapter, the Administrator may order, after the opportunity for hearing pursuant to subsection (f), the company, lender, or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administrator may delegate the authority under the preceding sentence only to the Deputy Administrator and only if the Administrator is unavailable to take such action.

(2) The Administrator, after finding extraordinary circumstances and in order to protect the financial or legal position of the United States, may issue a cease and desist order without conducting a hearing pursuant to subsection (f). If the Administrator issues a cease and desist order under the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall within two business days follow the procedures set forth in subsection (f).

(3) The Administrator may further order such small business lending company or non-Federally regulated lender or other person to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Administrator deems necessary to insure compliance with this chapter.

(4) A cease and desist order under this subsection may also provide for the suspension of authority to lend in subsection (d).
