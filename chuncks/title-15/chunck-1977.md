(D) shall notwithstanding the provisions of any other law and upon presentation by the applicant of proof of loss or damage or injury and a bona fide estimate of cost of repair, rehabilitation, or replacement, cancel the principal of any loan made to cover a loss or damage or injury resulting from such disaster, except that

Whoever wrongfully misapplies the proceeds of a loan obtained under this subsection shall be civilly liable to the Administrator in an amount equal to one-and-one half times the original principal amount of the loan.
