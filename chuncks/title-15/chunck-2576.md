(1) Level of charges

The Administration may impose an additional charge for administrative expenses with respect to each debenture for which payment of principal and interest is guaranteed under subsection (a).

The Administration shall collect a one-time fee in an amount equal to 50 basis points on the total participation in any project of any institution described in subclause (I), (II), or (III) of section 696(3)(B)(i) of this title . Such fee shall be imposed only when the participation of the institution will occupy a senior credit position to that of the development company. All proceeds of the fee shall be used to offset the cost (as that term is defined in section 661a of title 2 ) to the Administration of making guarantees under subsection (a).

(3) Development company fee

The Administration shall collect annually from each development company a fee of 0.125 percent of the outstanding principal balance of any guaranteed debenture authorized by the Administration after September 30, 1996 . Such fee shall be derived from the servicing fees collected by the development company pursuant to regulation, and shall not be derived from any additional fees imposed on small business concerns. All proceeds of the fee shall be used to offset the cost (as that term is defined in section 661a of title 2 ) to the Administration of making guarantees under subsection (a).
