#### § 80a–8. Registration of investment companies
##### (e) Failure to file registration statement or omissions of material fact

If it appears to the Commission that a registered investment company has failed to file the registration statement required by this section or a report required pursuant to section 80a–29 (a) or (b) of this title, or has filed such a registration statement or report but omitted therefrom material facts required to be stated therein, or has filed such a registration statement or report in violation of section 80a–33(b) of this title , the Commission shall notify such company by registered mail or by certified mail of the failure to file such registration statement or report, or of the respects in which such registration statement or report appears to be materially incomplete or misleading, as the case may be, and shall fix a date (in no event earlier than thirty days after the mailing of such notice) prior to which such company may file such registration statement or report or correct the same. If such registration statement or report is not filed or corrected within the time so fixed by the Commission or any extension thereof, the Commission, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, and upon such conditions and with such exemptions as it deems appropriate for the protection of investors, may by order suspend the registration of such company until such statement or report is filed or corrected, or may by order revoke such registration, if the evidence establishes

(1) that such company has failed to file a registration statement required by this section or a report required pursuant to section 80a–29(a) or (b) of this title, or has filed such a registration statement or report but omitted therefrom material facts required to be stated therein, or has filed such a registration statement or report in violation of section 80a–33(b) of this title ; and

(2) that such suspension or revocation is in the public interest.
