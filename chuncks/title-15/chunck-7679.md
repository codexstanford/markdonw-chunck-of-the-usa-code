(B) develop methods to accommodate large data sets with variable quality and scale, and to provide insight and models for complex systems;

(C) develop new approaches and maximize the use of algorithms developed through artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, natural language processing, modeling and simulation, and develop new algorithms suitable for high-performance computing systems and large biomedical data sets;

(D) advance existing and construct new data enclaves capable of securely storing data sets provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and other sources; and

(E) promote collaboration and data sharing between National Laboratories, research entities, and user facilities of the Department by providing the necessary access and secure data transfer capabilities.

(3) Coordination

In carrying out the program established under paragraph (1), the Secretary is authorized

(A) to enter into memoranda of understanding in order to carry out reimbursable agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other entities in order to maximize the effectiveness of Department research and development to improve veterans’ healthcare;

(B) to consult with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other Federal agencies as appropriate; and

(C) to ensure that data storage meets all privacy and security requirements established by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and that access to data is provided in accordance with relevant Department of Veterans Affairs data access policies, including informed consent.

(4) Report

Not later than 2 years after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs of the House of Representatives, a report detailing the effectiveness of

(A) the interagency coordination between each Federal agency involved in the research program carried out under this subsection;

(B) collaborative research achievements of the program; and

(C) potential opportunities to expand the technical capabilities of the Department.

(5) Funding

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out this subsection $27,000,000 for fiscal year 2021.
