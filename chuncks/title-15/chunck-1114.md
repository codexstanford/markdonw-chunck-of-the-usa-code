#### § 78ddd. SIPC Fund
##### (a) In general

(1) Establishment of fund

SIPC shall establish a “SIPC Fund” (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the “fund”). All amounts received by SIPC (other than amounts paid directly to any lender pursuant to any pledge securing a borrowing by SIPC) shall be deposited in the fund, and all expenditures made by SIPC shall be made out of the fund.

(2) Balance of the fund

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the balance of the fund at any time shall consist of the aggregate at such time of the following items:

(A) Cash on hand or on deposit.

(B) Amounts invested in United States Government or agency securities.

(C) Such confirmed lines of credit as SIPC may from time to time maintain, other than those maintained pursuant to paragraph (4).

(3) Confirmed lines of credit

For purposes of this section, the amount of confirmed lines of credit as of any time is the aggregate amount which SIPC at such time has the right to borrow from banks and other financial institutions under confirmed lines of credit or other written agreements which provide that moneys so borrowed are to be repayable by SIPC not less than one year from the time of such borrowings (including, for purposes of determining when such moneys are repayable, all rights of extension, refunding, or renewal at the election of SIPC).

(4) Other lines

SIPC may maintain such other confirmed lines of credit as it considers necessary or appropriate, and such other confirmed lines of credit shall not be included in the balance of the fund, but amounts received from such lines of credit may be disbursed by SIPC under this chapter as though such amounts were part of the fund.
