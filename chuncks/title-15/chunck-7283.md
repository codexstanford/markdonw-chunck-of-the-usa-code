#### § 8952. Research and coordination plan for enhanced response on emerging contaminants
##### (d) Federal technical assistance and support for States

(1) Study

(A) In general

Not later than 1 year after December 20, 2019 , the Administrator shall conduct a study on actions the Administrator can take to increase technical assistance and support for States with respect to emerging contaminants in drinking water samples.

(B) Contents of study

In carrying out the study described in subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall identify

(i) methods and effective treatment options to increase technical assistance and support with respect to emerging contaminants to States, including identifying opportunities for States to improve communication with various audiences about the risks associated with emerging contaminants;

(ii) means to facilitate access to qualified contract testing laboratory facilities that conduct analyses for emerging contaminants; and

(iii) actions to be carried out at existing Federal laboratory facilities, including the research facilities of the Administrator, to provide technical assistance and support for States that require testing facilities for emerging contaminants.

(C) Availability of analytical resources

In carrying out the study described in subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall consider

(i) the availability of

(I) Federal and non-Federal laboratory capacity; and

(II) validated methods to detect and analyze contaminants; and

(ii) other factors determined to be appropriate by the Administrator.

(2) Report

Not later than 18 months after December 20, 2019 , the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report describing the results of the study described in paragraph (1).

(3) Program to provide Federal assistance to States

(A) In general

Not later than 3 years after December 20, 2019 , based on the findings in the report described in paragraph (2), the Administrator shall develop a program to provide technical assistance and support to eligible States for the testing and analysis of emerging contaminants.

(B) Application

(i) In general

To be eligible for technical assistance and support under this paragraph, a State shall submit to the Administrator an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Administrator may require.

(ii) Criteria

The Administrator shall evaluate an application for technical assistance and support under this paragraph on the basis of merit using criteria identified by the Administrator, including

(I) the laboratory facilities available to the State;

(II) the availability and applicability of existing analytical methodologies;

(III) the potency and severity of the emerging contaminant, if known; and

(IV) the prevalence and magnitude of the emerging contaminant.

(iii) Prioritization

In selecting States to receive technical assistance and support under this paragraph, the Administrator

(I) shall give priority to States with affected areas primarily in financially distressed communities;

(II) may

(aa) waive the application process in an emergency situation; and

(bb) require an abbreviated application process for the continuation of work specified in a previously approved application that continues to meet the criteria described in clause (ii); and

(III) shall consider the relative expertise and availability of

(aa) Federal and non-Federal laboratory capacity available to the State;

(bb) analytical resources available to the State; and

(cc) other types of technical assistance available to the State.

(C) Database of available resources

The Administrator shall establish and maintain a database of resources available through the program developed under subparagraph (A) to assist States with testing for emerging contaminants that

(i) is

(I) available to States and stakeholder groups determined by the Administrator to have scientific or material interest in emerging contaminants, including

(aa) drinking water and wastewater utilities;

(bb) laboratories;

(cc) Federal and State emergency responders;

(dd) State primacy agencies;

(ee) public health agencies; and

(ff) water associations;

(II) searchable; and

(III) accessible through the website of the Administrator; and

(ii) includes a description of

(I) qualified contract testing laboratory facilities that conduct analyses for emerging contaminants; and

(II) the resources available in Federal laboratory facilities to test for emerging contaminants.

(D) Water contaminant information tool

The Administrator shall integrate the database established under subparagraph (C) into the Water Contaminant Information Tool of the Environmental Protection Agency.

(4) Funding

Of the amounts available to the Administrator, the Administrator may use not more than $15,000,000 in a fiscal year to carry out this subsection.
