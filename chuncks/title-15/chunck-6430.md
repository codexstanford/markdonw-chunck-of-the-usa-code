#### § 6713. Title insurance activities of national banks and their affiliates
##### (b) Nondiscrimination parity exception

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including section 6701 of this title ), in the case of any State in which banks organized under the laws of such State are authorized to sell title insurance as agent, a national bank may sell title insurance as agent in such State, but only in the same manner, to the same extent, and under the same restrictions as such State banks are authorized to sell title insurance as agent in such State.

(2) Coordination with “wildcard” provision

A State law which authorizes State banks to engage in any activities in such State in which a national bank may engage shall not be treated as a statute which authorizes State banks to sell title insurance as agent, for purposes of paragraph (1).
