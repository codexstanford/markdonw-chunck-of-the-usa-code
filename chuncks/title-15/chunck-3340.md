### CHAPTER 30— HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
#### § 1262. Declaration of hazardous substances
##### (g) Publication of standard; termination of proceeding for promulgation of regulation; monitoring of compliance

(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (f)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title or subsection (e) of this section, as the case may be, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in a notice provided under subsection (f)(1), the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed regulation under such section or subsection.

(2) If the Commission determines that

(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (f)(6) is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and

(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard, the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a regulation under section 1261(q)(1) of this title or subsection (e) of this section, respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.

(3) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards

(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (2) of this subsection;

(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or

(C) whose development the Commission has monitored.
