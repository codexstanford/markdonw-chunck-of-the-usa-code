###### (e) Gathering of Information.

(1) In general .

In carrying out the functions required under subsection (c), the Office may

(A) receive and collect data and information on and from the insurance industry and insurers;

(B) enter into information-sharing agreements;

(C) analyze and disseminate data and information; and

(D) issue reports regarding all lines of insurance except health insurance.

(2) Collection of information from insurers and affiliates.

(A) In general .

Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Office may require an insurer, or any affiliate of an insurer, to submit such data or information as the Office may reasonably require in carrying out the functions described under subsection (c).

(B) Rule of construction .

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “insurer” means any entity that writes insurance or reinsures risks and issues contracts or policies in 1 or more States.

(3) Exception for small insurers .

Paragraph (2) shall not apply with respect to any insurer or affiliate thereof that meets a minimum size threshold that the Office may establish, whether by order or rule.

(4) Advance coordination .

Before collecting any data or information under paragraph (2) from an insurer, or affiliate of an insurer, the Office shall coordinate with each relevant Federal agency and State insurance regulator (or other relevant Federal or State regulatory agency, if any, in the case of an affiliate of an insurer) and any publicly available sources to determine if the information to be collected is available from, and may be obtained in a timely manner by, such Federal agency or State insurance regulator, individually or collectively, other regulatory agency, or publicly available sources. If the Director determines that such data or information is available, and may be obtained in a timely manner, from such an agency, regulator, regulatory agency, or source, the Director shall obtain the data or information from such agency, regulator, regulatory agency, or source. If the Director determines that such data or information is not so available, the Director may collect such data or information from an insurer (or affiliate) only if the Director complies with the requirements of subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code (relating to Federal information policy; commonly known as the Paperwork Reduction Act), in collecting such data or information. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each such relevant Federal agency and State insurance regulator or other Federal or State regulatory agency is authorized to provide to the Office such data or information.

(5) Confidentiality.

(A) Retention of privilege .

The submission of any nonpublicly available data and information to the Office under this subsection shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege arising under Federal or State law (including the rules of any Federal or State court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject.

(B) Continued application of prior confidentiality agreements .

Any requirement under Federal or State law to the extent otherwise applicable, or any requirement pursuant to a written agreement in effect between the original source of any nonpublicly available data or information and the source of such data or information to the Office, regarding the privacy or confidentiality of any data or information in the possession of the source to the Office, shall continue to apply to such data or information after the data or information has been provided pursuant to this subsection to the Office.

(C) Information-sharing agreement .

Any data or information obtained by the Office may be made available to State insurance regulators, individually or collectively, through an information-sharing agreement that

(i) shall comply with applicable Federal law; and

(ii) shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege under Federal or State law (including the rules of any Federal or State court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject.

(D) Agency disclosure requirements .

Section 552 of title 5 , United States Code, shall apply to any data or information submitted to the Office by an insurer or an affiliate of an insurer.

(6) Subpoenas and enforcement .

The Director shall have the power to require by subpoena the production of the data or information requested under paragraph (2), but only upon a written finding by the Director that such data or information is required to carry out the functions described under subsection (c) and that the Office has coordinated with such regulator or agency as required under paragraph (4). Subpoenas shall bear the signature of the Director and shall be served by any person or class of persons designated by the Director for that purpose. In the case of contumacy or failure to obey a subpoena, the subpoena shall be enforceable by order of any appropriate district court of the United States. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.
