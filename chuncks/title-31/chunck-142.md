#### § 732. Personnel management system
###### (c) Under the personnel management system

(1) the Comptroller General shall publish a schedule of basic pay rates for officers and employees of the Office;

(2) except as provided in clause (4) of this subsection and section 733(a)(3)(A) of this title , the highest basic pay rate under the pay schedule may not be more than the rate for level III of the Executive Level, except that the total amount of cash compensation in any year shall be subject to the limitations provided under section 5307(a)(1) of title 5 ;

(3) except as provided under section 733(a)(3)(B) of this title , basic rates of officers and employees of the Office shall be adjusted annually to such extent as determined by the Comptroller General, and in making that determination the Comptroller General shall consider

(A) the principle that equal pay should be provided for work of equal value within each local pay area;

(B) the need to protect the purchasing power of officers and employees of the Office, taking into consideration the Consumer Price Index or other appropriate indices;

(C) any existing pay disparities between officers and employees of the Office and non-Federal employees in each local pay area;

(D) the pay rates for the same levels of work for officers and employees of the Office and non-Federal employees in each local pay area;

(E) the appropriate distribution of agency funds between annual adjustments under this section and performance-based compensation; and

(F) such other criteria as the Comptroller General considers appropriate, including, but not limited to, the funding level for the Office, amounts allocated for performance-based compensation, and the extent to which the Office is succeeding in fulfilling its mission and accomplishing its strategic plan; notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, an adjustment under this paragraph shall not be applied in the case of any officer or employee whose performance is not at a satisfactory level, as determined by the Comptroller General for purposes of such adjustment;

(4) the pay schedule for officers and employees of the Office may provide that the basic pay rates for not more than 129 positions (including senior-level positions under section 732a of this title ) may be at rates not more than the rate of basic pay payable for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule, less the number of positions in the General Accounting Office Senior Executive Service  1 under section 733 of this title (except positions included in the Service under section 733(c) of this title and senior-level positions described in section 732a(b) of this title ); and

(5) the Comptroller General shall prescribe regulations under which an officer or employee of the Office shall be entitled to pay retention if, as a result of any reduction-in-force or other workforce adjustment procedure, position reclassification, or other appropriate circumstances as determined by the Comptroller General, such officer or employee is placed in or holds a position in a lower grade or band with a maximum rate of basic pay that is less than the rate of basic pay payable to the officer or employee immediately before the reduction in grade or band; such regulations

(A) shall provide that the officer or employee shall be entitled to continue receiving the rate of basic pay that was payable to the officer or employee immediately before the reduction in grade or band until such time as the retained rate becomes less than the maximum rate for the grade or band of the position held by such officer or employee; and

(B) shall include provisions relating to the minimum period of time for which an officer or employee must have served or for which the position must have been classified at the higher grade or band in order for pay retention to apply, the events that terminate the right to pay retention (apart from the one described in subparagraph (A)), and exclusions based on the nature of an appointment; in prescribing regulations under this subparagraph, the Comptroller General shall be guided by the provisions of sections 5362 and 5363 of title 5.
