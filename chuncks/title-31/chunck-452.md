#### § 3515. Financial statements of agencies
###### (b) Each audited financial statement of a covered executive agency under this section shall reflect

(e)

(1) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may exempt a covered executive agency, except an agency described in section 901(b), from the requirements of this section with respect to a fiscal year if

(A) the total amount of budget authority available to the agency for the fiscal year does not exceed $25,000,000; and

(B) the Director determines that requiring an annual audited financial statement for the agency with respect to the fiscal year is not warranted due to the absence of risks associated with the agency’s operations, the agency’s demonstrated performance, or other factors that the Director considers relevant.
