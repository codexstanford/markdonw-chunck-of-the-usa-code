#### § 313. Federal Insurance Office
###### (f) Preemption of State Insurance Measures.

(1) Standard .

A State insurance measure shall be preempted pursuant to this section or section 314 if, and only to the extent that the Director determines, in accordance with this subsection, that the measure

(A) results in less favorable treatment of a non-United States insurer domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction that is subject to a covered agreement than a United States insurer domiciled, licensed, or otherwise admitted in that State; and

(B) is inconsistent with a covered agreement.

(2) Determination.

(A) Notice of potential inconsistency .

Before making any determination under paragraph (1), the Director shall

(i) notify and consult with the appropriate State regarding any potential inconsistency or preemption;

(ii) notify and consult with the United States Trade Representative regarding any potential inconsistency or preemption;

(iii) cause to be published in the Federal Register notice of the issue regarding the potential inconsistency or preemption, including a description of each State insurance measure at issue and any applicable covered agreement;

(iv) provide interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments to the Office; and

(v) consider any comments received.

(B) Scope of review .

For purposes of this subsection, any determination of the Director regarding State insurance measures, and any preemption under paragraph (1) as a result of such determination, shall be limited to the subject matter contained within the covered agreement involved and shall achieve a level of protection for insurance or reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under State insurance or reinsurance regulation.

(C) Notice of determination of inconsistency .

Upon making any determination under paragraph (1), the Director shall

(i) notify the appropriate State of the determination and the extent of the inconsistency;

(ii) establish a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 30 days, before the determination shall become effective; and

(iii) notify the Committees on Financial Services and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and Finance of the Senate.

(3) Notice of effectiveness .

Upon the conclusion of the period referred to in paragraph (2)(C)(ii), if the basis for such determination still exists, the determination shall become effective and the Director shall

(A) cause to be published a notice in the Federal Register that the preemption has become effective, as well as the effective date; and

(B) notify the appropriate State.

(4) Limitation .

No State may enforce a State insurance measure to the extent that such measure has been preempted under this subsection.
