###### (n) Redesign and Issuance of Circulating $1 Coins Honoring Each of the Presidents of the United States.

(1) Redesign beginning in 2007 .

Notwithstanding subsection (d) and in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, $1 coins issued during the period beginning January 1, 2007 , and ending upon the termination of the program under paragraph (8), shall

(A) have designs on the obverse selected in accordance with paragraph (2)(B) which are emblematic of the Presidents of the United States; and

(B) have a design on the reverse selected in accordance with paragraph (2)(A).

(2) Design requirements .

The $1 coins issued in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) shall meet the following design requirements:

(A) Coin reverse .

The design on the reverse shall bear

(i) a likeness of the Statue of Liberty extending to the rim of the coin and large enough to provide a dramatic representation of Liberty while not being large enough to create the impression of a “2-headed” coin;

(ii) the inscription “$1”; and

(iii) the inscription “United States of America”.

(B) Coin obverse .

The design on the obverse shall contain

(i) the name and likeness of a President of the United States; and

(ii) basic information about the President, including

(I) the dates or years of the term of office of such President; and

(II) a number indicating the order of the period of service in which the President served.

(C) Edge-incused inscriptions.

(i) In general .

The inscription of the year of minting or issuance of the coin and the inscription “E Pluribus Unum” shall be edge-incused into the coin.

(ii) Preservation of distinctive edge .

The edge-incusing of the inscriptions under clause (i) on coins issued under this subsection shall be done in a manner that preserves the distinctive edge of the coin so that the denomination of the coin is readily discernible, including by individuals who are blind or visually impaired.

(D) Inscriptions of “liberty” .

Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (d)(1), because the use of a design bearing the likeness of the Statue of Liberty on the reverse of the coins issued under this subsection adequately conveys the concept of Liberty, the inscription of “Liberty” shall not appear on the coins.

(E) Limitation in series to deceased presidents .

No coin issued under this subsection may bear the image of a living former or current President, or of any deceased former President during the 2-year period following the date of the death of that President.

(F) Inscription of “in god we trust” .

The design on the obverse or the reverse shall bear the inscription “In God We Trust”.

(3) Issuance of coins commemorating presidents.

(A) Order of issuance .

The coins issued under this subsection commemorating Presidents of the United States shall be issued in the order of the period of service of each President, beginning with President George Washington.

(B) Treatment of period of service.

(i) In general .

Subject to clause (ii), only 1 coin design shall be issued for a period of service for any President, no matter how many consecutive terms of office the President served.

(ii) Nonconsecutive terms .

If a President has served during 2 or more nonconsecutive periods of service, a coin shall be issued under this subsection for each such nonconsecutive period of service.

(4) Issuance of coins commemorating 4 presidents during each year of the period.

(A) In general .

The designs for the $1 coins issued during each year of the period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be emblematic of 4 Presidents until each President has been so honored, subject to paragraph (2)(E).

(B) Number of 4 circulating coin designs in each year .

The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of $1 coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each year of the period referred to in paragraph (1).

(5) Legal tender .

The coins minted under this title shall be legal tender, as provided in section 5103.

(6) Treatment as numismatic items .

For purposes of section  1 5134 and 5136, all coins minted under this subsection shall be considered to be numismatic items.

(7) Issuance of numismatic coins .

The Secretary may mint and issue such number of $1 coins of each design selected under this subsection in uncirculated and proof qualities as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(8) Termination of program .

The issuance of coins under this subsection shall terminate when each President has been so honored, subject to paragraph (2)(E), and may not be resumed except by an Act of Congress.

(9) Reversion to preceding design .

Upon the termination of the issuance of coins under this subsection, the design of all $1 coins shall revert to the so-called “Sacagawea-design” $1 coins.
