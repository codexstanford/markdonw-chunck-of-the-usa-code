(i) the numerator is the percentage of the labor force of the State that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes); and

(ii) the denominator is the percentage of the labor force of the United States that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes) bears to
