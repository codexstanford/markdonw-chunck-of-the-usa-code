###### (e) The personnel management system shall provide
######## (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an employee may not be released, due to a reduction in force, unless such employee is given written notice at least 60 days before such employee is so released. Such notice shall include

(i) the personnel action to be taken with respect to the employee involved;

(ii) the effective date of the action;

(iii) a description of the procedures applicable in identifying employees for release;

(iv) the employee’s ranking relative to other competing employees, and how that ranking was determined; and

(v) a description of any appeal or other rights which may be available.

(B) The Comptroller General may, in writing, shorten the period of advance notice required under subparagraph (A) with respect to a particular reduction in force, if necessary because of circumstances not reasonably foreseeable, except that such period may not be less than 30 days.

(i) The regulations under subsection (h) shall include provisions under which, at the discretion of the Comptroller General, the opportunity to separate voluntarily (in order to permit the retention of an individual occupying a similar position) shall, with respect to the Government Accountability Office, be available to the same extent and in the same manner as described in subsection (f)(1)–(4) of section 3502 of title 5 (with respect to the Department of Defense or a military department).

(j)

(1) For purposes of this subsection

(A) the term “pay increase”, as used with respect to an officer or employee in connection with a year, means the total increase in the rate of basic pay (expressed as a percentage) of such officer or employee, taking effect under section 731(b) and subsection (c)(3) in such year;

(B) the term “required minimum percentage”, as used with respect to an officer or employee in connection with a year, means the percentage equal to the total increase in rates of basic pay (expressed as a percentage) taking effect under sections 5303 and 5304–5304a of title 5 in such year with respect to General Schedule positions within the pay locality (as defined by section 5302(5) of title 5 ) in which the position of such officer or employee is located;

(C) the term “covered officer or employee”, as used with respect to a pay increase, means any individual

(i) who is an officer or employee of the Government Accountability Office, other than an officer or employee described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 4(c)(1) of the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008, determined as of the effective date of such pay increase; and

(ii) whose performance is at least at a satisfactory level, as determined by the Comptroller General under the provisions of subsection (c)(3) for purposes of the adjustment taking effect under such provisions in such year; and

(D) the term “nonpermanent merit pay” means any amount payable under section 731(b) which does not constitute basic pay.

(2)

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if (disregarding this subsection) the pay increase that would otherwise take effect with respect to a covered officer or employee in a year would be less than the required minimum percentage for such officer or employee in such year, the Comptroller General shall provide for a further increase in the rate of basic pay of such officer or employee.
