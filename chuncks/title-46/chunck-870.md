###### (e) Disclosure of Certain Terms .

(1) Definitions .

In this subsection, the terms “dock area” and “within the port area” have the same meaning and scope as in the applicable collective bargaining agreement between the requesting labor organization and the carrier.

(2) Disclosure .

An ocean common carrier that is a party to or is otherwise subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization shall, in response to a written request by the labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the following work at a dock area or within a port area in the United States with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract:

(A) The movement of the shipper’s cargo on a dock area or within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area or within the port area.

(B) The assignment of intraport carriage of the shipper’s cargo between areas on a dock or within the port area.

(C) The assignment of the carriage of the shipper’s cargo between a container yard on a dock area or within the port area and a rail yard adjacent to the container yard.

(D) The assignment of container freight station work and container maintenance and repair work performed at a dock area or within the port area.

(3) Within reasonable time .

The common carrier shall provide the information described in paragraph (2) to the requesting labor organization within a reasonable period of time.

(4) Existence of collective bargaining agreement .

This subsection does not require the disclosure of information by an ocean common carrier unless there exists an applicable and otherwise lawful collective bargaining agreement pertaining to that carrier. A disclosure by an ocean common carrier may not be deemed an admission or an agreement that any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A dispute about whether any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the responsibility of an ocean common carrier under a collective bargaining agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act ( 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), and without reference to this subsection.

(5) Effect under other laws .

This subsection does not affect the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this part or any other Federal or State law of any collective bargaining agreement or element thereof, including any element that constitutes an essential term of a service contract.
