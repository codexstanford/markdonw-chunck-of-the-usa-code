For a taxable year for which there is a nonqualified withdrawal (including an amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under subsection (e)), the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) shall be determined by

(A) excluding the withdrawal from gross income; and

(B) increasing the tax imposed by chapter 1 of such Code by the product of the amount of the withdrawal and the highest tax rate specified in section 1 (or section 11 for a corporation) of such Code ( 26 U.S.C. 1 , 11).

(2) Maximum tax rate .

For that portion of a nonqualified withdrawal made from the capital gain account during a taxable year to which section 1(h) or 1201(a)  1 of such Code ( 26 U.S.C. 1(h) , 1201(a)) applies, the tax rate used under paragraph (1)(B) may not exceed 20 percent (or 34 percent for a corporation).

(3) Tax benefit rule .

If any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal is properly attributable to deposits (except earnings on deposits) made by the taxpayer in a taxable year that did not reduce the taxpayer’s liability for tax under chapter 1 of such Code (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) for a taxable year before the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs

(A) that portion shall not be taken into account under paragraph (1); and

(B) an amount equal to that portion shall be allowed as a deduction under section 172 of such Code ( 26 U.S.C. 172 ) for the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs.

(4) Coordination with deduction for net operating losses .

A nonqualified withdrawal excluded from gross income under paragraph (1) shall be excluded in determining taxable income under section 172(b)(2) of such Code ( 26 U.S.C. 172(b)(2) ).
