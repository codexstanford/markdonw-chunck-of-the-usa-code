(D) Review of classified evidence by administrative law judge.

(i) Review .

As part of a review conducted under this section, if the decision of the Secretary was based on classified information (as defined in section 1(a) of the Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C.

(E) New evidence .

The Secretary shall establish a process under which an individual may submit a new request for a waiver, notwithstanding confirmation by the administrative law judge of the Secretary’s initial denial of the waiver, if the request is supported by substantial evidence that was not available to the Secretary at the time the initial waiver request was denied.

(4) The Secretary shall establish an appeals process under this section for individuals found to be ineligible for a transportation worker identification credential that includes notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
