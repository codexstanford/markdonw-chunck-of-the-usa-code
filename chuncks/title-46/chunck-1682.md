#### § 55108. Platform jackets
###### (c) Procedures To Maximize Use of Coastwise Qualified Vessels .

The Secretary of Transportation shall adopt procedures implementing this section that are reasonably designed to provide timely information so as to maximize the use of coastwise qualified vessels. The procedures shall, among other things, establish that for purposes of this section, a coastwise qualified vessel shall be deemed to be not available only if

(1) on application by an owner or operator for the use of a non-coastwise qualified launch barge for transportation of a platform jacket under this section (which application shall include all relevant information, including engineering details and timing requirements), the Secretary promptly publishes a notice in the Federal Register

(A) describing the project and the platform jacket involved;

(B) advising that all relevant information reasonably needed to assess the transportation requirements for the platform jacket will be made available to interested parties on request; and

(C) requesting that information on the availability of coastwise qualified vessels be submitted within 30 days after publication of that notice; and

(2)

(A) no information is submitted to the Secretary within that 30 day period; or

(B) the owner or operator of a coastwise qualified vessel submits information to the Secretary asserting that the owner or operator has a suitable coastwise qualified vessel available for the transportation, but the Secretary determines, within 90 days after the notice is first published, that the coastwise qualified vessel is not suitable or reasonably available for the transportation.
