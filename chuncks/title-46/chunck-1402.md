Except as otherwise provided by law, the Government shall not be liable for disruption of a Contractor’s commercial business or other consequential damages to a Contractor arising from the activation of the Contingency Agreement.

In any action in any Federal or State court for breach of third-party contract, there shall be available as an affirmative defense that the alleged breach of contract was caused predominantly by action taken to carry out a Contingent Agreement.
