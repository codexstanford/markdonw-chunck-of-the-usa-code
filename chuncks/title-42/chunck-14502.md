### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (gg) Standby mode energy use

(1) Definitions

(A) In general

Unless the Secretary determines otherwise pursuant to subparagraph (B), in this subsection:

(i) Active mode

The term “active mode” means the condition in which an energy-using product

(I) is connected to a main power source;

(II) has been activated; and

(III) provides 1 or more main functions.

(ii) Off mode

The term “off mode” means the condition in which an energy-using product

(I) is connected to a main power source; and

(II) is not providing any standby or active mode function.

(iii) Standby mode

The term “standby mode” means the condition in which an energy-using product

(I) is connected to a main power source; and

(II) offers 1 or more of the following user-oriented or protective functions:

(aa) To facilitate the activation or deactivation of other functions (including active mode) by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer.

(bb) Continuous functions, including information or status displays (including clocks) or sensor-based functions.

(B) Amended definitions

The Secretary may, by rule, amend the definitions under subparagraph (A), taking into consideration the most current versions of Standards 62301 and 62087 of the International Electrotechnical Commission.

(2) Test procedures

(A) In general

Test procedures for all covered products shall be amended pursuant to section 6293 of this title to include standby mode and off mode energy consumption, taking into consideration the most current versions of Standards 62301 and 62087 of the International Electrotechnical Commission, with such energy consumption integrated into the overall energy efficiency, energy consumption, or other energy descriptor for each covered product, unless the Secretary determines that

(i) the current test procedures for a covered product already fully account for and incorporate the standby mode and off mode energy consumption of the covered product; or

(ii) such an integrated test procedure is technically infeasible for a particular covered product, in which case the Secretary shall prescribe a separate standby mode and off mode energy use test procedure for the covered product, if technically feasible.

(B) Deadlines

The test procedure amendments required by subparagraph (A) shall be prescribed in a final rule no later than the following dates:

(i) December 31, 2008 , for battery chargers and external power supplies.

(ii) March 31, 2009 , for clothes dryers, room air conditioners, and fluorescent lamp ballasts.

(iii) June 30, 2009 , for residential clothes washers.

(iv) September 30, 2009 , for residential furnaces and boilers.

(v) March 31, 2010 , for residential water heaters, direct heating equipment, and pool heaters.

(vi) March 31, 2011 , for residential dishwashers, ranges and ovens, microwave ovens, and dehumidifiers.

(C) Prior product standards

The test procedure amendments adopted pursuant to subparagraph (B) shall not be used to determine compliance with product standards established prior to the adoption of the amended test procedures.

(3) Incorporation into standard

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), based on the test procedures required under paragraph (2), any final rule establishing or revising a standard for a covered product, adopted after July 1, 2010 , shall incorporate standby mode and off mode energy use into a single amended or new standard, pursuant to subsection ( o ), if feasible.

(B) Separate standards

If not feasible, the Secretary shall prescribe within the final rule a separate standard for standby mode and off mode energy consumption, if justified under subsection ( o ).
