### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300e–7. General provisions relating to loan guarantees and loans
##### (b) Application requirements

(1) The Secretary may not approve an application for a loan under this subchapter unless

(A) the Secretary is reasonably satisfied that the applicant therefor will be able to make payments of principal and interest thereon when due, and

(B) the applicant provides the Secretary with reasonable assurances that there will be available to it such additional funds as may be necessary to complete the project or undertaking with respect to which such loan is requested.

(2) Any loan made under this subchapter shall (A) have such security, (B) have such maturity date, (C) be repayable in such installments, (D) on the date the loan is made, bear interest at a rate comparable to the rate of interest prevailing on such date with respect to marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities, adjusted to provide for appropriate administrative charges, and (E) be subject to such other terms and conditions (including provisions for recovery in case of default) as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter while adequately protecting the financial interests of the United States. On the date disbursements are made under a loan after the initial disbursement under the loan, the Secretary may change the rate of interest on the amount of the loan disbursed on that date to a rate which is comparable to the rate of interest prevailing on the date the subsequent disbursement is made with respect to marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities, adjusted to provide for appropriate administrative charges.

(3) The Secretary may, for good cause but with due regard to the financial interests of the United States, waive any right of recovery which he has by reason of the failure of a borrower to make payments of principal of and interest on a loan made under this subchapter, except that if such loan is sold and guaranteed, any such waiver shall have no effect upon the Secretary’s guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest.
