### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 238q. Liability regarding emergency use of automated external defibrillators
##### (c) Rules of construction

(1) In general

The following applies with respect to this section:

(A) This section does not establish any cause of action, or require that an automated external defibrillator device be placed at any building or other location.

(B) With respect to a class of persons for which this section provides immunity from civil liability, this section supersedes the law of a State only to the extent that the State has no statute or regulations that provide persons in such class with immunity for civil liability arising from the use by such persons of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations (within the meaning of the State law or regulation involved).

(C) This section does not waive any protection from liability for Federal officers or employees under

(i) section 233 of this title ; or

(ii) sections 1346(b), 2672, and 2679 of title 28 or under alternative benefits provided by the United States where the availability of such benefits precludes a remedy under section 1346(b) of title 28 .

(2) Civil actions under Federal law

(A) In general

The applicability of subsections (a) and (b) includes applicability to any action for civil liability described in subsection (a) that arises under Federal law.

(B) Federal areas adopting State law

If a geographic area is under Federal jurisdiction and is located within a State but out of the jurisdiction of the State, and if, pursuant to Federal law, the law of the State applies in such area regarding matters for which there is no applicable Federal law, then an action for civil liability described in subsection (a) that in such area arises under the law of the State is subject to subsections (a) through (c) in lieu of any related State law that would apply in such area in the absence of this subparagraph.
