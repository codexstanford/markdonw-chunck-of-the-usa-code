(I) In general .

Not later than 1 year after December 19, 2007 , the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking to consider

(aa) the effectiveness of current lamp labeling for power levels or watts, light output or lumens, and lamp lifetime; and

(bb) alternative labeling approaches that will help consumers to understand new high-efficiency lamp products and to base the purchase decisions of the consumers on the most appropriate source that meets the requirements of the consumers for lighting level, light quality, lamp lifetime, and total lifecycle cost.

(II) Completion .

The Commission shall

(aa) complete the rulemaking not later than the date that is 30 months after December 19, 2007 ; and

(bb) consider reopening the rulemaking not later than 180 days before the effective dates of the standards for general service incandescent lamps established under section 6295(i)(1)(A) of this title , if the Commission determines that further labeling changes are needed to help consumers understand lamp alternatives.

(ii) If the marking and labeling requirements of ASME A112.18.1M–1989 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Commission shall amend the labeling rules established pursuant to clause (i) to be consistent with such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless such requirements are inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or the requirement specified in clause (i) requiring each showerhead and flow restricting or controlling spout-end device to bear a permanent legible marking indicating the flow rate of such product.

(ii) If the marking and labeling requirements of ASME A112.19.2M–1990 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Commission shall amend the labeling rules established pursuant to clause (i) to be consistent with such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless such requirements are inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or the requirement specified in clause (i) requiring each fixture and flushometer valve to bear a permanent legible marking indicating the water use of such fixture or flushometer valve.

(iii) Any labeling rules prescribed under this subparagraph before January 1, 1997 , shall provide that, with respect to any gravity tank-type white 2-piece toilet which has a water use greater than 1.6 gallons per flush (gpf), any printed matter distributed or displayed in connection with such product (including packaging and point of sale material, catalog material, and print advertising) shall include, in a conspicuous manner, the words “For Commercial Use Only”.
