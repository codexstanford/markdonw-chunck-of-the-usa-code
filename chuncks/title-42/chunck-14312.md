#### § 6239. Development, operation, and maintenance of the Reserve
##### (g) Acquisition of property by negotiation as prerequisite to condemnation

Before any condemnation proceedings are instituted, an effort shall be made to acquire the property involved by negotiation, unless, the effort to acquire such property by negotiation would, in the judgement of the Secretary be futile or so time-consuming as to unreasonably delay the development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, because of (1) reasonable doubt as to the identity of the owners, (2) the large number of persons with whom it would be necessary to negotiate, or (3) other reasons.
