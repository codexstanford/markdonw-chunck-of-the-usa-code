(1) Application

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), in the case of a biological product that would (but for this subsection) be an extended-monopoly drug (as defined in section 1320f–3(c)(4) of this title ) included as a selected drug on the list published under subsection (a) with respect to an initial price applicability year, the rules described in paragraph (2) shall apply if the Secretary determines that there is a high likelihood (as described in paragraph (3)) that a biosimilar biological product (for which such biological product will be the reference product) will be licensed and marketed under section 262(k) of this title before the date that is 2 years after the selected drug publication date with respect to such initial price applicability year.

(B) Request required

(i) In general

The Secretary shall not provide for a delay under

(I) paragraph (2)(A) unless a request is made for such a delay by a manufacturer of a biosimilar biological product prior to the selected drug publication date for the list published under subsection (a) with respect to the initial price applicability year for which the biological product may have been included as a selected drug on such list but for subparagraph (2)(A); or

(II) paragraph (2)(B)(iii) unless a request is made for such a delay by such a manufacturer prior to the selected drug publication date for the list published under subsection (a) with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 1 year after the initial price applicability year for which the biological product described in subsection (a) would have been included as a selected drug on such list but for paragraph (2)(A).

(ii) Information and documents

(I) In general

A request made under clause (i) shall be submitted to the Secretary by such manufacturer at a time and in a form and manner specified by the Secretary, and contain

(aa) information and documents necessary for the Secretary to make determinations under this subsection, as specified by the Secretary and including, to the extent available, items described in subclause (III); and

(bb) all agreements related to the biosimilar biological product filed with the Federal Trade Commission or the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to subsections (a) and (c) of section 1112 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.

The items described in this clause are the following:

(aa) The manufacturing schedule for such biosimilar biological product submitted to the Food and Drug Administration during its review of the application under such section 262(k) of this title .

(bb) Disclosures (in filings by the manufacturer of such biosimilar biological product with the Securities and Exchange Commission required under section 78 l (b), 78 l (g), 78m(a), or 78 o (d) of title 15 about capital investment, revenue expectations, and actions taken by the manufacturer that are typical of the normal course of business in the year (or the 2 years, as applicable) before marketing of a biosimilar biological product) that pertain to the marketing of such biosimilar biological product, or comparable documentation that is distributed to the shareholders of privately held companies.

(C) Aggregation rule

(i) In general

All persons treated as a single employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or in a partnership, shall be treated as one manufacturer for purposes of paragraph (2)(D)(iv).

(ii) Partnership defined

In clause (i), the term “partnership” means a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other organization through or by means of which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on by the manufacturer of the biological product and the manufacturer of the biosimilar biological product.

(2) Rules described

The rules described in this paragraph are the following:

(A) Delayed selection and negotiation for 1 year

If a determination of high likelihood is made under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall delay the inclusion of the biological product as a selected drug on the list published under subsection (a) until such list is published with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 1 year after the initial price applicability year for which the biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list.

(B) If not licensed and marketed during the initial delay

(i) In general

If, during the time period between the selected drug publication date on which the biological product would have been included on the list as a selected drug pursuant to subsection (a) but for subparagraph (A) and the selected drug publication date with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 1 year after the initial price applicability year for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list, the Secretary determines that the biosimilar biological product for which the manufacturer submitted the request under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(II) (and for which the Secretary previously made a high likelihood determination under paragraph (3)) has not been licensed and marketed under section 262(k) of this title , the Secretary shall, at the request of such manufacturer

(I) reevaluate whether there is a high likelihood (as described in paragraph (3)) that such biosimilar biological product will be licensed and marketed under such section 262(k) before the date that is 2 years after the selected drug publication date for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list published but for subparagraph (A); and

(II) evaluate whether, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, the manufacturer of such biosimilar biological product has made a significant amount of progress (as determined by the Secretary) towards both such licensure and the marketing of such biosimilar biological product (based on information from items described in subclauses (I)(bb) and (II) of paragraph (1)(B)(ii)) since the receipt by the Secretary of the request made by such manufacturer under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I).

(ii) Selection and negotiation

If the Secretary determines that there is not a high likelihood that such biosimilar biological product will be licensed and marketed as described in clause (i)(I) or there has not been a significant amount of progress as described in clause (i)(II)

(I) the Secretary shall include the biological product as a selected drug on the list published under subsection (a) with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 1 year after the initial price applicability year for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list but for subparagraph (A); and

(II) the manufacturer of such biological product shall pay a rebate under paragraph (4) with respect to the year for which such manufacturer would have provided access to a maximum fair price for such biological product but for subparagraph (A).

(iii) Second 1-year delay

If the Secretary determines that there is a high likelihood that such biosimilar biological product will be licensed and marketed (as described in clause (i)(I)) and a significant amount of progress has been made by the manufacturer of such biosimilar biological product towards such licensure and marketing (as described in clause (i)(II)), the Secretary shall delay the inclusion of the biological product as a selected drug on the list published under subsection (a) until the selected drug publication date of such list with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 2 years after the initial price applicability year for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list but for this subsection.

(C) If not licensed and marketed during the year two delay

If, during the time period between the selected drug publication date of the list for which the biological product would have been included as a selected drug but for subparagraph (B)(iii) and the selected drug publication date with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 2 years after the initial price applicability year for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list but for this subsection, the Secretary determines that such biosimilar biological product has not been licensed and marketed

(i) the Secretary shall include such biological product as a selected drug on such list with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 2 years after the initial price applicability year for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list; and

(ii) the manufacturer of such biological product shall pay a rebate under paragraph (4) with respect to the years for which such manufacturer would have provided access to a maximum fair price for such biological product but for this subsection.

(D) Limitations on delays

(i) Limited to 2 years

In no case shall the Secretary delay the inclusion of a biological product on the list published under subsection (a) for more than 2 years.

(ii) Exclusion of biological products that transitioned to a long-monopoly drug during the delay

In the case of a biological product for which the inclusion on the list published pursuant to subsection (a) was delayed by 1 year under subparagraph (A) and for which there would have been a change in status to a long-monopoly drug (as defined in section 1320f–3(c)(5) of this title ) if such biological product had been a selected drug, in no case may the Secretary provide for a second 1-year delay under subparagraph (B)(iii).

(iii) Exclusion of biological products if more than 1 year since licensure

In no case shall the Secretary delay the inclusion of a biological product on the list published under subsection (a) if more than 1 year has elapsed since the biosimilar biological product has been licensed under section 262(k) of this title and marketing has not commenced for such biosimilar biological product.

(iv) Certain manufacturers of biosimilar biological products excluded

In no case shall the Secretary delay the inclusion of a biological product as a selected drug on the list published under subsection (a) if Secretary determined that the manufacturer of the biosimilar biological product described in paragraph (1)(A)

(I) is the same as the manufacturer of the reference product described in such paragraph or is treated as being the same pursuant to paragraph (1)(C); or

(II) has, based on information from items described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii)(I)(bb), entered into any agreement described in such paragraph with the manufacturer of the reference product described in paragraph (1)(A) that

(aa) requires or incentivizes the manufacturer of the biosimilar biological product to submit a request described in paragraph (1)(B); or

(bb) restricts the quantity (either directly or indirectly) of the biosimilar biological product that may be sold in the United States over a specified period of time.

(3) High likelihood

For purposes of this subsection, there is a high likelihood described in paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), as applicable, if the Secretary finds that

(A) an application for licensure under section 262(k) of this title for the biosimilar biological product has been accepted for review or approved by the Food and Drug Administration; and

(B) information from items described in sub clauses  2 (I)(bb) and (III) of paragraph (1)(B)(ii) submitted to the Secretary by the manufacturer requesting a delay under such paragraph provides clear and convincing evidence that such biosimilar biological product will, within the time period specified under paragraph (1)(A) or (2)(B)(i)(I), be marketed.

(4) Rebate

(A) In general

For purposes of subparagraphs (B)(ii)(II) and (C)(ii) of paragraph (2), in the case of a biological product for which the inclusion on the list under subsection (a) was delayed under this subsection and for which the Secretary has negotiated and entered into an agreement under section 1320f–2 of this title with respect to such biological product, the manufacturer shall be required to pay a rebate to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as determined by the Secretary.

(BB) paragraph (2)(B)(iii), such maximum fair price, increased as described in section 1320f–4(b)(1)(A) of this title ; and

(II) the number of units dispensed under part D of subchapter XVIII for such covered part D drug during each such calendar quarter of such price applicability period; and

(ii) in the case of a biological product for which payment may be made under part B of subchapter XVIII, that is the sum of the products of

(I) 80 percent of the amount by which

(aa) the payment amount for such biological product under section 1395w–3a(b) of this title , with respect to each of the calendar quarters of the price applicability period that would have applied but for this subsection; exceeds

(bb) in the initial price applicability year that would have applied but for a delay under

(AA) paragraph (2)(A), the maximum fair price negotiated under section 1320f–3 of this title for such biological product under such agreement; or
