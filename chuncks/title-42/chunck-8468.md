Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, a State may provide through a State plan amendment for the provision of medical assistance for home and community-based services (within the scope of services described in paragraph (4)(B) of subsection (c) for which the Secretary has the authority to approve a waiver and not including room and board) for individuals eligible for medical assistance under the State plan whose income does not exceed 150 percent of the poverty line (as defined in section 1397jj(c)(5) of this title ), without determining that but for the provision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, but only if the State meets the following requirements:

(A) Needs-based criteria for eligibility for, and receipt of, home and community-based services

(B) Establishment of more stringent needs-based eligibility criteria for institutionalized care

The State establishes needs-based criteria for determining whether an individual requires the level of care provided in a hospital, a nursing facility, or an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded under the State plan or under any waiver of such plan that are more stringent than the needs-based criteria established under subparagraph (A) for determining eligibility for home and community-based services.

(C) Projection of number of individuals to be provided home and community-based services

The State submits to the Secretary, in such form and manner, and upon such frequency as the Secretary shall specify, the projected number of individuals to be provided home and community-based services.

(D) Criteria based on individual assessment

(i) In general

(ii) Adjustment authority

The State plan amendment provides the State with the option to modify the criteria established under subparagraph (A) (without having to obtain prior approval from the Secretary) in the event that the enrollment of individuals eligible for home and community-based services exceeds the projected enrollment submitted for purposes of subparagraph (C), but only if

(I) the State provides at least 60 days notice to the Secretary and the public of the proposed modification;

(II) the State deems an individual receiving home and community-based services on the basis of the most recent version of the criteria in effect prior to the effective date of the modification to continue to be eligible for such services after the effective date of the modification and until such time as the individual no longer meets the standard for receipt of such services under such pre-modified criteria; and

(III) after the effective date of such modification, the State, at a minimum, applies the criteria for determining whether an individual requires the level of care provided in a hospital, a nursing facility, or an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded under the State plan or under any waiver of such plan which applied prior to the application of the more stringent criteria developed under subparagraph (B).

(ii) A face-to-face evaluation of the individual by an individual trained in the assessment and evaluation of individuals whose physical or mental conditions trigger a potential need for home and community-based services.

(iii) Where appropriate, consultation with the individual’s family, spouse, guardian, or other responsible individual.

(iv) Consultation with appropriate treating and consulting health and support professionals caring for the individual.

(v) An examination of the individual’s relevant history, medical records, and care and support needs, guided by best practices and research on effective strategies that result in improved health and quality of life outcomes.
