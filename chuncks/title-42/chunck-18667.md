#### § 10366. Climate change and water intragovernmental panel
##### (c) Review elements

In conducting the review and developing the strategy under subsection (a), the panel shall consult with State water resource agencies, the Advisory Committee, drinking water utilities, water research organizations, and relevant water user, environmental, and other nongovernmental organizations

(1) to assess the extent to which the conduct of measures of streamflow, groundwater levels, soil moisture, evapotranspiration rates, evaporation rates, snowpack levels, precipitation amounts, flood risk, and glacier mass is necessary to improve the understanding of the Federal Government and the States with respect to each impact of global climate change on water resources;

(2) to identify data gaps in current water monitoring networks that must be addressed to improve the capability of the Federal Government and the States to measure, analyze, and predict changes to the quality and quantity of water resources, including flood risks, that are directly or indirectly affected by global climate change;

(3) to establish data management and communication protocols and standards to increase the quality and efficiency by which each Federal agency acquires and reports relevant data;

(4) to consider options for the establishment of a data portal to enhance access to water resource data

(A) relating to each nationally significant freshwater watershed and aquifer located in the United States; and

(B) that is collected by each Federal agency and any other public or private entity for each nationally significant freshwater watershed and aquifer located in the United States;

(5) to facilitate the development of hydrologic and other models to integrate data that reflects groundwater and surface water interactions; and

(6) to apply the hydrologic and other models developed under paragraph (5) to water resource management problems identified by the panel, including the need to maintain or improve ecological resiliency at watershed and aquifer system scales.
