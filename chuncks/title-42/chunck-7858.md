##### (e) Payments

(1) Per applicable beneficiary per month care management fee

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish a schedule of per applicable beneficiary per month care management fees. Such a per applicable beneficiary per month care management fee shall be paid to a participant in addition to any other amount otherwise payable under this subchapter to the health care practitioners in the participant’s opioid use disorder care team or, if applicable, to the participant. A participant may use such per applicable beneficiary per month care management fee to deliver additional services to applicable beneficiaries, including services not otherwise eligible for payment under this subchapter.

(B) Payment amounts

In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary may

(i) consider payments otherwise payable under this subchapter for opioid use disorder treatment services and the needs of applicable beneficiaries;

(ii) pay a higher per applicable beneficiary per month care management fee for an applicable beneficiary who receives more intensive treatment services from a participant and for whom those services are appropriate based on clinical guidelines for opioid use disorder care;

(iii) pay a higher per applicable beneficiary per month care management fee for the month in which the applicable beneficiary begins treatment with a participant than in subsequent months, to reflect the greater time and costs required for the planning and initiation of treatment, as compared to maintenance of treatment; and

(iv) take into account whether a participant’s opioid use disorder care team refers applicable beneficiaries to other suppliers or providers for any opioid use disorder treatment services.

(C) No duplicate payment

The Secretary shall make payments under this paragraph to only one participant for services furnished to an applicable beneficiary during a calendar month.

(2) Incentive payments
