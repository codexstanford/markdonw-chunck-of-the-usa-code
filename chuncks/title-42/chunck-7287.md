### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395m. Special payment rules for particular items and services
##### (l) Establishment of fee schedule for ambulance services

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish a fee schedule for payment for ambulance services whether provided directly by a supplier or provider or under arrangement with a provider under this part through a negotiated rulemaking process described in title 5 and in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.

(2) Considerations

In establishing such fee schedule, the Secretary shall

(A) establish mechanisms to control increases in expenditures for ambulance services under this part;

(B) establish definitions for ambulance services which link payments to the type of services provided;

(C) consider appropriate regional and operational differences;

(D) consider adjustments to payment rates to account for inflation and other relevant factors; and

(E) phase in the application of the payment rates under the fee schedule in an efficient and fair manner consistent with paragraph (11), except that such phase-in shall provide for full payment of any national mileage rate for ambulance services provided by suppliers that are paid by carriers in any of the 50 States where payment by a carrier for such services for all such suppliers in such State did not, prior to the implementation of the fee schedule, include a separate amount for all mileage within the county from which the beneficiary is transported.

(3) Savings

In establishing such fee schedule, the Secretary shall

(A) ensure that the aggregate amount of payments made for ambulance services under this part during 2000 does not exceed the aggregate amount of payments which would have been made for such services under this part during such year if the amendments made by section 4531(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 continued in effect, except that in making such determination the Secretary shall assume an update in such payments for 2002 equal to percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) for the 12-month period ending with June of the previous year reduced in the case of 2002 by 1.0 percentage points;

(B) set the payment amounts provided under the fee schedule for services furnished in 2001 and each subsequent year at amounts equal to the payment amounts under the fee schedule for services furnished during the previous year, increased, subject to subparagraph (C) and the succeeding sentence of this paragraph, by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) for the 12-month period ending with June of the previous year reduced in the case of 2002 by 1.0 percentage points; and

(C) for 2011 and each subsequent year, after determining the percentage increase under subparagraph (B) for the year, reduce such percentage increase by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title . The application of subparagraph (C) may result in the percentage increase under subparagraph (B) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the fee schedule under this subsection for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

(4) Consultation

In establishing the fee schedule for ambulance services under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with various national organizations representing individuals and entities who furnish and regulate ambulance services and share with such organizations relevant data in establishing such schedule.

(5) Limitation on review

There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title or otherwise of the amounts established under the fee schedule for ambulance services under this subsection, including matters described in paragraph (2).

(6) Restraint on billing

The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1395u(b)(18) of this title shall apply to ambulance services for which payment is made under this subsection in the same manner as they apply to services provided by a practitioner described in section 1395u(b)(18)(C) of this title .

(7) Coding system

The Secretary may require the claim for any services for which the amount of payment is determined under this subsection to include a code (or codes) under a uniform coding system specified by the Secretary that identifies the services furnished.

(8) Services furnished by critical access hospitals

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Secretary shall pay 101 percent of the reasonable costs incurred in furnishing ambulance services if such services are furnished

(A) by a critical access hospital (as defined in section 1395x(mm)(1) of this title ), or

(B) by an entity that is owned and operated by a critical access hospital, but only if the critical access hospital or entity is the only provider or supplier of ambulance services that is located within a 35-mile drive of such critical access hospital.

(9) Transitional assistance for rural providers

In the case of ground ambulance services furnished on or after July 1, 2001 , and before January 1, 2004 , for which the transportation originates in a rural area (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title ) or in a rural census tract of a metropolitan statistical area (as determined under the most recent modification of the Goldsmith Modification, originally published in the Federal Register on February 27, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 6725)), the fee schedule established under this subsection shall provide that, with respect to the payment rate for mileage for a trip above 17 miles, and up to 50 miles, the rate otherwise established shall be increased by not less than ½ of the additional payment per mile established for the first 17 miles of such a trip originating in a rural area.

(10) Phase-in providing floor using blend of fee schedule and regional fee schedules

In carrying out the phase-in under paragraph (2)(E) for each level of ground service furnished in a year, the portion of the payment amount that is based on the fee schedule shall be the greater of the amount determined under such fee schedule (without regard to this paragraph) or the following blended rate of the fee schedule under paragraph (1) and of a regional fee schedule for the region involved:

(A) For 2004 (for services furnished on or after July 1, 2004 ), the blended rate shall be based 20 percent on the fee schedule under paragraph (1) and 80 percent on the regional fee schedule.

(B) For 2005, the blended rate shall be based 40 percent on the fee schedule under paragraph (1) and 60 percent on the regional fee schedule.

(D) For 2007, 2008, and 2009, the blended rate shall be based 80 percent on the fee schedule under paragraph (1) and 20 percent on the regional fee schedule.

(E) For 2010 and each succeeding year, the blended rate shall be based 100 percent on the fee schedule under paragraph (1). For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall establish a regional fee schedule for each of the nine census divisions (referred to in section 1395ww(d)(2) of this title ) using the methodology (used in establishing the fee schedule under paragraph (1)) to calculate a regional conversion factor and a regional mileage payment rate and using the same payment adjustments and the same relative value units as used in the fee schedule under such paragraph.

(11) Adjustment in payment for certain long trips

In the case of ground ambulance services furnished on or after July 1, 2004 , and before January 1, 2009 , regardless of where the transportation originates, the fee schedule established under this subsection shall provide that, with respect to the payment rate for mileage for a trip above 50 miles the per mile rate otherwise established shall be increased by ¼ of the payment per mile otherwise applicable to miles in excess of 50 miles in such trip.
