######## (A) In the case of a bill or request for payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment may otherwise be made under this part on an assignment-related basis or under a provider agreement under section 1395cc of this title , payment may be made only to the person or entity which performed or supervised the performance of such test; except that

(i) if a physician performed or supervised the performance of such test, payment may be made to another physician with whom he shares his practice,

(ii) in the case of a test performed at the request of a laboratory by another laboratory, payment may be made to the referring laboratory but only if

(I) the referring laboratory is located in, or is part of, a rural hospital,

(II) the referring laboratory is wholly owned by the entity performing such test, the referring laboratory wholly owns the entity performing such test, or both the referring laboratory and the entity performing such test are wholly-owned by a third entity, or

(III) not more than 30 percent of the clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for which such referring laboratory (but not including a laboratory described in subclause (II)), 7 receives requests for testing during the year in which the test is performed  7 are performed by another laboratory, and

(iii) in the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test provided under an arrangement (as defined in section 1395x(w)(1) of this title ) made by a hospital, critical access hospital, or skilled nursing facility, payment shall be made to the hospital or skilled nursing facility.

(B) In the case of such a bill or request for payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment may otherwise be made under this part, and which is not described in subparagraph (A), payment may be made to the beneficiary only on the basis of the itemized bill of the person or entity which performed or supervised the performance of the test.

(C) Payment for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test, including a test performed in a physician’s office but excluding a test performed by a rural health clinic may only be made on an assignment-related basis or to a provider of services with an agreement in effect under section 1395cc of this title .

(D) A person may not bill for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test, including a test performed in a physician’s office but excluding a test performed by a rural health clinic, other than on an assignment-related basis. If a person knowingly and willfully and on a repeated basis bills for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test in violation of the previous sentence, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the person in the same manner as the Secretary may apply sanctions against a physician in accordance with paragraph (2) of section 1395u(j) of this title in the same manner such paragraphs apply  8 with respect to a physician. Paragraph (4) of such section shall apply in this subparagraph in the same manner as such paragraph applies to such section.

(6) For tests furnished before January 1, 2017 , in the case of any diagnostic laboratory test payment for which is not made on the basis of a fee schedule under paragraph (1), the Secretary may establish a payment rate which is acceptable to the person or entity performing the test and which would be considered the full charge for such tests. Such negotiated rate shall be limited to an amount not in excess of the total payment that would have been made for the services in the absence of such rate.

(7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4) and section 1395m–1 of this title , the Secretary shall establish a national minimum payment amount under this part for a diagnostic or screening pap smear laboratory test (including all cervical cancer screening technologies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a primary screening method for detection of cervical cancer) equal to $14.60 for tests furnished in 2000. For such tests furnished in subsequent years, such national minimum payment amount shall be adjusted annually as provided in paragraph (2).

(A) The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for determining the basis for, and amount of, payment under this subsection for any clinical diagnostic laboratory test with respect to which a new or substantially revised HCPCS code is assigned on or after January 1, 2005 (in this paragraph referred to as “new tests”).
