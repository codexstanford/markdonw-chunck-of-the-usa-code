### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395u. Provisions relating to the administration of part B
##### (b) Determination of reasonable charges
######## (A) In the case of physicians’ services furnished to a patient in a hospital with a teaching program approved as specified in section 1395x(b)(6) of this title but which does not meet the conditions described in section 1395x(b)(7) of this title , the Secretary shall not provide (except on the basis described in subparagraph (C)) for payment for such services under this part
######### (i) The Secretary shall by regulation

(I) describe the factors to be used in determining the cases (of particular items or services) in which the application of this subchapter to payment under this part (other than to physicians’ services paid under section 1395w–4 of this title ) results in the determination of an amount that, because of its being grossly excessive or grossly deficient, is not inherently reasonable, and

(II) provide in those cases for the factors to be considered in determining an amount that is realistic and equitable.

(ii) Notwithstanding the determination made in clause (i), the Secretary may not apply factors that would increase or decrease the payment under this part during any year for any particular item or service by more than 15 percent from such payment during the preceding year except as provided in subparagraph (B).
