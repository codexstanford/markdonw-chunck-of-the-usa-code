#### § 19133. Initiative coordination
##### (a) Interagency committee

The President, acting through the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall designate an interagency committee to coordinate activities of the Initiative as appropriate, which shall be co-chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall select an additional co-chairperson from among the members of the interagency committee. The interagency committee shall oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Initiative. The interagency committee shall carry out the following:

(1) Provide for interagency coordination of Federal engineering biology research, development, and other activities undertaken pursuant to the Initiative.

(2) Establish and periodically update goals and priorities for the Initiative.

(3) Develop, not later than 12 months after August 9, 2022 , and update every five years thereafter, a strategic plan submitted to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, the Committee on Agriculture, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate that

(A) guides the activities of the Initiative for purposes of meeting the goals and priorities established under (and updated pursuant to) paragraph (2); and

(B) describes

(i) the Initiative’s support for long-term funding for interdisciplinary engineering biology research and development;

(ii) the Initiative’s support for education and public outreach activities;

(iii) the Initiative’s support for research and other activities on ethical, legal, environmental, safety, security, and other appropriate societal issues related to engineering biology, including

(I) an applied biorisk management research plan;

(II) recommendations for integrating security into biological data access and international reciprocity agreements;

(III) recommendations for manufacturing restructuring to support engineering biology research, development, and scaling-up initiatives; and

(IV) an evaluation of existing biosecurity governance policies, guidance, and directives for the purposes of creating an adaptable, evidence-based framework to respond to emerging biosecurity challenges created by advances in engineering biology;

(iv) how the Initiative will contribute to moving results out of the laboratory and into application for the benefit of society and United States competitiveness; and

(v) how the Initiative will measure and track the contributions of engineering biology to United States economic growth and other societal indicators.

(4) Develop a national genomic sequencing strategy to ensure engineering biology research fully leverages plant, animal, and microbe biodiversity, as appropriate and in a manner that does not compromise economic competitiveness, national security, or the privacy or security of human genetic information, to enhance long-term innovation and competitiveness in engineering biology in the United States.

(5) Develop a plan to utilize Federal programs, such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (as described in section 638 of title 15 ), in support of the activities described in section 19132(b)(3) of this title .

(6) In carrying out this section, take into consideration the recommendations of the advisory committee established under section 19134 of this title , the results of the workshop convened under section 19132 of this title , existing reports on related topics, and the views of academic, State, industry, and other appropriate groups.
