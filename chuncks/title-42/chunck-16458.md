The sulfur content and cetane index minimum of fuel required to be used in the certification of 1994 and later model year heavy-duty diesel vehicles and engines shall comply with the regulations promulgated under paragraph (2).

(4) The States of Alaska and Hawaii may be exempted from the requirements of this subsection in the same manner as provided in section 7625  4 of this title. The Administrator shall take final action on any petition filed under section 7625  4 of this title or this paragraph for an exemption from the requirements of this subsection, within 12 months from the date of the petition.
