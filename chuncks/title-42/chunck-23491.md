(III) estimate the energy and cost savings potential of the opportunities identified in subclause (II) using software approved by the Secretary;

(IV) identify

(aa) the period and level of peak energy demand for each building within the facility of the eligible recipient; and

(bb) the sources of energy consumption that are contributing the most to that period of peak energy demand;

(V) recommend controls and management systems to reduce or redistribute peak energy consumption; and

(VI) estimate the total energy and cost savings potential for the facility of the eligible recipient if all recommended upgrades and retrofits are implemented, using software approved by the Secretary.

(iii) Additional audit inclusions

A commercial energy audit conducted using a loan provided under clause (i) may recommend strategies to increase energy efficiency of the facility of the eligible recipient through use of electric systems or other high-efficiency systems utilizing fuels, including natural gas and hydrogen.

(II) recommend lifecycle cost-effective opportunities to reduce energy consumption within the residential building of the eligible recipient, including through energy efficient

(aa) lighting;

(bb) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems;

(cc) windows;

(dd) appliances; and

(ee) insulation and building envelopes;

(IV) compare the energy consumption of the residential building of the eligible recipient to comparable residential buildings in the same geographic area; and

(V) provide a Home Energy Score, or equivalent score (as determined by the Secretary), for the residential building of the eligible recipient by using the Home Energy Score Tool of the Department or an equivalent scoring tool.

(iii) Additional audit inclusions

A residential energy audit conducted using a loan provided under clause (i) may recommend strategies to increase energy efficiency of the facility of the eligible recipient through use of electric systems or other high-efficiency systems utilizing fuels, including natural gas and hydrogen.
