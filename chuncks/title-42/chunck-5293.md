(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii):

(I) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the WTC Program Administrator shall reimburse costs for medically necessary treatment under this subchapter for WTC-related health conditions according to the payment rates that would apply to the provision of such treatment and services by the facility under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.

(II) For treatment not covered under subclause (i) or subparagraph (B), the WTC Program Administrator shall establish by regulation a reimbursement rate for such treatment.

(ii) Exception

In no case shall payments for products or services under clause (i) be made at a rate higher than the Office of Worker’s Compensation Programs in the Department  1 Labor would pay for such products or services rendered at the time such products or services were provided.

(B) Pharmaceuticals

(i) In general

The WTC Program Administrator shall establish a program for paying for the medically necessary outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals prescribed under this subchapter for WTC-related health conditions through one or more contracts with outside vendors.

(ii) Competitive bidding

Under such program the Administrator shall

(iii) Treatment of FDNY participants

Under such program the Administrator may enter into an agreement with a separate vendor to provide pharmaceutical benefits to enrolled WTC responders for whom the Clinical Center of Excellence is described in section 300mm—4 of this title if such an arrangement is deemed necessary and beneficial to the program by the WTC Program Administrator.

(iv) Pharmaceuticals

Not later than July 1, 2011 , the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate a report on whether existing Federal pharmaceutical purchasing programs can provide pharmaceutical benefits more efficiently and effectively than through the WTC program.

(C) Improving quality and efficiency through modification of payment amounts and methodologies

The WTC Program Administrator may modify the amounts and methodologies for making payments for initial health evaluations, monitoring, or treatment, if, taking into account utilization and quality data furnished by the Clinical Centers of Excellence under section 300mm–4(b)(1)(B)(iii) of this title , the Administrator determines that a bundling, capitation, pay for performance, or other payment methodology would better ensure high quality and efficient delivery of initial health evaluations, monitoring, or treatment to an enrolled WTC responder, screening-eligible WTC survivor, or certified-eligible WTC survivor.
