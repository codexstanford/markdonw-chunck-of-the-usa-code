#### § 16157. Demonstration
##### (a) In general

In carrying out the programs under this section, the Secretary shall fund a limited number of demonstration projects, consistent with this subchapter and a determination of the maturity, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impacts of technologies supporting each project. In selecting projects under this subsection, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable and in the public interest, select projects that

(1) involve using hydrogen and related products at existing facilities or installations, such as existing office buildings, military bases, vehicle fleet centers, transit bus authorities, or units of the National Park System;

(2) depend on reliable power from hydrogen to carry out essential activities;

(3) lead to the replication of hydrogen technologies and draw such technologies into the marketplace;

(4) include vehicle, portable, and stationary demonstrations of fuel cell and hydrogen-based energy technologies;

(5) address the interdependency of demand for hydrogen fuel cell applications and hydrogen fuel infrastructure;

(6) raise awareness of hydrogen technology among the public;

(7) facilitate identification of an optimum technology among competing alternatives;

(8) address distributed generation using renewable sources;

(9) carry out demonstrations of evolving hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in national parks, remote island areas, and on Indian tribal land, as selected by the Secretary;

(10) carry out a program to demonstrate developmental hydrogen and fuel cell systems for mobile, portable, and stationary uses, using improved versions of the learning demonstrations program concept of the Department including demonstrations involving

(A) light-duty vehicles;

(B) heavy-duty vehicles;

(C) fleet vehicles;

(D) specialty industrial and farm vehicles; and

(E) commercial and residential portable, continuous, and backup electric power generation;

(11) in accordance with any code or standards developed in a region, fund prototype, pilot fleet, and infrastructure regional hydrogen supply corridors along the interstate highway system in varied climates across the United States; and

(12) fund demonstration programs that explore the use of hydrogen blends, hybrid hydrogen, and hydrogen reformed from renewable agricultural fuels, including the use of hydrogen in hybrid electric, heavier duty, and advanced internal combustion-powered vehicles. The Secretary shall give preference to projects which address multiple elements contained in paragraphs (1) through (12).
