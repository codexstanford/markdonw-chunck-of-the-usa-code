##### (f) Threshold for reporting

(1) Toxic chemical threshold amount

The threshold amounts for purposes of reporting toxic chemicals under this section are as follows:

(B) With respect to a toxic chemical manufactured or processed at a facility

(i) For the toxic chemical release form required to be submitted under this section on or before July 1, 1988 , 75,000 pounds of the toxic chemical per year.

(ii) For the form required to be submitted on or before July 1, 1989 , 50,000 pounds of the toxic chemical per year.

(iii) For the form required to be submitted on or before July 1, 1990 , and for each form thereafter, 25,000 pounds of the toxic chemical per year.

(2) Revisions

The Administrator may establish a threshold amount for a toxic chemical different from the amount established by paragraph (1). Such revised threshold shall obtain reporting on a substantial majority of total releases of the chemical at all facilities subject to the requirements of this section. The amounts established under this paragraph may, at the Administrator’s discretion, be based on classes of chemicals or categories of facilities.
