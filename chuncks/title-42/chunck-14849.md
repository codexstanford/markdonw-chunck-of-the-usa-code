#### § 6604. Interagency working group on research regulation
##### (c) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) administrative burdens faced by researchers may be reducing the return on investment of federally funded research and development; and

(2) it is a matter of critical importance to United States competitiveness that administrative costs of federally funded research be streamlined so that a higher proportion of federal funding is applied to direct research activities.
