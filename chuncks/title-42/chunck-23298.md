##### (e) Low-dose radiation research program

(1) In general

The Secretary shall carry out a research program on low-dose and low dose-rate radiation to

(A) enhance the scientific understanding of, and reduce uncertainties associated with, the effects of exposure to low-dose and low dose-rate radiation; and

(B) inform improved risk-assessment and risk-management methods with respect to such radiation.

(2) Program components

In carrying out the program required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) support and carry out the directives under section 106(b) of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act ( 42 U.S.C. 6601 note), except that such section shall be treated for purposes of this subsection as applying to low dose and low-dose rate radiation research, in coordination with the Physical Science Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council;

(B) identify and, to the extent possible, quantify, potential monetary and health-related impacts to Federal agencies, the general public, industry, research communities, and other users of information produced by such research program;

(C) leverage the collective body of knowledge from existing low-dose and low dose-rate radiation research;

(D) engage with other Federal agencies, research communities, and potential users of information produced under this section, including institutions performing or utilizing radiation research, medical physics, radiology, health physics, and emergency response measures; and

(E) support education and outreach activities to disseminate information and promote public understanding of low-dose radiation, with a focus on non-emergency situations such as medical physics, space exploration, and naturally occurring radiation.

(3) Research plan

(A) Not later than 90 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to develop a long-term strategic and prioritized research agenda for the program described in paragraph (2);

(B) Not later than one year after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall transmit this research plan developed in subparagraph (A) to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.

(4) GAO study

Not later than 3 years after December 27, 2020 , the Comptroller General shall transmit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, a report on:

(A) an evaluation of the program activities carried out under this section;

(B) the effectiveness of the coordination and management of the program; and

(C) the implementation of the research plan outlined in paragraph (3).

(5) Definitions

In this subsection:

(A) Low-dose radiation

The term “low-dose radiation” means a radiation dose of less than 100 millisieverts.

(B) Low dose-rate radiation

The term “low dose-rate radiation” means a radiation dose rate of less than 5 millisieverts per hour.

(6) Rule of construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to subject any research carried out by the Secretary for the program under this subsection to any limitations described in section 16317(e) of this title .

(7) Funding

For purposes of carrying out this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to make available from funds provided to the Biological and Environmental Research Program

(A) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2021;

(B) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2022;

(C) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2023;

(D) $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2024;

(E) $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2025;

(F) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2026; and

(G) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027.
