### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395f. Conditions of and limitations on payment for services
##### (l) Payment for inpatient critical access hospital services

(1) Except as provided in the subsequent paragraphs of this subsection, the amount of payment under this part for inpatient critical access hospital services is equal to 101 percent of the reasonable costs of the critical access hospital in providing such services.

(2) In the case of a distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit of a critical access hospital described in section 1395i–4(c)(2)(E) of this title , the amount of payment for inpatient critical access hospital services of such unit shall be equal to the amount of the payment that would otherwise be made if such services were inpatient hospital services of a distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit, respectively, described in the matter following clause (v)  3 of section 1395ww(d)(1)(B) of this title .

(3)

(A) The following rules shall apply in determining payment and reasonable costs under paragraph (1) for costs described in subparagraph (C) for a critical access hospital that would be a meaningful EHR user (as would be determined under paragraph (3) of section 1395ww(n) of this title ) for an EHR reporting period for a cost reporting period beginning during a payment year if such critical access hospital was treated as an eligible hospital under such section:

(i) The Secretary shall compute reasonable costs by expensing such costs in a single payment year and not depreciating such costs over a period of years (and shall include as costs with respect to cost reporting periods beginning during a payment year costs from previous cost reporting periods to the extent they have not been fully depreciated as of the period involved).

(ii) There shall be substituted for the Medicare share that would otherwise be applied under paragraph (1) a percent (not to exceed 100 percent) equal to the sum of

(I) the Medicare share (as would be specified under paragraph (2)(D) of section 1395ww(n) of this title ) for such critical access hospital if such critical access hospital was treated as an eligible hospital under such section; and

(II) 20 percentage points.

(B) The payment under this paragraph with respect to a critical access hospital shall be paid through a prompt interim payment (subject to reconciliation) after submission and review of such information (as specified by the Secretary) necessary to make such payment, including information necessary to apply this paragraph. In no case may payment under this paragraph be made with respect to a cost reporting period beginning during a payment year after 2015 and in no case may a critical access hospital receive payment under this paragraph with respect to more than 4 consecutive payment years.

(C) The costs described in this subparagraph are costs for the purchase of certified EHR technology to which purchase depreciation (excluding interest) would apply if payment was made under paragraph (1) and not under this paragraph.

(D) For purposes of this paragraph, paragraph (4), and paragraph (5), the terms “certified EHR technology”, “eligible hospital”, “EHR reporting period”, and “payment year” have the meanings given such terms in sections 1395ww(n) of this title.

(4)

(A) Subject to subparagraph (C), for cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2015 or a subsequent fiscal year, in the case of a critical access hospital that is not a meaningful EHR user (as would be determined under paragraph (3) of section 1395ww(n) of this title if such critical access hospital was treated as an eligible hospital under such section) for an EHR reporting period with respect to such fiscal year, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting the applicable percent under subparagraph (B) for the percent described in such paragraph (1).
