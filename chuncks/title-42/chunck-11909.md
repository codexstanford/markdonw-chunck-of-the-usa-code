(i) the State will be unable to fully and effectively administer its State plan and to carry out programs and projects authorized by this subchapter unless such additional amounts are made available by the Assistant Secretary;

(ii) the State is making full and effective use of its allotment under paragraph (1) and of the personnel of the State agency and area agencies designated under section 3025(a)(2)(A) of this title in the administration of its State plan in accordance with subsection (a); and

(iii) the State agency and area agencies on aging of such State are carrying out, on a full-time basis, programs and activities which are in furtherance of the objectives of this chapter.

(D) Amounts which any State may receive in any fiscal year under this paragraph may not exceed three-fourths of 1 percent of the sum of the amounts allotted under section 3024(a) of this title to such State to carry out the State plan for such fiscal year.

(E) No application by a State under subparagraph (A) shall be approved unless it contains assurances that no amounts received by the State under this paragraph will be used to hire any individual to fill a job opening created by the action of the State in laying off or terminating the employment of any regular employee not supported under this chapter in anticipation of filling the vacancy so created by hiring an employee to be supported through use of amounts received under this paragraph.
