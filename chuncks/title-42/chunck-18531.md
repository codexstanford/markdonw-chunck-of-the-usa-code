### CHAPTER 108— NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY
#### § 10197. Research and development on disposal of high-level radioactive waste
##### (a) Purpose

Not later than 64 months after January 7, 1983 , the Secretary is authorized to, to the extent practicable, begin at a site evaluated under section 10194 of this title , as part of and as an extension of siting research activities of such site under such section, the mining and construction of a test and evaluation facility. Prior to the mining and construction of such facility, the Secretary shall prepare an environmental assessment. The purpose of such facility shall be

(1) to supplement and focus the repository site characterization process;

(2) to provide the conditions under which known technological components can be integrated to demonstrate a functioning repository-like system;

(3) to provide a means of identifying, evaluating, and resolving potential repository licensing issues that could not be resolved during the siting research program conducted under section 10192  1 of this title;

(4) to validate, under actual conditions, the scientific models used in the design of a repository;

(5) to refine the design and engineering of repository components and systems and to confirm the predicted behavior of such components and systems;

(6) to supplement the siting data, the generic and specific geological characteristics developed under section 10194 of this title relating to isolating disposal materials in the physical environment of a repository;

(7) to evaluate the design concepts for packaging, handling, and emplacement of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel at the design rate; and

(8) to establish operating capability without exposing workers to excessive radiation.
