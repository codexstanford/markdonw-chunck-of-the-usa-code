#### § 299c–6. Funding
##### (a) Intent

To ensure that the United States investment in biomedical research is rapidly translated into improvements in the quality of patient care, there must be a corresponding investment in research on the most effective clinical and organizational strategies for use of these findings in daily practice. The authorization levels in subsections (b) and (c) provide for a proportionate increase in health care research as the United States investment in biomedical research increases.
