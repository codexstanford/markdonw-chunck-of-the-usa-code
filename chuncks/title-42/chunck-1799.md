### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 285a–11. Pediatric cancer research, awareness, and survivorship
##### (a) Children’s cancer biorepositories

(1) Award

The Secretary, acting through the Director of NIH, may make awards to an entity or entities described in paragraph (4) to build upon existing research efforts to collect biospecimens and clinical and demographic information of children, adolescents, and young adults with selected cancer subtypes (and their recurrences) for which current treatments are least effective, in order to achieve a better understanding of the causes of such cancer subtypes (and their recurrences), and the effects and outcomes of treatments for such cancers.

(2) Use of funds

Amounts received under an award under paragraph (1) may be used to carry out the following:

(A) Collect and store high-quality, donated biospecimens and associated clinical and demographic information on children, adolescents, and young adults diagnosed with cancer in the United States, focusing on children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer enrolled in clinical trials for whom current treatments are least effective. Activities under this subparagraph may include storage of biospecimens and associated clinical and demographic data at existing biorepositories supported by the National Cancer Institute, such as collected samples of both solid tumor cancer and paired samples.

(B) Maintain an interoperable, secure, and searchable database on stored biospecimens and associated clinical and demographic data from children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer for the purposes of research by scientists and qualified health care professionals.

(C) Establish and implement procedures for evaluating applications for access to such biospecimens and clinical and demographic data from researchers and other qualified health care professionals.

(D) Provide access to biospecimens and clinical and demographic data from children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer to researchers and qualified health care professionals for peer-reviewed research

(i) consistent with the procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (C);

(ii) only to the extent permitted by applicable Federal and State law; and

(iii) in a manner that protects personal privacy to the extent required by applicable Federal and State privacy law, at minimum.

(3) No requirement

No child, adolescent, or young adult with cancer shall be required under this subsection to contribute a specimen to a biorepository or share clinical or demographic data.

(4) Application; considerations

(A) Application

To be eligible to receive an award under paragraph (1) an entity shall submit an application to the Secretary at such a time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may reasonably require.

(B) Considerations

In evaluating applications submitted under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider the existing infrastructure of the entity that would allow for the timely capture of biospecimens and related clinical and demographic information for children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer for whom current treatments are least effective.

(5) Privacy protections and informed consent

(A) In general

The Secretary may not make an award under paragraph (1) to an entity unless the Secretary ensures that such entity

(i) collects biospecimens and associated clinical and demographic information only from participants who have given their informed consent in accordance with Federal and State law; and

(ii) protects personal privacy to the extent required by applicable Federal and State law, at minimum.

(B) Informed consent

The Secretary shall ensure biospecimens and associated clinical and demographic information are collected with informed consent, as described in subparagraph (A)(i).

(6) Guidelines and oversight

The Secretary shall develop and disseminate appropriate guidelines for the development and maintenance of the biorepositories supported under this subsection, including appropriate oversight, to facilitate further research on select cancer subtypes (and their recurrences) in children, adolescents, and young adults with such cancers (and their recurrences).

(7) Coordination

To encourage the greatest possible efficiency and effectiveness of federally supported efforts with respect to the activities described in this subsection, the Secretary shall ensure the appropriate coordination of programs supported under this section with existing federally supported cancer registry programs and the activities under section 280e–3a of this title , as appropriate.

(8) Supplement not supplant

Funds provided under this subsection shall be used to supplement, and not supplant, Federal and non-Federal funds available for carrying out the activities described in this subsection.

(9) Report

Not later than 4 years after January 5, 2023 , the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on

(A) the number of biospecimens and corresponding clinical demographic data collected through the biospecimen research efforts supported under paragraph (1);

(B) the number of biospecimens and corresponding clinical demographic data requested for use by researchers;

(C) barriers to the collection of biospecimens and corresponding clinical demographic data;

(D) barriers experienced by researchers or health care professionals in accessing the biospecimens and corresponding clinical demographic data necessary for use in research; and

(E) recommendations with respect to improving the biospecimen and biorepository research efforts under this subsection.

(10) Report on researcher access to children’s cancer biorepository samples

Not later than 2 years after January 5, 2023 , the Director of NIH shall

(A) conduct a review of the procedures established under paragraph (2)(C) and other policies or procedures related to researcher access to such biospecimens to identify any opportunities to reduce administrative burden, consistent with paragraph (2)(D), in a manner that protects personal privacy to the extent required by applicable Federal and State privacy law, at a minimum; and

(B) submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the findings of the review under subparagraph (A) and whether the Director of NIH plans to make any changes to the policies or procedures considered in such review, based on such findings.
