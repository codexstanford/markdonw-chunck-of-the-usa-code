(1) Authority

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall set aside from amounts made available for each State for loans under this section, not less than 9 percent of the amounts available in each fiscal year. Amounts set aside shall be available only for nonprofit entities in the State, which may not be wholly or partially owned or controlled by a for-profit entity. A partnership, that has as its general partner a nonprofit entity or the nonprofit entity’s for-profit subsidiary, is eligible to receive funds set aside under this subsection to sponsor a project which is receiving low-income housing tax credits authorized under section 42 of title 26 . For the purposes of this subsection, a nonprofit entity is an organization that

(A) will own an interest in a project to be financed under this section and will materially participate in the development and the operation of the project;

(B) is a private organization that has nonprofit, tax exempt status under section 501(c)(3) or section 501(c)(4) of title 26 ;

(C) has among its purposes the planning, development, or management of low-income housing or community development projects; and

(D) is not affiliated with or controlled by a for-profit organization.

(2) Minimum State set-aside

If the amount set aside under paragraph (1) for any State is less than $750,000 in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall pool such amount together with set-aside amounts from other States whose set-aside is less than $750,000, and shall make such amounts available for such eligible entities under paragraph (1) in any such State. The Secretary shall establish a procedure to provide that any amounts pooled under this paragraph from the allocation for any State in any fiscal year that are not obligated during a reasonable period in such year shall be made available for any such eligible entities under paragraph (1) in such State. The Secretary may provide amounts available for reallocation under this subsection in excess of $750,000 in a given State, if such amounts are necessary to finance a project under this section.

(3) Unused amounts

(A) Equitable distribution

Any amounts set aside under this subsection from the allocation for any State that are not obligated by 9 months after the allocation, shall first be pooled and made available to any other eligible nonprofit entity in any State as defined in this subsection. The Secretary shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that pooled funds are distributed under this subparagraph in an equitable manner.

(B) Return to the States

After funds have been pooled and obligated for 30 days, the Secretary shall return any remaining funds to the States on a proportional basis for use by any other eligible entity as defined in this section.
