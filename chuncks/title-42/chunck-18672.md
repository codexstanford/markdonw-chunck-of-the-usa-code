### CHAPTER 109B— SECURE WATER
#### § 10367. Water data enhancement by United States Geological Survey
##### (b) National groundwater resources monitoring

(1) In general

The Secretary shall develop a systematic groundwater monitoring program for each major aquifer system located in the United States.

(2) Program elements

In developing the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) establish appropriate criteria for monitoring wells to ensure the acquisition of long-term, high-quality data sets, including, to the maximum extent possible, the inclusion of real-time instrumentation and reporting;

(B) in coordination with the Advisory Committee and State and local water resource agencies

(i) assess the current scope of groundwater monitoring based on the access availability and capability of each monitoring well in existence as of March 30, 2009 ; and

(ii) develop and carry out a monitoring plan that maximizes coverage for each major aquifer system that is located in the United States; and

(C) prior to initiating any specific monitoring activities within a State after March 30, 2009 , consult and coordinate with the applicable State water resource agency with jurisdiction over the aquifer that is the subject of the monitoring activities, and comply with all applicable laws (including regulations) of the State.

(3) Program objectives

In carrying out the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) provide data that is necessary for the improvement of understanding with respect to surface water and groundwater interactions;

(B) by expanding the network of monitoring wells to reach each climate division, support the groundwater climate response network to improve the understanding of the effects of global climate change on groundwater recharge and availability; and

(C) support the objectives of the assessment program.

(4) Improved methodologies

The Secretary shall

(A) improve methodologies relating to the analysis and delivery of data; and

(B) investigate, develop, and implement new methodologies and technologies to estimate or measure groundwater recharge, discharge, and storage in a more cost-efficient manner.

(5) Federal share

The Federal share of the monitoring program described in paragraph (1) may be 100 percent of the cost of carrying out the monitoring program.

(6) Priority

In selecting monitoring activities consistent with the monitoring program described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give priority to those activities for which a State or local governmental entity agrees to provide for a substantial share of the cost of establishing or operating a monitoring well or other measuring device to carry out a monitoring activity.

(7) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this subsection for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2023, to remain available until expended.
