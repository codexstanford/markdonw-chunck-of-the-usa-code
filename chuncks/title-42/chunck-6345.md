(A) such amounts (not in excess of the applicable limit provided by paragraph (3) and, with respect to clause (ii), not in excess of the limit provided by paragraph (4)) as the Congress may deem appropriate for the purpose of

(i) assisting the States in the administration of their unemployment compensation laws as provided in subchapter III (including administration pursuant to agreements under any Federal unemployment compensation law),

(ii) the establishment and maintenance of systems of public employment offices in accordance with the Act of June 6, 1933 , as amended (29 U.S.C., secs. 49–49n), and

(iii) carrying into effect section 4103 of title 38 ;

(B) such amounts (not in excess of the limit provided by paragraph (4) with respect to clause (iii)) as the Congress may deem appropriate for the necessary expenses of the Department of Labor for the performance of its functions under

(i) this subchapter and subchapters III and XII of this chapter,

(ii) the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.],

(iii) the provisions of the Act of June 6, 1933 , as amended [ 29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.],

(iv) chapter 41 (except section 4103) of title 38, and

(v) any Federal unemployment compensation law. The term “necessary expenses” as used in this subparagraph (B) shall include the expense of reimbursing a State for salaries and other expenses of employees of such State temporarily assigned or detailed to duty with the Department of Labor and of paying such employees for travel expenses, transportation of household goods, and per diem in lieu of subsistence while away from their regular duty stations in the State, at rates authorized by law for civilian employees of the Federal Government.

(2) The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to pay from the employment security administration account into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts the amount estimated by him which will be expended during a three-month period by the Treasury Department for the performance of its functions under

(A) this subchapter and subchapters III and XII of this chapter, including the expenses of banks for servicing unemployment benefit payment and clearing accounts which are offset by the maintenance of balances of Treasury funds with such banks,

(B) the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.], and

(C) any Federal unemployment compensation law with respect to which responsibility for administration is vested in the Secretary of Labor. If it subsequently appears that the estimates under this paragraph in any particular period were too high or too low, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in future payments.

(3)

(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the limitation on the amount authorized to be made available for any fiscal year after June 30, 1970 , is, except as provided in subparagraph (B) and in the second sentence of subsection (f)(3)(A), an amount equal to 95 percent of the amount estimated and set forth in the budget of the United States Government for such fiscal year as the amount by which the net receipts during such year under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] will exceed the amount transferred under section 1105(b) of this title during such year to the extended unemployment compensation account.

(B) The limitation established by subparagraph (A) is increased by any unexpended amount retained in the employment security administration account in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(B).

(C) Each estimate of net receipts under this paragraph shall be based upon a tax rate of 0.6 percent.

(4) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(ii) and (1)(B)(iii) the amount authorized to be made available out of the employment security administration account for any fiscal year after June 30, 1972 , shall reflect the proportion of the total cost of administering the system of public employment offices in accordance with the Act of June 6, 1933 , as amended [ 29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.], and of the necessary expenses of the Department of Labor for the performance of its functions under the provisions of such Act, as the President determines is an appropriate charge to the employment security administration account, and reflects in his annual budget for such year. The President’s determination, after consultation with the Secretary, shall take into account such factors as the relationship between employment subject to State laws and the total labor force in the United States, the number of claimants and the number of job applicants, and such other factors as he finds relevant.
