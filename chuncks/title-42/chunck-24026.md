#### § 19331. Microelectronics research for energy innovation
##### (b) Findings

Congress finds that

(1) the coming end of Moore’s Law presents major technological challenges and opportunities for the United States and has important implications for national security, economic competitiveness, and scientific discovery;

(2) future progress and innovation in microelectronics, and the maintenance of a robust domestic microelectronics supply chain, will require an approach that advances relevant materials science, electronic and photonic device technologies, processing and packaging technologies, manufacturing technologies, circuit, chip, and system architecture, and software system and algorithm development in a codesign fashion;

(3) the National Laboratories possess unique technical expertise and user facilities that are essential to

(A) overcoming foundational research challenges relevant to the topics described in paragraph (2); and

(B) translating and transferring research outcomes to industry; and

(4) the expertise and user facilities of the National Laboratories described in paragraph (3) will enable the Department to drive advances in microelectronics that are essential to meeting future needs in areas critical to the missions of the Department and the future competitiveness of the domestic microelectronics industry, including high-performance computing, emerging data-centric computing approaches and energy-efficient computing, optical sensors, sources, and wireless networks, and power electronics and electricity delivery systems.
