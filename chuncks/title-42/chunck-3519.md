#### § 300c–22. Blood-separation centers
##### (a) Grants and contracts with public and nonprofit private entities for projects to develop and expand existing facilities; definitions

The Secretary may make grants to and enter into contracts with public and nonprofit private entities for projects to develop and expand, within existing facilities, blood-separation centers to separate and make available for distribution blood components to providers of blood services and manufacturers of blood fractions. For purposes of this section

(1) the term “blood components” means those constituents of whole blood which are used for therapy and which are obtained by physical separation processes which result in licensed products such as red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, AHF-rich plasma, fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and single unit plasma for infusion; and

(2) the term “blood fractions” means those constituents of plasma which are used for therapy and which are obtained by licensed fractionation processes presently used in manufacturing which result in licensed products such as normal serum albumin, plasma, protein fraction, prothrombin complex, fibrinogen, AHF concentrate, immune serum globulin, and hyperimmune globulins.
