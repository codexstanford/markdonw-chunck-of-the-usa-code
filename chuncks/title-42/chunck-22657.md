#### § 17232. Better energy storage technology
##### (b) Energy Storage System Research, Development, and Deployment Program

(1) Establishment

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall establish a program, to be known as the Energy Storage System Research, Development, and Deployment Program.

(2) Initial program objectives

The program shall focus on research, development, and deployment of

(A) energy storage systems, components, and materials designed to further the development of technologies

(i) for large-scale commercial deployment;

(ii) for deployment at cost targets established by the Secretary;

(iii) for hourly and subhourly durations required to provide reliability services to the grid;

(iv) for daily durations, which have the capacity to discharge energy for a minimum of 6 hours;

(v) for weekly or monthly durations, which have the capacity to discharge energy for 10 to 100 hours, at a minimum; and

(vi) for seasonal durations, which have the capability to address seasonal variations in supply and demand;

(B) distributed energy storage technologies and applications, including building-grid integration;

(C) long-term cost, performance, and demonstration targets for different types of energy storage systems and for use in a variety of regions, including rural areas;

(D) transportation energy storage technologies and applications, including vehicle-grid integration;

(E) cost-effective systems and methods for

(i) the sustainable and secure sourcing, reclamation, recycling, and disposal of energy storage systems, including critical minerals; and

(ii) the reuse and repurposing of energy storage system technologies;

(F) advanced control methods for energy storage systems;

(G) pumped hydroelectric energy storage systems to advance

(i) adoption of innovative technologies, including

(I) systems with adjustable-speed and other new pumping and generating equipment designs;

(II) modular systems;

(III) closed-loop systems, including mines and quarries; and

(IV) other innovative equipment and materials as determined by the Secretary; and

(ii) reductions of civil works costs and construction times for hydropower and pumped storage systems, including comprehensive data and systems analysis of hydropower and pumped storage construction technologies and processes in order to identify areas for whole-system efficiency gains;

(H) models and tools to demonstrate the costs and benefits of energy storage to

(i) power and water supply systems;

(ii) electric generation portfolio optimization; and

(iii) expanded deployment of other renewable energy technologies, including in integrated energy storage systems;

(I) energy storage use cases from individual and combination technology applications, including value from various-use cases and energy storage services; and

(J) advanced manufacturing technologies that have the potential to improve United States competitiveness in energy storage manufacturing or reduce United States dependence on critical materials.

(3) Testing and validation

In coordination with 1 or more National Laboratories, the Secretary shall support the development, standardized testing, and validation of energy storage systems under the program, including test-bed and field trials, by developing testing and evaluation methodologies for

(A) storage technologies, controls, and power electronics for energy storage systems under a variety of operating conditions;

(B) standardized and grid performance testing for energy storage systems, materials, and technologies during each stage of development;

(C) reliability, safety, degradation, and durability testing under standard and evolving duty cycles; and

(D) accelerated life testing protocols to predict estimated lifetime metrics with accuracy.

(4) Periodic evaluation of program objectives

Not less frequently than once every calendar year, the Secretary shall evaluate and, if necessary, update the program objectives to ensure that the program continues to advance energy storage systems toward widespread commercial deployment by lowering the costs and increasing the duration of energy storage resources.

(5) Energy storage strategic plan

(A) In general

The Secretary shall develop a 10-year strategic plan for the program, and update the plan, in accordance with this paragraph.

(B) Contents

The strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A) shall

(i) be coordinated with and integrated across other relevant offices in the Department;

(ii) to the extent practicable, include metrics that can be used to evaluate storage technologies;

(iii) identify Department programs that

(I) support the research and development activities described in paragraph (2) and the demonstration projects under subsection (c); and

(II)

(aa) do not support the activities or projects described in subclause (I); but

(bb) are important to the development of energy storage systems and the mission of the Department, as determined by the Secretary;

(iv) include expected timelines for

(I) the accomplishment of relevant objectives under current programs of the Department relating to energy storage systems; and

(II) the commencement of any new initiatives within the Department relating to energy storage systems to accomplish those objectives; and

(v) incorporate relevant activities described in the Grid Modernization Initiative Multi-Year Program Plan.

(C) Submission to Congress

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives the strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A).

(D) Updates to plan

The Secretary

(i) shall annually review the strategic plan developed under subparagraph (A); and

(ii) may periodically revise the strategic plan as appropriate.

(6) Leveraging of resources

The program may be led by a specific office of the Department, but shall be cross-cutting in nature, so that in carrying out activities under the program, the Secretary (or a designee of the Secretary charged with leading the program) shall leverage existing Federal resources, including, at a minimum, the expertise and resources of

(A) the Office of Electricity;

(B) the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, including the Water Power Technologies Office; and

(C) the Office of Science, including

(i) the Basic Energy Sciences Program;

(ii) the Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program;

(iii) the Biological and Environmental Research Program; and

(D) the Electricity Storage Research Initiative established under section 16315 of this title .

(7) Protecting privacy and security

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall identify, incorporate, and follow best practices for protecting the privacy of individuals and businesses and the respective sensitive data of the individuals and businesses, including by managing privacy risk and implementing the Fair Information Practice Principles of the Federal Trade Commission for the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of individual electric consumer information in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A–130 (or successor circulars).
