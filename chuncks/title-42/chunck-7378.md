#### § 1395u. Provisions relating to the administration of part B
##### (b) Determination of reasonable charges
######## (A) In the case of physicians’ services furnished to a patient in a hospital with a teaching program approved as specified in section 1395x(b)(6) of this title but which does not meet the conditions described in section 1395x(b)(7) of this title , the Secretary shall not provide (except on the basis described in subparagraph (C)) for payment for such services under this part

(i) unless

(I) the physician renders sufficient personal and identifiable physicians’ services to the patient to exercise full, personal control over the management of the portion of the case for which the payment is sought,

(II) the services are of the same character as the services the physician furnishes to patients not entitled to benefits under this subchapter, and

(III) at least 25 percent of the hospital’s patients (during a representative past period, as determined by the Secretary) who were not entitled to benefits under this subchapter and who were furnished services described in subclauses (I) and (II) paid all or a substantial part of charges (other than nominal charges) imposed for such services; and

(ii) to the extent that the payment is based upon a reasonable charge for the services in excess of the customary charge as determined in accordance with subparagraph (B).

(B) The customary charge for such services in a hospital shall be determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary and taking into account the following factors:

(i) In the case of a physician who is not a teaching physician (as defined by the Secretary), the Secretary shall take into account the amounts the physician charges for similar services in the physician’s practice outside the teaching setting.

(ii) In the case of a teaching physician, if the hospital, its physicians, or other appropriate billing entity has established one or more schedules of charges which are collected for medical and surgical services, the Secretary shall base payment under this subchapter on the greatest of

(I) the charges (other than nominal charges) which are most frequently collected in full or substantial part with respect to patients who were not entitled to benefits under this subchapter and who were furnished services described in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i),

(II) the mean of the charges (other than nominal charges) which were collected in full or substantial part with respect to such patients, or

(III) 85 percent of the prevailing charges paid for similar services in the same locality.

(iii) If all the teaching physicians in a hospital agree to have payment made for all of their physicians’ services under this part furnished to patients in such hospital on an assignment-related basis, the customary charge for such services shall be equal to 90 percent of the prevailing charges paid for similar services in the same locality.

(C) In the case of physicians’ services furnished to a patient in a hospital with a teaching program approved as specified in section 1395x(b)(6) of this title but which does not meet the conditions described in section 1395x(b)(7) of this title , if the conditions described in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i) are met and if the physician elects payment to be determined under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide for payment for such services under this part on the basis of regulations of the Secretary governing reimbursement for the services of hospital-based physicians (and not on any other basis).
