##### (g) Annual reimbursement of Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969 , and for each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as the Commissioner of Social Security deems necessary on account of

(1) payments made under this section during the second preceding fiscal year and all fiscal years prior thereto to individuals who, as of the beginning of the calendar year in which falls the month for which payment was made, had less than 3 quarters of coverage,

(2) the additional administrative expenses resulting from the payments described in paragraph (1), and

(3) any loss in interest to such Trust Fund resulting from such payments and expenses, in order to place such Trust Fund in the same position at the end of such fiscal year as it would have been in if such payments had not been made.
