##### (b) Design and contents

(1) Purpose

The form under subsection (a) shall be designed to facilitate compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of this chapter.

The form shall require identification of the type of flood-risk zone in which the building or mobile home is located, the complete map and panel numbers for the improved real estate or property on which the mobile home is located, the community identification number and community participation status (for purposes of the national flood insurance program) of the community in which the improved real estate or such property is located, and the date of the map used for the determination, with respect to flood hazard information on file with the Administrator.

The form shall provide for inclusion or attachment of any relevant documents indicating revisions or amendments to maps.
