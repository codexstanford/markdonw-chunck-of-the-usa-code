(A) for 2012, by 1.5 percentage points;

(B) for 2013, by 3.0 percentage points; and

(C) for 2014 or a subsequent year, by 5.0 percentage points.

(2) Increase for qualifying plans in qualifying counties

The increase applied under paragraph (1) for a qualifying plan located in a qualifying county for a year shall be doubled.

(3) Qualifying plans and qualifying county defined; application of increases to low enrollment and new plans

For purposes of this subsection:

(A) Qualifying plan

(i) In general

The term “qualifying plan” means, for a year and subject to paragraph (4), a plan that had a quality rating under paragraph (4) of 4 stars or higher based on the most recent data available for such year.

(ii) Application of increases to low enrollment plans

(I) 2012

For 2012, the term “qualifying plan” includes an MA plan that the Secretary determines is not able to have a quality rating under paragraph (4) because of low enrollment.

(II) 2013 and subsequent years

For 2013 and subsequent years, for purposes of determining whether an MA plan with low enrollment (as defined by the Secretary) is included as a qualifying plan, the Secretary shall establish a method to apply to MA plans with low enrollment (as defined by the Secretary) the computation of quality rating and the rating system under paragraph (4).

(iii) Application of increases to new plans

(I) In general

A new MA plan that meets criteria specified by the Secretary shall be treated as a qualifying plan, except that in applying paragraph (1), the applicable percentage under subsection (n)(2)(B) shall be increased

(aa) for 2012, by 1.5 percentage points;

(bb) for 2013, by 2.5 percentage points; and

(cc) for 2014 or a subsequent year, by 3.5 percentage points.

(II) New MA plan defined

The term “new MA plan” means, with respect to a year, a plan offered by an organization or sponsor that has not had a contract as a Medicare Advantage organization in the preceding 3-year period.

(B) Qualifying county

The term “qualifying county” means, for a year, a county

(i) that has an MA capitation rate that, in 2004, was based on the amount specified in subsection (c)(1)(B) for a Metropolitan Statistical Area with a population of more than 250,000;

(ii) for which, as of December 2009, of the Medicare Advantage eligible individuals residing in the county at least 25 percent of such individuals were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; and

(iii) that has per capita fee-for-service spending that is lower than the national monthly per capita cost for expenditures for individuals enrolled under the original medicare fee-for-service program for the year.

(4) Quality determinations for application of increase

(A) Quality determination

The quality rating for a plan shall be determined according to a 5-star rating system (based on the data collected under section 1395w–22(e) of this title ).

(B) Plans that failed to report

An MA plan which does not report data that enables the Secretary to rate the plan for purposes of this paragraph shall be counted as having a rating of fewer than 3.5 stars.

(C) Special rule for first 3 plan years for plans that were converted from a reasonable cost reimbursement contract

For purposes of applying paragraph (1) and section 1395w–24(b)(1)(C) of this title for the first 3 plan years under this part in the case of an MA plan to which deemed enrollment applies under section 1395w–21(c)(4) of this title

(i) such plan shall not be treated as a new MA plan (as defined in paragraph (3)(A)(iii)(II)); and

(ii) in determining the star rating of the plan under subparagraph (A), to the extent that Medicare Advantage data for such plan is not available for a measure used to determine such star rating, the Secretary shall use data from the period in which such plan was a reasonable cost reimbursement contract.

(D) Special rule to prevent the artificial inflation of star ratings after the consolidation of Medicare Advantage plans offered by a single organization

(i) In general

If

(I) a Medicare Advantage organization has entered into more than one contract with the Secretary with respect to the offering of Medicare Advantage plans; and

(II) on or after January 1, 2019 , the Secretary approves a request from the organization to consolidate the plans under one or more contract  8 (in this subparagraph referred to as a “closed contract”) with the plans offered under a separate contract (in this subparagraph referred to as the “continuing contract”);  with respect to the continuing contract, the Secretary shall adjust the quality rating under the 5-star rating system and any quality increase under this subsection and rebate amounts under section 1395w–24 of this title to reflect an enrollment-weighted average of scores or ratings for the continuing and closed contracts, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

(ii) Application

An adjustment under clause (i) shall apply for any year for which the quality rating of the continuing contract is based primarily on a measurement period that is prior to the first year in which a closed contract is no longer offered.

(5) Exception for PACE plans

This subsection shall not apply to payments to a PACE program under section 1395eee of this title .

(6) Quality measurement at the plan level for SNPs

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may require reporting of data under section 1395w–22(e) of this title for, and apply under this subsection, quality measures at the plan level for specialized MA plans for special needs individuals instead of at the contract level.

(B) Considerations

Prior to applying quality measurement at the plan level under this paragraph, the Secretary shall

(i) take into consideration the minimum number of enrollees in a specialized MA plan for special needs individuals in order to determine if a statistically significant or valid measurement of quality at the plan level is possible under this paragraph;

(ii) take into consideration the impact of such application on plans that serve a disproportionate number of individuals dually eligible for benefits under this subchapter and under subchapter XIX;

(iii) if quality measures are reported at the plan level, ensure that MA plans are not required to provide duplicative information; and

(iv) ensure that such reporting does not interfere with the collection of encounter data submitted by MA organizations or the administration of any changes to the program under this part as a result of the collection of such data.

(C) Application

If the Secretary applies quality measurement at the plan level under this paragraph

(i) such quality measurement may include Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS), Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures and quality measures under part D; and

(ii) the Secretary shall consider applying administrative actions, such as remedies described in section 1395w–27(g)(2) of this title , at the plan level.

(7) Determination of feasibility of quality measurement at the plan level for all MA plans

(A) Determination of feasibility

The Secretary shall determine the feasibility of requiring reporting of data under section 1395w–22(e) of this title for, and applying under this subsection, quality measures at the plan level for all MA plans under this part.

(B) Consideration of change

After making a determination under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider requiring such reporting and applying such quality measures at the plan level as described in such subparagraph  3
