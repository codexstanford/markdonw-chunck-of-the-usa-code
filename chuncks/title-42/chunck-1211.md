### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 274f–5. Criteria, standards, and regulations with respect to organs infected with HIV
##### (c) Revision of standards and regulations generally

Not later than 4 years after November 21, 2013 , and annually thereafter, the Secretary, 1 shall

(1) review the results of scientific research in conjunction with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to determine whether the results warrant revision of the standards of quality adopted under section 274(b)(2)(E) of this title with respect to donated organs infected with HIV and with respect to the safety of transplanting an organ with a particular strain of HIV into a recipient with a different strain of HIV;

(2) if the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that such results warrant revision of the standards of quality adopted under section 274(b)(2)(E) of this title with respect to donated organs infected with HIV and with respect to transplanting an organ with a particular strain of HIV into a recipient with a different strain of HIV, direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to revise such standards, consistent with section 274 of this title and in a way that ensures the changes will not reduce the safety of organ transplantation; and

(3) in conjunction with any revision of such standards under paragraph (2), revise section 121.6 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations).
