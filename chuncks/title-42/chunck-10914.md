#### § 2021e. Limited availability of certain regional disposal facilities during transition and licensing periods
##### (a) Availability of disposal capacity

(1) Pressurized water and boiling water reactors

During the seven-year period beginning January 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992 , subject to the provisions of subsections (b) through (g), each State in which there is located a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) shall make disposal capacity available for low-level radioactive waste generated by pressurized water and boiling water commercial nuclear power reactors in accordance with the allocations established in subsection (c).

(2) Other sources of low-level radioactive waste

During the seven-year period beginning January 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992 , subject to the provisions of subsections (b) through (g), each State in which there is located a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) shall make disposal capacity available for low-level radioactive waste generated by any source not referred to in paragraph (1).

(3) Allocation of disposal capacity

(A) During the seven-year period beginning January 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992 , low-level radioactive waste generated within a sited compact region shall be accorded priority under this section in the allocation of available disposal capacity at a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) and located in the sited compact region in which such waste is generated.

(B) Any State in which a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) is located may, subject to the provisions of its compact, prohibit the disposal at such facility of low-level radioactive waste generated outside of the compact region if the disposal of such waste in any given calendar year, together with all other low-level radioactive waste disposed of at such facility within that same calendar year, would result in that facility disposing of a total annual volume of low-level radioactive waste in excess of 100 per centum of the average annual volume for such facility designated in subsection (b): Provided, however , That in the event that all three States in which regional disposal facilities referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) act to prohibit the disposal of low-level radioactive waste pursuant to this subparagraph, each such State shall, in accordance with any applicable procedures of its compact, permit, as necessary, the disposal of additional quantities of such waste in increments of 10 per centum of the average annual volume for each such facility designated in subsection (b).

(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall require any disposal facility or State referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) to accept for disposal low-level radioactive waste in excess of the total amounts designated in subsection (b).

(4) Cessation of operation of low-level radioactive waste disposal facility

No provision of this section shall be construed to obligate any State referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) to accept low-level radioactive waste from any source in the event that the regional disposal facility located in such State ceases operations.
