The Secretary shall, during September of each year (beginning with 2022), determine and promulgate a monthly premium rate for the succeeding calendar year for individuals enrolled only for the purpose of coverage of immunosuppressive drugs under section 1395 o (b) of this title. Such premium shall be equal to 15 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over (as would be determined in accordance with subsection (a)(1) if the reference to “one-half” in such subsection were a reference to “100 percent”) for that succeeding calendar year. The monthly premium of each individual enrolled for coverage of immunosuppressive drugs under section 1395 o (b) of this title for each month shall be the amount promulgated in this subsection. In the case of such individual not otherwise enrolled under this part, such premium shall be in lieu of any other monthly premium applicable under this section. Such amount shall be adjusted in accordance with subsections (c), (f), and (i), but shall not be adjusted under subsection (b).
