#### § 18911. Basic energy sciences program
##### (e) Carbon Materials Science Initiative

(1) Initiative

(A) In general

The Director of the Office of Science (referred to in this subsection as the “Director”) shall establish a research initiative, to be known as the “Carbon Materials Science Initiative” (referred to in this subsection as the “Initiative”), to expand the fundamental knowledge of coal, coal-wastes, and carbon ore chemistry useful for understanding the conversion of carbon to material products.

(B) Coordination

In carrying out programs and activities under the Initiative, the Director shall leverage expertise and resources from the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and the United States Geological Survey.

(C) Teams

(i) In general

In carrying out the Initiative, the Director shall establish and organize activities among multidisciplinary teams to leverage, to the maximum extent practicable, expertise from the National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and the private sector.

(ii) Goals

The multidisciplinary teams described in clause (i) shall pursue expedient, milestone-driven research goals established by the Director.

(2) Research program

(A) In general

The Director shall carry out under the Initiative a program to support, and discover fundamental knowledge relevant to, carbon materials and carbon ore processing research.

(B) Activities

As part of the program described in subparagraph (A), the Director shall, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, as appropriate, support research to pursue distinct lines of scientific inquiry, including

(i) methods of extraction, processing, recycling, and utilization of the materials and valuable minerals contained in raw coal and coal-waste;

(ii) methods of improving performance, cost, and availability of materials for use in carbon capture systems; and

(iii) unconventional pathways and materials for conversion of carbon dioxide molecules, minerals, and materials.

(C) Review

The Director shall periodically review activities carried out under the program described in subparagraph (A) to evaluate the achievement of scientific objectives and research milestones.

(D) Coordination with existing programs and centers

In carrying out the program described in subparagraph (A), the Director shall

(i) ensure coordination and knowledge sharing with

(I) the United States Geological Survey; and

(II) the programs and the Carbon Utilization Research Center established under section 16298a of this title ; and

(ii) avoid duplication of efforts to the maximum extent practicable.

(3) Carbon Materials Research Centers

(A) In general

In carrying out the activities authorized under paragraph (2), the Director shall establish 1 center in each of the 2 major coal-producing regions of the United States, each of which shall

(i) be known as a “Carbon Materials Research Center” (referred to in this paragraph as a “Center”); and

(ii) focus on early stage research and development activities, including

(I) developing and advancing methods of extracting, processing, or recycling carbon or other valuable materials or minerals from raw coal, coal-waste, or other solid carbon materials, for the development of new carbon-based materials;

(II) methods of improving the structural, physical, and chemical properties of carbon-based materials or other valuable materials from raw coal, coal-waste, or other solid carbon materials and their recyclability;

(III) overcoming the challenges and maximizing the benefits of commercially extracting, producing, or improving coal-derived carbon and resulting products; and

(IV) identifying novel pathways and materials for carbon storage and conversion into useful products.

(B) Selection

The Director shall

(i) select Centers under subparagraph (A) on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis; and

(ii) consider applications from the National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, multi-institutional collaborations, and other appropriate entities.

(C) Duration

A Center shall receive support for a period of not more than 5 years beginning on the date of establishment of that Center, subject to the availability of appropriations.

(D) Renewal

On the expiration of any period of support of a Center, the Director may renew support for that Center, on a merit-reviewed basis, for a period of not more than 5 years.

(E) Existing facilities

The Director shall

(i) ensure that the research activities carried out by the Centers are not duplicative of existing efforts; and

(ii) if practicable, leverage existing user facilities and other capabilities of the Department of Energy to carry out the research objectives of the Centers.
