#### § 280g–17. Designation and investigation of potential cancer clusters
##### (b) Criteria for designation of potential cancer clusters

(1) Development of criteria

The Secretary shall develop criteria for the designation of potential cancer clusters.

(2) Requirements

The criteria developed under paragraph (1) shall consider, as appropriate

(A) a standard for cancer cluster identification and reporting protocols used to determine when cancer incidence is greater than would be typically observed;

(B) scientific screening standards that ensure that a cluster of a particular cancer involves the same type of cancer, or types of cancers;

(C) the population in which the cluster of a particular cancer occurs by factors such as race, ethnicity, age, and gender, for purposes of calculating cancer rates;

(D) the boundaries of a geographic area in which a cluster of a particular cancer occurs so as not to create or obscure a potential cluster by selection of a specific area; and

(E) the time period over which the number of cases of a particular cancer, or the calculation of an expected number of cases, occurs.
