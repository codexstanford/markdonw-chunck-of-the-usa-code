(A) to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(A) not in excess of 85 percent of net average allowable costs (as defined in paragraph (3)(E)) for certified EHR technology (and support services including maintenance and training that is for, or is necessary for the adoption and operation of, such technology) with respect to such providers; and

(B) to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(B) not in excess of the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (5) for the provider involved.

(2) In this subsection and subsection (a)(3)(F), the term “Medicaid provider” means

(A) an eligible professional (as defined in paragraph (3)(B))

(i) who is not hospital-based and has at least 30 percent of the professional’s patient volume (as estimated in accordance with a methodology established by the Secretary) attributable to individuals who are receiving medical assistance under this subchapter;

(ii) who is not described in clause (i), who is a pediatrician, who is not hospital-based, and who has at least 20 percent of the professional’s patient volume (as estimated in accordance with a methodology established by the Secretary) attributable to individuals who are receiving medical assistance under this subchapter; and

(iii) who practices predominantly in a Federally qualified health center or rural health clinic and has at least 30 percent of the professional’s patient volume (as estimated in accordance with a methodology established by the Secretary) attributable to needy individuals (as defined in paragraph (3)(F)); and

For purposes of calculating patient volume under subparagraph (A)(iii), insofar as it is related to uncompensated care, the Secretary may require the adjustment of such uncompensated care data so that it would be an appropriate proxy for charity care, including a downward adjustment to eliminate bad debt data from uncompensated care. In applying subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii), the methodology established by the Secretary for patient volume shall include individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under subsection (m) or section 1396u–2 of this title ).

(i) physician;

(ii) dentist;

(iii) certified nurse mid-wife;

The determination of whether an eligible professional is a hospital-based eligible professional shall be made on the basis of the site of service (as defined by the Secretary) and without regard to any employment or billing arrangement between the eligible professional and any other provider.

(E) The term “net average allowable costs” means, with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A), average allowable costs reduced by the average payment the Secretary estimates will be made to such Medicaid providers (determined on a percentage or other basis for such classes or types of providers as the Secretary may specify) from other sources (other than under this subsection, or by the Federal government or a State or local government) that is directly attributable to payment for certified EHR technology or support services described in subparagraph (C).
