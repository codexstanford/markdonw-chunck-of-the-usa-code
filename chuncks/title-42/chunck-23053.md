#### § 18051. State flexibility to establish basic health programs for low-income individuals not eligible for medicaid
##### (c) Contracting process

(1) In general

A State basic health program shall establish a competitive process for entering into contracts with standard health plans under subsection (a), including negotiation of premiums and cost-sharing and negotiation of benefits in addition to the essential health benefits described in section 18022(b) of this title .

(2) Specific items to be considered

A State shall, as part of its competitive process under paragraph (1), include at least the following:

(A) Innovation

Negotiation with offerors of a standard health plan for the inclusion of innovative features in the plan, including

(i) care coordination and care management for enrollees, especially for those with chronic health conditions;

(ii) incentives for use of preventive services; and

(iii) the establishment of relationships between providers and patients that maximize patient involvement in health care decision-making, including providing incentives for appropriate utilization under the plan.

(B) Health and resource differences

Consideration of, and the making of suitable allowances for, differences in health care needs of enrollees and differences in local availability of, and access to, health care providers. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as allowing discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions or other health status-related factors.

(C) Managed care

Contracting with managed care systems, or with systems that offer as many of the attributes of managed care as are feasible in the local health care market.

(D) Performance measures

Establishing specific performance measures and standards for issuers of standard health plans that focus on quality of care and improved health outcomes, requiring such plans to report to the State with respect to the measures and standards, and making the performance and quality information available to enrollees in a useful form.

(3) Enhanced availability

(A) Multiple plans

A State shall, to the maximum extent feasible, seek to make multiple standard health plans available to eligible individuals within a State to ensure individuals have a choice of such plans.

(B) Regional compacts

A State may negotiate a regional compact with other States to include coverage of eligible individuals in all such States in agreements with issuers of standard health plans.

(4) Coordination with other State programs

A State shall seek to coordinate the administration of, and provision of benefits under, its program under this section with the State medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], the State child health plan under title XXI of such Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.], and other State-administered health programs to maximize the efficiency of such programs and to improve the continuity of care.
