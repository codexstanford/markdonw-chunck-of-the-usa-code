#### § 16298b. High efficiency turbines
##### (c) Program goals

(1) In general

The goals of the program shall be

(A) in phase I, to develop a conceptual design of, and to develop and demonstrate the technology required for

(i) advanced high efficiency gas turbines to achieve, on a lower heating value basis

(I) a combined cycle efficiency of not less than 65 percent; or

(II) a simple cycle efficiency of not less than 47 percent; and

(ii) aviation gas turbines to achieve a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn by improving fuel efficiency to existing best-in-class turbo-fan engines; and

(B) in phase II, to develop a conceptual design of advanced high efficiency gas turbines that can achieve, on a lower heating value basis

(i) a combined cycle efficiency of not less than 67 percent; or

(ii) a simple cycle efficiency of not less than 50 percent.

(2) Additional goals

If a goal described in paragraph (1) has been achieved, the Secretary, in consultation with private industry and the National Academy of Sciences, may develop additional goals or phases for advanced gas turbine research and development.
