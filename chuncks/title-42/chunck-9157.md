#### § 1437z–4. Resident homeownership programs
##### (i) Resale

(1) Authority and limitation

A homeownership program under this section shall permit the resale of a dwelling unit purchased under the program by an eligible family, but shall provide such limitations on resale as the agency considers appropriate (whether the family purchases directly from the agency or from another entity) for the agency to recapture

(A) some or all of the economic gain derived from any such resale occurring during the 5-year period beginning upon purchase of the dwelling unit by the eligible family; and

(B) after the expiration of such 5-year period, only such amounts as are equivalent to the assistance provided under this section by the agency to the purchaser.

(2) Considerations

The limitations referred to in paragraph (1)(A) may provide for consideration of the aggregate amount of assistance provided under the program to the family, the contribution to equity provided by the purchasing eligible family, the period of time elapsed between purchase under the homeownership program and resale, the reason for resale, any improvements to the property made by the eligible family, any appreciation in the value of the property, and any other factors that the agency considers appropriate.
