#### § 1396r–8. Payment for covered outpatient drugs
##### (d) Limitations on coverage of drugs

(1) Permissible restrictions

(A) A State may subject to prior authorization any covered outpatient drug. Any such prior authorization program shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (5).

(B) A State may exclude or otherwise restrict coverage of a covered outpatient drug if

(i) the prescribed use is not for a medically accepted indication (as defined in subsection (k)(6));

(ii) the drug is contained in the list referred to in paragraph (2);

(iii) the drug is subject to such restrictions pursuant to an agreement between a manufacturer and a State authorized by the Secretary under subsection (a)(1) or in effect pursuant to subsection (a)(4); or

(iv) the State has excluded coverage of the drug from its formulary established in accordance with paragraph (4).

(2) List of drugs subject to restriction

The following drugs or classes of drugs, or their medical uses, may be excluded from coverage or otherwise restricted:

(A) Agents when used for anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain.

(B) Agents when used to promote fertility.

(C) Agents when used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth.

(D) Agents when used for the symptomatic relief of cough and colds.

(E) Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations.

(F) Nonprescription drugs, except, in the case of pregnant women when recommended in accordance with the Guideline referred to in section 1396d(bb)(2)(A) of this title , agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the over-the-counter monograph process for purposes of promoting, and when used to promote, tobacco cessation.

(G) Covered outpatient drugs which the manufacturer seeks to require as a condition of sale that associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer or its designee.

(H) Agents when used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction, unless such agents are used to treat a condition, other than sexual or erectile dysfunction, for which the agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

(3) Update of drug listings

The Secretary shall, by regulation, periodically update the list of drugs or classes of drugs described in paragraph (2) or their medical uses, which the Secretary has determined, based on data collected by surveillance and utilization review programs of State medical assistance programs, to be subject to clinical abuse or inappropriate use.

(4) Requirements for formularies

A State may establish a formulary if the formulary meets the following requirements:

(A) The formulary is developed by a committee consisting of physicians, pharmacists, and other appropriate individuals appointed by the Governor of the State (or, at the option of the State, the State’s drug use review board established under subsection (g)(3)).

(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the formulary includes the covered outpatient drugs of any manufacturer which has entered into and complies with an agreement under subsection (a) (other than any drug excluded from coverage or otherwise restricted under paragraph (2)).

(C) A covered outpatient drug may be excluded with respect to the treatment of a specific disease or condition for an identified population (if any) only if, based on the drug’s labeling (or, in the case of a drug the prescribed use of which is not approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] but is a medically accepted indication, based on information from the appropriate compendia described in subsection (k)(6)), the excluded drug does not have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome of such treatment for such population over other drugs included in the formulary and there is a written explanation (available to the public) of the basis for the exclusion.

(D) The State plan permits coverage of a drug excluded from the formulary (other than any drug excluded from coverage or otherwise restricted under paragraph (2)) pursuant to a prior authorization program that is consistent with paragraph (5).

(E) The formulary meets such other requirements as the Secretary may impose in order to achieve program savings consistent with protecting the health of program beneficiaries. A prior authorization program established by a State under paragraph (5) is not a formulary subject to the requirements of this paragraph.

(5) Requirements of prior authorization programs

A State plan under this subchapter may require, as a condition of coverage or payment for a covered outpatient drug for which Federal financial participation is available in accordance with this section, with respect to drugs dispensed on or after July 1, 1991 , the approval of the drug before its dispensing for any medically accepted indication (as defined in subsection (k)(6)) only if the system providing for such approval

(A) provides response by telephone or other telecommunication device within 24 hours of a request for prior authorization; and

(B) except with respect to the drugs on the list referred to in paragraph (2), provides for the dispensing of at least 72-hour supply of a covered outpatient prescription drug in an emergency situation (as defined by the Secretary).

(6) Other permissible restrictions

A State may impose limitations, with respect to all such drugs in a therapeutic class, on the minimum or maximum quantities per prescription or on the number of refills, if such limitations are necessary to discourage waste, and may address instances of fraud or abuse by individuals in any manner authorized under this chapter.

(7) Non-excludable drugs

The following drugs or classes of drugs, or their medical uses, shall not be excluded from coverage:

(A) Agents when used to promote smoking cessation, including agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the over-the-counter monograph process for purposes of promoting, and when used to promote, tobacco cessation.

(B) Barbiturates.

(C) Benzodiazepines.

(D) Drugs and biological products described in subsection (ee)(1)(A) of section 1396d of this title that are furnished as medical assistance in accordance with subsection (a)(29) of such section and section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title .
