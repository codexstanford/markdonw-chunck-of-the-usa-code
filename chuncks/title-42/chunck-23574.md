#### § 18912. Research security
##### (b) Science and technology risk assessment

(1) In general

The Secretary shall develop and maintain tools and processes to manage and mitigate research security risks, such as a science and technology risk matrix, informed by threats identified by the Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, to facilitate determinations of the risk of loss of United States intellectual property or threat to the national security of the United States posed by activities carried out under any covered support.

(2) Content and implementation

In developing and using the tools and processes developed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) deploy risk-based approaches to evaluating, awarding, and managing certain research, development, demonstration, and deployment activities, including designations that will indicate the relative risk of activities;

(B) assess, to the extent practicable, ongoing high-risk activities;

(C) designate an officer or employee of the Department of Energy to be responsible for tracking and notifying recipients of any covered support of unmanageable threats to United States national security or of theft or loss of United States intellectual property posed by an entity of concern;

(D) consider requiring recipients of covered support to implement additional research security mitigations for higher-risk activities if appropriate; and

(E) support the development of research security training for recipients of covered support on the risks posed by entities of concern.

(3) Annual updates

The tools and processes developed under paragraph (1) shall be evaluated annually and updated as needed, with threat-informed input from the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, to reflect changes in the risk designation under paragraph (2)(A) of research, development, demonstration, and deployment activities conducted by the Department.
