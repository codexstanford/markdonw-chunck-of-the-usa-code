#### § 6991b. Release detection, prevention, and correction regulations
##### (g) Interim prohibition

(1) Until the effective date of the standards promulgated by the Administrator under subsection (e) and after one hundred and eighty days after November 8, 1984 , no person may install an underground storage tank for the purpose of storing regulated substances unless such tank (whether of single or double wall construction)

(A) will prevent releases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the tank;

(B) is cathodically protected against corrosion, constructed of noncorrosive material, steel clad with a noncorrosive material, or designed in a manner to prevent the release or threatened release of any stored substance; and

(C) the material used in the construction or lining of the tank is compatible with the substance to be stored.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if soil tests conducted in accordance with ASTM Standard G57–78, or another standard approved by the Administrator, show that soil resistivity in an installation location is 12,000 ohm/cm or more (unless a more stringent standard is prescribed by the Administrator by rule), a storage tank without corrosion protection may be installed in that location during the period referred to in paragraph (1).
