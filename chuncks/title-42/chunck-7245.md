### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395l. Payment of benefits
##### (i) Outpatient surgery
######## (B) The amount of payment to be made under this part for facility services furnished, in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), in a physician’s office shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary’s estimate of a fair fee which

(i) takes into account additional costs, not usually included in the professional fee, incurred by physicians in securing, maintaining, and staffing the facilities and ancillary services appropriate for the performance of such procedure in the physician’s office, and

(ii) takes such items into account in such a manner which will assure that the performance of such procedure in the physician’s office will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the services had been furnished on an inpatient basis in a hospital. Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987 , and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas.

(C)

(i) Notwithstanding the second sentence of each of subparagraphs (A) and (B), except as otherwise specified in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), if the Secretary has not updated amounts established under such subparagraphs or under subparagraph (D), with respect to facility services furnished during a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986 or a calendar year (beginning with 2006)), such amounts shall be increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with the midpoint of the year involved.

(ii) In each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, the increase under this subparagraph shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 2.0 percentage points.

(iii) In fiscal year 2004, beginning with April 1, 2004 , the increase under this subparagraph shall be the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with March 31, 2003 , minus 3.0 percentage points.

(iv) In fiscal year 2005, the last quarter of calendar year 2005, and each of calendar years 2006 through 2009, the increase under this subparagraph shall be 0 percent.

(D)

(i) Taking into account the recommendations in the report under section 626(d) of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Secretary shall implement a revised payment system for payment of surgical services furnished in ambulatory surgical centers.

(ii) In the year the system described in clause (i) is implemented, such system shall be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for such services as would be made if this subparagraph did not apply, as estimated by the Secretary and taking into account reduced expenditures that would apply if subparagraph (E) were to continue to apply, as estimated by the Secretary.

(iii) The Secretary shall implement the system described in clause (i) for periods in a manner so that it is first effective beginning on or after January 1, 2006 , and not later than January 1, 2008 .

(iv) The Secretary may implement such system in a manner so as to provide for a reduction in any annual update for failure to report on quality measures in accordance with paragraph (7).

(v) In implementing the system described in clause (i) for 2011 and each subsequent year, any annual update under such system for the year, after application of clause (iv), shall be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title . The application of the preceding sentence may result in such update being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the system described in clause (i) for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

(vi) There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff, 1395 oo of this title, or otherwise, of the classification system, the relative weights, payment amounts, and the geographic adjustment factor, if any, under this subparagraph.
