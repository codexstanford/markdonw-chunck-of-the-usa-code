#### § 17052. Renewable fuel infrastructure grants
##### (d) Refueling infrastructure corridors

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish a competitive grant pilot program (referred to in this subsection as the “pilot program”), to be administered through the Vehicle Technology Deployment Program of the Department, to provide not more than 10 geographically-dispersed project grants to State governments, Indian tribal governments, local governments, metropolitan transportation authorities, or partnerships of those entities to carry out 1 or more projects for the purposes described in paragraph (2).

(2) Grant purposes

A grant under this subsection shall be used for the establishment of refueling infrastructure corridors, as designated by the Secretary, for renewable fuel blends, including

(A) installation of infrastructure and equipment necessary to ensure adequate distribution of renewable fuel blends within the corridor;

(B) installation of infrastructure and equipment necessary to directly support vehicles powered by renewable fuel blends; and

(C) operation and maintenance of infrastructure and equipment installed as part of a project funded by the grant.

(3) Applications

(A) Requirements

(i) In general
