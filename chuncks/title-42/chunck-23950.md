### CHAPTER 163— RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COMPETITION, AND INNOVATION
#### § 19222. National research and development strategy for distributed ledger technology
##### (c) Distributed ledger technology research

(1) In general

Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Director of the National Science Foundation shall make awards, on a competitive basis, to institutions of higher education, including minority-serving institutions, or nonprofit organizations (or consortia of such institutions or organizations) to support research, including interdisciplinary research, on distributed ledger technologies, their applications, and other issues that impact or are caused by distributed ledger technologies, which may include research on

(A) the implications on trust, transparency, privacy, accessibility, accountability, and energy consumption of different consensus mechanisms and hardware choices, and approaches for addressing these implications;

(B) approaches for improving the security, privacy, resiliency, interoperability, performance, and scalability of distributed ledger technologies and their applications, which may include decentralized networks;

(C) approaches for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and improving the performance and expressive power of smart contracts;

(D) the implications of quantum computing on applications of distributed ledger technologies, including long-term protection of sensitive information (such as medical or digital property), and techniques to address them;

(E) game theory, mechanism design, and economics underpinning and facilitating the operations and governance of decentralized networks enabled by distributed ledger technologies;

(F) the social behaviors of participants in decentralized networks enabled by distributed ledger technologies;

(G) human-centric design approaches to make distributed ledger technologies and their applications more usable and accessible;

(H) use cases for distributed ledger technologies across various industry sectors and government, including applications pertaining to

(i) digital identity, including trusted identity and identity management;

(ii) digital property rights;

(iii) delivery of public services;

(iv) supply chain transparency;

(v) medical information management;

(vi) inclusive financial services;

(vii) community governance;

(viii) charitable giving;

(ix) public goods funding;

(x) digital credentials;

(xi) regulatory compliance;

(xii) infrastructure resilience, including against natural disasters; and

(xiii) peer-to-peer transactions; and

(I) the social, behavioral, and economic implications associated with the growth of applications of distributed ledger technologies, including decentralization in business, financial, and economic systems.

(2) Accelerating innovation

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall consider continuing to support startups that are in need of funding, would develop in and contribute to the economy of the United States, leverage distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to positively benefit society, and have the potential for commercial viability, through programs like the Small Business Innovation Research program, the Small Business Technology Transfer program, and, as appropriate, other programs that promote broad and diverse participation.

(3) Consideration of national distributed ledger technology research and development strategy

In making awards under paragraph (1), the Director of the National Science Foundation shall take into account the national strategy, as described in subsection (b)(4).

(4) Fundamental research

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall consider continuing to make awards supporting fundamental research in areas related to distributed ledger technologies and their applications, such as applied cryptography and distributed systems.
