#### § 8801. Congressional findings

The Congress finds that

(1) the dependence of the United States on imported petroleum and natural gas must be reduced by all economically and environmentally feasible means, including the use of biomass energy resources; and

(2) a national program for increased production and use of biomass energy that does not impair the Nation’s ability to produce food and fiber on a sustainable basis for domestic and export use must be formulated and implemented within a multiple-use framework.
