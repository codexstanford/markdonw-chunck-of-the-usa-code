#### § 291j–6. Loan guarantee and loan fund
###### (b) If at any time the moneys in the fund are insufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities under this part

(i) to make payments of interest on loans to nonprofit private agencies which he has guaranteed under this part;

(ii) to otherwise comply with guarantees under this part of loans to nonprofit private agencies;

(iii) to make payments of interest subsidies with respect to loans to public agencies which he has made, sold, and guaranteed under this part;

(iv) in the event of default by public agencies to make payments of principal and interest on loans which the Secretary has made, sold, and guaranteed, under this part, to make such payments to the purchaser of such loan;

(v) to repurchase loans to public agencies which have been sold and guaranteed under this part, he is authorized to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but only in such amounts as may be specified from time to time in appropriations Acts. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter, are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. Sums borrowed under this subsection shall be deposited in the fund and redemption of such notes and obligations shall be made by the Secretary from such fund.
