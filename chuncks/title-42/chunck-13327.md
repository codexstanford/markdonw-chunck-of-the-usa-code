(1)

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), individuals who are not low-income persons may serve as volunteers under this part, in accordance with such regulations as the Director shall issue, if such individuals serve without receiving any allowance, stipend, or other financial support under this part except reimbursement for transportation, meals, and out-of-pocket expenses incident to serving under this part.

(B) The regulations issued by the Director to carry out this part (other than any regulations relating to allowances, stipends, and other financial support authorized by subsection (d) to be paid under this part to low-income persons) shall apply to all volunteers under this part, without regard to whether such volunteers are eligible to receive a stipend under subsection (d).

(2)

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each recipient of a grant or contract to carry out a project under this part shall give equal treatment to all volunteers who participate in such project, without regard to whether such volunteers are eligible to receive a stipend under subsection (d).

(B) An individual who is not a low-income person may not become a volunteer under this part if allowing such individual to become a volunteer under this part would prevent a low-income individual from becoming a volunteer under this part or would displace a low-income person from being such a volunteer.

(3) The Director may not take into consideration or require as a condition of receiving a grant or contract to carry out a project under this part, any applicant for such grant or contract

(A) to accept or recruit individuals who are not low-income persons to serve as volunteers under this part; or
