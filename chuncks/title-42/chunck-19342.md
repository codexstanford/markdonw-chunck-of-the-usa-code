(ii) the potential for the technology to have significant market penetration;

(iii) the potential energy efficiency gains or energy supply contributions of the technology;

(iv) potential environmental improvements associated with the technology;

(v) the export potential of the technology;

(vi) the likelihood that the proposal is technically sufficient to achieve the objective of the solicitation;

(vii) the degree to which non-Federal financial participation is involved in the proposal;

(viii) the business and financial history of the proposer or proposers; and

(ix) any other factor the Secretary considers appropriate.

(D) Biofuels energy systems.

(E) Photovoltaics, including utility scale and remote applications.

(F) Solar thermal, including solar water heating.

(G) Wind energy.

(H) High temperature and low temperature geothermal energy.

(I) Fuel cells, including transportation and stationary applications.

(J) Nondefense high-temperature superconducting electricity technology.

(K) Source reduction technology.

(L) Factory-made housing.

(M) Advanced district cooling.

(3) Project selection

The Secretary shall, within 120 days after the closing date established under paragraph (1)(B), select proposals to receive financial assistance under this section. In selecting proposals under this paragraph, the Secretary shall
