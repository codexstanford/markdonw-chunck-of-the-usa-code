(1) Payment incentive

(A) In general

In the case of covered professional services furnished by an eligible professional during a year that is in the period beginning with 2019 and ending with 2024 and for which the professional is a qualifying APM participant with respect to such year, in addition to the amount of payment that would otherwise be made for such covered professional services under this part for such year, there also shall be paid to such professional an amount equal to 5 percent of the estimated aggregate payment amounts for such covered professional services under this part for the preceding year. For purposes of the previous sentence, the payment amount for the preceding year may be an estimation for the full preceding year based on a period of such preceding year that is less than the full year. The Secretary shall establish policies to implement this subparagraph in cases in which payment for covered professional services furnished by a qualifying APM participant in an alternative payment model

(i) is made to an eligible alternative payment entity rather than directly to the qualifying APM participant; or

(ii) is made on a basis other than a fee-for-service basis (such as payment on a capitated basis).

(B) Form of payment

Payments under this subsection shall be made in a lump sum, on an annual basis, as soon as practicable.

(C) Treatment of payment incentive

Payments under this subsection shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining actual expenditures under an alternative payment model and for purposes of determining or rebasing any benchmarks used under the alternative payment model.

(D) Coordination

The amount of the additional payment under this subsection or subsection (m) shall be determined without regard to any additional payment under subsection (m) and this subsection, respectively. The amount of the additional payment under this subsection or subsection (x) shall be determined without regard to any additional payment under subsection (x) and this subsection, respectively.
