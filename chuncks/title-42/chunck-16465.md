##### (q) 12 Analyses of motor vehicle fuel changes and emissions model

(1) Anti-backsliding analysis

(A) Draft analysis

Not later than 4 years after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall publish for public comment a draft analysis of the changes in emissions of air pollutants and air quality due to the use of motor vehicle fuel and fuel additives resulting from implementation of the amendments made by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

(B) Final analysis

After providing a reasonable opportunity for comment but not later than 5 years after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall publish the analysis in final form.

(2) Emissions model

For the purposes of this section, not later than 4 years after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall develop and finalize an emissions model that reflects, to the maximum extent practicable, the effects of gasoline characteristics or components on emissions from vehicles in the motor vehicle fleet during calendar year 2007.

(3) Permeation effects study

(A) In general

Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall conduct a study, and report to Congress the results of the study, on the effects of ethanol content in gasoline on permeation, the process by which fuel molecules migrate through the elastomeric materials (rubber and plastic parts) that make up the fuel and fuel vapor systems of a motor vehicle.

(B) Evaporative emissions

The study shall include estimates of the increase in total evaporative emissions likely to result from the use of gasoline with ethanol content in a motor vehicle, and the fleet of motor vehicles, due to permeation.
