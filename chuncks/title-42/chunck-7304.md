##### (d) Payment for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests

(1) Payment during initial period

(A) In general

In the case of an advanced diagnostic laboratory test for which payment has not been made under the fee schedule under section 1395 l (h) of this title prior to April 1, 2014 , during an initial period of three quarters, the payment amount for the test for such period shall be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test.

(B) Actual list charge

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “actual list charge”, with respect to a laboratory test furnished during such period, means the publicly available rate on the first day at which the test is available for purchase by a private payor.

(2) Special rule for timing of initial reporting

With respect to an advanced diagnostic laboratory test described in paragraph (1)(A), an applicable laboratory shall initially be required to report under subsection (a) not later than the last day of the second quarter of the initial period under such paragraph.

(3) Application of market rates after initial period

Subject to paragraph (4), data reported under paragraph (2) shall be used to establish the payment amount for an advanced diagnostic laboratory test after the initial period under paragraph (1)(A) using the methodology described in subsection (b). Such payment amount shall continue to apply until the year following the next data collection period.

(4) Recoupment if actual list charge exceeds market rate

With respect to the initial period described in paragraph (1)(A), if, after such period, the Secretary determines that the payment amount for an advanced diagnostic laboratory test under paragraph (1)(A) that was applicable during the period was greater than 130 percent of the payment amount for the test established using the methodology described in subsection (b) that is applicable after such period, the Secretary shall recoup the difference between such payment amounts for tests furnished during such period.

(5) Advanced diagnostic laboratory test defined

In this subsection, the term “advanced diagnostic laboratory test” means a clinical diagnostic laboratory test covered under this part that is offered and furnished only by a single laboratory and not sold for use by a laboratory other than the original developing laboratory (or a successor owner) and meets one of the following criteria:

(A) The test is an analysis of multiple biomarkers of DNA, RNA, or proteins combined with a unique algorithm to yield a single patient-specific result.
