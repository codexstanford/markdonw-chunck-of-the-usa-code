##### (j) Definitions

For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) Applicant

The term “applicant” means

(A) any public housing agency that is not designated as troubled pursuant to section 1437d(j)(2) of this title ;

(B) any public housing agency for which a private housing management agent has been selected, or a receiver has been appointed, pursuant to section 1437d(j)(3) of this title ; and

(C) any public housing agency that is designated as troubled pursuant to section 1437d(j)(2) of this title and that

(i) is so designated principally for reasons that will not affect the capacity of the agency to carry out a revitalization program;

(ii) is making substantial progress toward eliminating the deficiencies of the agency; or

(iii) is otherwise determined by the Secretary to be capable of carrying out a revitalization program.

(2) Severely distressed public housing

The term “severely distressed public housing” means a public housing project (or building in a project)

(A) that

(i) requires major redesign, reconstruction or redevelopment, or partial or total demolition, to correct serious deficiencies in the original design (including inappropriately high population density), deferred maintenance, physical deterioration or obsolescence of major systems and other deficiencies in the physical plant of the project;

(ii) is a significant contributing factor to the physical decline of and disinvestment by public and private entities in the surrounding neighborhood;

(iii)

(I) is occupied predominantly by families who are very low-income families with children, are unemployed, and dependent on various forms of public assistance;

(II) has high rates of vandalism and criminal activity (including drug-related criminal activity) in comparison to other housing in the area; or

(III) is lacking in sufficient appropriate transportation, supportive services, economic opportunity, schools, civic and religious institutions, and public services, resulting in severe social distress in the project;

(iv) cannot be revitalized through assistance under other programs, such as the program for capital and operating assistance for public housing under this chapter, or the programs under sections 1437g and 1437 l of this title (as in effect before the effective date under under  2 section 503(a)  2 the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998), because of cost constraints and inadequacy of available amounts; and

(v) in the case of individual buildings, is, in the Secretary’s determination, sufficiently separable from the remainder of the project of which the building is part to make use of the building feasible for purposes of this section; or

(B) that was a project described in subparagraph (A) that has been legally vacated or demolished, but for which the Secretary has not yet provided replacement housing assistance (other than tenant-based assistance).

(3) Supportive services

The term “supportive services” includes all activities that will promote upward mobility, self-sufficiency, and improved quality of life for the residents of the public housing project involved, including literacy training, job training, day care, transportation, and economic development activities.
