### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1320c–4. Right to hearing and judicial review

Any beneficiary who is entitled to benefits under subchapter XVIII, and, subject to section 1320c–3(a)(3)(D) of this title , any practitioner or provider, who is dissatisfied with a determination made by a contracting quality improvement organization in conducting its review responsibilities under this part, shall be entitled to a reconsideration of such determination by the reviewing organization. Where the reconsideration is adverse to the beneficiary and where the matter in controversy is $200 or more, such beneficiary shall be entitled to a hearing by the Secretary (to the same extent as beneficiaries under subchapter II are entitled to a hearing by the Commissioner of Social Security under section 405(b) of this title ). For purposes of the preceding sentence, subsection ( l ) of section 405 of this title shall apply, except that any reference in such subsection to the Commissioner of Social Security or the Social Security Administration shall be deemed a reference to the Secretary or the Department of Health and Human Services, respectively. Where the amount in controversy is $2,000 or more, such beneficiary shall be entitled to judicial review of any final decision relating to a reconsideration described in this subsection.
