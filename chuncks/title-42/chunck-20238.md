### CHAPTER 130— NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING
#### § 12875. Other program requirements
##### (d) Restrictions on resale by homeowners

(1) In general

(A) Transfer permitted

A homeowner under a homeownership program may transfer the homeowner’s ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit, except that a homeownership program may establish restrictions on the resale of units under the program.

(B) Right to purchase

Where a resident management corporation, resident council, or cooperative has jurisdiction over the unit, the corporation, council, or cooperative shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit from the homeowner for the amount specified in a firm contract between the homeowner and a prospective buyer. If such an entity does not have jurisdiction over the unit or elects not to purchase and if the prospective buyer is not a low-income family, the public housing agency or the implementation grant recipient shall have the right to purchase the ownership interest in, or shares representing, the unit for the same amount.

(C) Promissory note required

The homeowner shall execute a promissory note equal to the difference between the market value and the purchase price, payable to the public housing agency or other entity designated in the homeownership plan, together with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note.

(2) 6 years or less

In the case of a transfer within 6 years of the acquisition under the program, the homeownership program shall provide for appropriate restrictions to assure that an eligible family may not receive any undue profit. The plan shall provide for limiting the family’s consideration for its interest in the property to the total of

(A) the contribution to equity paid by the family;

(B) the value, as determined by such means as the Secretary shall determine through regulation, of any improvements installed at the expense of the family during the family’s tenure as owner; and

(C) the appreciated value determined by an inflation allowance at a rate which may be based on a cost-of-living index, an income index, or market index as determined by the Secretary through regulation and agreed to by the purchaser and the entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families (or another entity specified in the approved application), at the time of initial sale, and applied against the contribution to equity. Such an entity may, at the time of initial sale, enter into an agreement with the family to set a maximum amount which this appreciation may not exceed.

(3) 6–20 years

In the case of a transfer during the period beginning 6 years after the acquisition and ending 20 years after the acquisition, the homeownership program shall provide for the recapture by the Secretary or the program of an amount equal to the amount of the declining balance on the note described in paragraph (1)(C).

(4) Use of recaptured funds

Fifty percent of any portion of the net sales proceeds that may not be retained by the homeowner under the plan approved pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the entity that transferred ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families, or another entity specified in the approved application, for use for improvements to the project, business opportunities for low-income families, supportive services related to the homeownership program, additional homeownership opportunities, and other activities approved by the Secretary. The remaining 50 percent shall be returned to the Secretary for use under this part, subject to limitations contained in appropriations Acts. Such entity shall keep and make available to the Secretary all records necessary to calculate accurately payments due the Secretary under this subsection.
