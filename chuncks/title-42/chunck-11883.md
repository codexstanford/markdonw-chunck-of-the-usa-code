##### (b) Unused funds

Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that any amount allotted to a State under part B or C, or part E, for a fiscal year under this section will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Assistant Secretary shall make such allotment available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Assistant Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this subchapter, be regarded as part of such State’s allotment (as determined under subsection (a)) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.
