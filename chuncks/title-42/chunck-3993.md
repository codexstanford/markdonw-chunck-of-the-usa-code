(B) proposes to

(i) carry out a lead reduction project at a public water system or nontransient noncommunity water system that has exceeded the lead action level established by the Administrator under section 300g–1 of this title at any time during the 3-year period preceding the date of submission of the application of the eligible entity; or

(ii) address lead levels in water for human consumption at a school, daycare, or other facility that primarily serves children or other vulnerable human subpopulation described in section 300j–18(a)(1) of this title .

(4) Cost sharing

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the non-Federal share of the total cost of a project funded by a grant under this subsection shall be not less than 20 percent.

(B) Waiver

The Administrator may reduce or eliminate the non-Federal share under subparagraph (A) for reasons of affordability, as the Administrator determines to be appropriate.

(5) Low-income assistance

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), an eligible entity may use a grant provided under this subsection to replace lead service lines, with first priority given to assisting disadvantaged communities based on the affordability criteria established by the applicable State under section 300j–12(d)(3) of this title , low-income homeowners, and landlords or property owners providing housing to low-income renters.

(B) Limitation

The amount of a grant provided to a low-income homeowner under this paragraph shall not exceed the standard cost of replacement of the privately owned portion of the lead service lines.

In carrying out lead service line replacement using a grant under this subsection, an eligible entity

(D) shall notify each customer that a planned replacement of any publicly owned portion of a lead service line that is funded by a grant made under this subsection will not be carried out unless the customer agrees to the simultaneous replacement of the privately owned portion of the lead service line;

(E) shall demonstrate that the eligible entity has considered feasible alternatives for reducing the concentration of lead in drinking water, such as corrosion control; and

(F) shall notify the State of any planned replacement of lead service lines under this program and coordinate, where practicable, with other relevant infrastructure projects.
