#### § 16154. Clean hydrogen research and development program
##### (f) Program goals

(1) Vehicles

For vehicles, the goals of the program are

(A) to enable a commitment by automakers no later than year 2015 to offer safe, affordable, and technically viable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the mass consumer market; and

(B) to enable production, delivery, and acceptance by consumers of model year 2020 hydrogen fuel cell and other hydrogen-powered vehicles that will have, when compared to light duty vehicles in model year 2005

(i) fuel economy that is substantially higher;

(ii) substantially lower emissions of air pollutants; and

(iii) equivalent or improved vehicle fuel system crash integrity and occupant protection.

(2) Hydrogen energy and energy infrastructure

For hydrogen energy and energy infrastructure, the goals of the program are to enable a commitment not later than 2015 that will lead to infrastructure by 2020 that will provide

(A) safe and convenient refueling;

(B) improved overall efficiency;

(C) widespread availability of hydrogen from domestic energy sources through

(i) production, with consideration of emissions levels;

(ii) delivery, including transmission by pipeline and other distribution methods for hydrogen; and

(iii) storage, including storage in surface transportation vehicles;

(D) hydrogen for fuel cells, internal combustion engines, and other energy conversion devices for portable, stationary, micro, critical needs facilities, and transportation applications; and

(E) other technologies consistent with the Department’s plan.

(3) Fuel cells

The goals for fuel cells and their portable, stationary, and transportation applications are to enable

(A) safe, economical, and environmentally sound hydrogen fuel cells;

(B) fuel cells for light duty and other vehicles; and

(C) other technologies consistent with the Department’s plan.
