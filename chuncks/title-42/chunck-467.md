##### (a) Coordination grants to States; assessment grants to political subdivisions

(1) In general

With respect to mosquito control programs to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases (referred to in this section as “control programs”), the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make grants to States for the purpose of

(A) coordinating control programs in the State involved; and

(B) assisting such State in making grants to political subdivisions of the State to conduct assessments to determine the immediate needs in such subdivisions for control programs, including programs to address emerging infectious mosquito-borne diseases, and to develop, on the basis of such assessments, plans for carrying out control programs in the subdivisions or improving existing control programs.

(2) Preference in making grants

In making grants under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give preference to States that have one or more political subdivisions with an incidence, prevalence, or high risk of mosquito-borne disease, or a population of infected mosquitoes, that is substantial relative to political subdivisions in other States.

(3) Certain requirements

A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if

(A) the State involved has developed, or agrees to develop, a plan for coordinating control programs in the State, and the plan takes into account any assessments or plans described in subsection (b)(3) that have been conducted or developed, respectively, by political subdivisions in the State;

(B) in developing such plan, the State consulted or will consult (as the case may be under subparagraph (A)) with political subdivisions in the State that are carrying out or planning to carry out control programs;

(C) the State agrees to monitor control programs in the State in order to ensure that the programs are carried out in accordance with such plan, with priority given to coordination of control programs in political subdivisions described in paragraph (2) that are contiguous;

(D) the State agrees that the State will make grants to political subdivisions as described in paragraph (1)(B), and that such a grant will not exceed $10,000; and

(E) the State agrees that the grant will be used to supplement, and not supplant, State and local funds available for the purpose described in paragraph (1).

(4) Reports to Secretary

A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if the State involved agrees that, promptly after the end of the fiscal year for which the grant is made, the State will submit to the Secretary a report that

(A) describes the activities of the State under the grant; and

(B) contains an evaluation of whether the control programs of political subdivisions in the State were effectively coordinated with each other, which evaluation takes into account any reports that the State received under subsection (b)(5) from such subdivisions.

(5) Number of grants

A State may not receive more than one grant under paragraph (1).
