### CHAPTER 8— LOW-INCOME HOUSING
#### § 1437n. Eligibility for assisted housing
##### (e) Eligibility for assistance based on assets

(1) Limitation on assets

Subject to paragraph (3) and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a dwelling unit assisted under this chapter may not be rented and assistance under this chapter may not be provided, either initially or at each recertification of family income, to any family

(A) whose net family assets exceed $100,000, as such amount is adjusted annually by applying an inflationary factor as the Secretary considers appropriate; or

(B) who has a present ownership interest in, a legal right to reside in, and the effective legal authority to sell, real property that is suitable for occupancy by the family as a residence, except that the prohibition under this subparagraph shall not apply to

(i) any property for which the family is receiving assistance under subsection (y) or ( o )(12) of section 1437f of this title ;

(ii) any person that is a victim of domestic violence; or

(iii) any family that is offering such property for sale.

(2) Net family assets

(A) In general

For purposes of this subsection, the term “net family assets” means, for all members of the household, the net cash value of all assets after deducting reasonable costs that would be incurred in disposing of real property, savings, stocks, bonds, and other forms of capital investment. Such term does not include interests in Indian trust land, equity in property for which the family is receiving assistance under subsection (y) or ( o )(12) of section 1437f of this title , equity accounts in homeownership programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or Family Self Sufficiency accounts.

(B) Exclusions

Such term does not include

(i) the value of personal property, except for items of personal property of significant value, as the Secretary may establish or the public housing agency may determine;

(ii) the value of any retirement account;

(iii) real property for which the family does not have the effective legal authority necessary to sell such property;

(iv) any amounts recovered in any civil action or settlement based on a claim of malpractice, negligence, or other breach of duty owed to a member of the family and arising out of law, that resulted in a member of the family being disabled;

(v) the value of any Coverdell education savings account under section 530 of title 26 or any qualified tuition program under section 529 of such title; and

(vi) such other exclusions as the Secretary may establish.

(C) Trust funds

In cases in which a trust fund has been established and the trust is not revocable by, or under the control of, any member of the family or household, the value of the trust fund shall not be considered an asset of a family if the fund continues to be held in trust. Any income distributed from the trust fund shall be considered income for purposes of section 1437a(b) of this title and any calculations of annual family income, except in the case of medical expenses for a minor.

(3) Self-certification

(A) Net family assets

A public housing agency or owner may determine the net assets of a family, for purposes of this section, based on a certification by the family that the net assets of such family do not exceed $50,000, as such amount is adjusted annually by applying an inflationary factor as the Secretary considers appropriate.

(B) No current real property ownership

A public housing agency or owner may determine compliance with paragraph (1)(B) based on a certification by the family that such family does not have any current ownership interest in any real property at the time the agency or owner reviews the family’s income.

(C) Standardized forms

The Secretary may develop standardized forms for the certifications referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B).

(4) Compliance for public housing dwelling units

When recertifying family income with respect to families residing in public housing dwelling units, a public housing agency may, in the discretion of the agency and only pursuant to a policy that is set forth in the public housing agency plan under section 1437c–1 of this title for the agency, choose not to enforce the limitation under paragraph (1).

(5) Enforcement

When recertifying the income of a family residing in a dwelling unit assisted under this chapter, a public housing agency or owner may choose not to enforce the limitation under paragraph (1) or may establish exceptions to such limitation based on eligibility criteria, but only pursuant to a policy that is set forth in the public housing agency plan under section 1437c–1 of this title for the agency or under a policy adopted by the owner. Eligibility criteria for establishing exceptions may provide for separate treatment based on family type and may be based on different factors, such as age, disability, income, the ability of the family to find suitable alternative housing, and whether supportive services are being provided.

(6) Authority to delay evictions

In the case of a family residing in a dwelling unit assisted under this chapter who does not comply with the limitation under paragraph (1), the public housing agency or project owner may delay eviction or termination of the family based on such noncompliance for a period of not more than 6 months.

(7) Verifying income

(A) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Secretary shall require public housing agencies to require each applicant for, or recipient of, benefits under this chapter to provide authorization by the applicant or recipient (or by any other person whose income or resources are material to the determination of the eligibility of the applicant or recipient for such benefits) for the public housing agency to obtain (subject to the cost reimbursement requirements of section 1115(a) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3415 ]) from any financial institution (within the meaning of section 1101(1) of such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3401(1) ]) any financial record (within the meaning of section 1101(2) of such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3401(2) ]) held by the institution with respect to the applicant or recipient (or any such other person) whenever the public housing agency determines the record is needed in connection with a determination with respect to such eligibility or the amount of such benefits.

(B) Notwithstanding section 1104(a)(1) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3404(a)(1) ], an authorization provided by an applicant or recipient (or any other person whose income or resources are material to the determination of the eligibility of the applicant or recipient) pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall remain effective until the earliest of

(i) the rendering of a final adverse decision on the applicant’s application for eligibility for benefits under this chapter;

(ii) the cessation of the recipient’s eligibility for benefits under this chapter; or

(iii) the express revocation by the applicant or recipient (or such other person referred to in subparagraph (A)) of the authorization, in a written notification to the Secretary.

(C)

(i) An authorization obtained by the public housing agency pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered to meet the requirements of the Right to Financial Privacy Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.] for purposes of section 1103(a) of such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3403(a) ], and need not be furnished to the financial institution, notwithstanding section 1104(a) of such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3404(a) ].

(ii) The certification requirements of section 1103(b) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3403(b) ] shall not apply to requests by the public housing agency pursuant to an authorization provided under this clause.

(iii) A request by the public housing agency pursuant to an authorization provided under this clause is deemed to meet the requirements of section 1104(a)(3) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3404(a)(3) ] and the flush language of section 1102 of such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3402 ].

(iv) The public housing agency shall inform any person who provides authorization pursuant to this paragraph of the duration and scope of the authorization.

(D) If an applicant for, or recipient of, benefits under this chapter (or any such other person referred to in subparagraph (A)) refuses to provide, or revokes, any authorization made by the applicant or recipient for the public housing agency to obtain from any financial institution any financial record, the public housing agency may, on that basis, determine that the applicant or recipient is ineligible for benefits under this subchapter.
