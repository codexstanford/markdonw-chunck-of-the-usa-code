### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396e–1. Premium assistance
##### (d) Voluntary participation

(1) Employers

Participation by an employer in a premium assistance subsidy offered by a State under this section shall be voluntary. An employer may notify a State that it elects to opt-out of being directly paid a premium assistance subsidy on behalf of an employee.

(2) Beneficiaries

No subsidy shall be provided to an individual under this section unless the individual (or the individual’s parent) voluntarily elects to receive such a subsidy. A State may not require such an election as a condition of receipt of medical assistance. A State may not require, as a condition of an individual (or the individual’s parent) being or remaining eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter, that the individual (or the individual’s parent) apply for enrollment in qualified employer-sponsored coverage under this section.

(3) Opt-out permitted for any month

A State shall establish a process for permitting an individual (or the parent of an individual) receiving a premium assistance subsidy to disenroll the individual from the qualified employer-sponsored coverage.
