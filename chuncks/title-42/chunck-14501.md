### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (ff) Ceiling fans and ceiling fan light kits
######## (B) In issuing the standards under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider
######### (i) Large-diameter ceiling fans manufactured on or after January 21, 2020 , shall

(I) not be required to meet minimum ceiling fan efficiency in terms of ratio of the total airflow to the total power consumption as described in the final rule titled “Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Ceiling Fans” (82 Fed. Reg. 6826 ( January 19, 2017 )); and

(II) have a CFEI greater than or equal to

(aa) 1.00 at high speed; and

(bb) 1.31 at 40 percent speed or the nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent speed.

(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “CFEI” means the Fan Energy Index for large-diameter ceiling fans, calculated in accordance with ANSI/AMCA Standard 208–18 titled “Calculation of the Fan Energy Index”, with the following modifications:

(I) Using an Airflow Constant (Q 0 ) of 26,500 cubic feet per minute.

(II) Using a Pressure Constant (P 0 ) of 0.0027 inches water gauge.

(III) Using a Fan Efficiency Constant (η 0 ) of 42 percent.

(7) Section 6297 of this title shall apply to the products covered in paragraphs (1) through (4) beginning on August 8, 2005 , except that any State or local labeling requirement for ceiling fans prescribed or enacted before August 8, 2005 , shall not be preempted until the labeling requirements applicable to ceiling fans established under section 6294 of this title take effect.
