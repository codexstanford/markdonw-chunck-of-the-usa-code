#### § 12852. Assistance for first-time homebuyers
##### (c) Terms of assistance

(1) Security

Assistance payments under this subchapter shall be secured by a lien on the property involved. The lien shall be subordinate to all mortgages existing on the property on the date on which the first assistance payment is made.

(2) Repayment upon sale

Assistance payments under this subchapter shall be repayable from the net proceeds of the sale, without interest, upon the sale of the property for which the assistance payments are made. If the sale results in no net proceeds or the net proceeds are insufficient to repay the amount of the assistance payments in full, the Board of Directors shall release the lien to the extent that the debt secured by the lien remains unpaid.

(3) Repayment upon increased income

If the aggregate annual income of the homebuyer (and family of the homebuyer) assisted under this subchapter exceeds the applicable maximum income allowable under subsection (b)(2) for any 2-year period after such assistance is provided, the Board of Directors may provide for the repayment, on a monthly basis, of all or a portion of such assistance payments, based on the amount of assistance provided and the income of the homebuyer (and family of the homebuyer).

(4) Repayment if property ceases to be principal residence

If the property for which assistance payments are made ceases to be the principal residence of the first-time homebuyer (or the family of the homebuyer), the Board of Directors may provide for the repayment of all or a portion of the assistance payments.

(5) Available assistance

The Trust may make assistance payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) with respect to a single mortgage of an eligible homebuyer.
