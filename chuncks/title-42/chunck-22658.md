#### § 17232. Better energy storage technology
##### (c) Energy storage demonstration projects; pilot grant program

(1) Demonstration projects

Not later than September 30, 2023 , the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enter into agreements to carry out 3 energy storage system demonstration projects, including

(A) at least 1 energy storage system demonstration project designed to further the development of technologies described in clause (v) or (vi) of subsection (b)(2)(A); and

(B) 1 project to demonstrate second-life applications of electric vehicle batteries as aggregated energy storage installations to provide services to the electric grid, in accordance with paragraph (3).

(2) Energy storage pilot grant program

(A) Definition of eligible entity

In this paragraph, the term “eligible entity” means

(i) a State energy office (as defined in section 15821(a) of this title );

(ii) an Indian Tribe (as defined in section 4103 of title 25 ;  1

(iii) a Tribal organization (as defined in section 3765 of title 38 );

(iv) an institution of higher education (as defined in section 1001 of title 20 );

(v) an electric utility, including

(I) an electric cooperative;

(II) a political subdivision of a State, such as a municipally owned electric utility, or any agency, authority, corporation, or instrumentality of a State political subdivision; and

(III) an investor-owned utility; and

(vi) a private energy storage company.

(B) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a competitive grant program under which the Secretary shall award grants to eligible entities to carry out demonstration projects for pilot energy storage systems.

(C) Selection requirements

In selecting eligible entities to receive a grant under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable

(i) ensure regional diversity among eligible entities awarded grants, including ensuring participation of eligible entities that are rural States and States with high energy costs;

(ii) ensure that grants are awarded for demonstration projects that

(I) expand on the existing technology demonstration programs of the Department;

(II) are designed to achieve 1 or more of the objectives described in subparagraph (D); and

(III) inject or withdraw energy from the bulk power system, electric distribution system, building energy system, or microgrid (grid-connected or islanded mode) where the project is located;

(iii) give consideration to proposals from eligible entities for securing energy storage through competitive procurement or contract for service; and

(iv) prioritize projects that leverage matching funds from non-Federal sources.

(D) Objectives

Each demonstration project carried out by a grant awarded under subparagraph (B) shall have 1 or more of the following objectives:

(i) To improve the security of critical infrastructure and emergency response systems.

(ii) To improve the reliability of transmission and distribution systems, particularly in rural areas, including high-energy cost rural areas.

(iii) To optimize transmission or distribution system operation and power quality to defer or avoid costs of replacing or upgrading electric grid infrastructure, including transformers and substations.

(iv) To supply energy at peak periods of demand on the electric grid or during periods of significant variation of electric grid supply.

(v) To reduce peak loads of homes and businesses.

(vi) To improve and advance power conversion systems.

(vii) To provide ancillary services for grid stability and management.

(viii) To integrate renewable energy resource production.

(ix) To increase the feasibility of microgrids (grid-connected or islanded mode).

(x) To enable the use of stored energy in forms other than electricity to support the natural gas system and other industrial processes.

(xi) To integrate fast charging of electric vehicles.

(xii) To improve energy efficiency.

(3) Demonstration of electric vehicle battery second-life applications for grid services

(A) In general

The Secretary shall enter into an agreement to carry out a project to demonstrate second-life applications of electric vehicle batteries as aggregated energy storage installations to provide services to the electric grid.

(B) Purposes

The purposes of the project under subparagraph (A) shall be

(i) to demonstrate power safety and the reliability of the applications demonstrated under the program;

(ii) to demonstrate the ability of electric vehicle batteries

(I) to provide ancillary services for grid stability and management; and

(II) to reduce the peak loads of homes and businesses;

(iii) to extend the useful life of electric vehicle batteries and the components of electric vehicle batteries prior to the collection, recycling, and reprocessing of the batteries and components; and

(iv) to increase acceptance of, and participation in, the use of second-life applications of electric vehicle batteries by utilities.

(C) Priority

In selecting a project to carry out under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall give priority to projects in which the demonstration of the applicable second-life applications is paired with 1 or more facilities that could particularly benefit from increased resiliency and lower energy costs, such as a multi-family affordable housing facility, a senior care facility, and a community health center.

(4) Reports

Not less frequently than once every 3 years for the duration of the programs under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall submit to Congress and make publicly available a report describing the performance of those programs.

(5) No project ownership interest

The Federal Government shall not hold any equity or other ownership interest in any energy storage system that is part of a project under this subsection unless the holding is agreed to by each participant of the project.
