#### § 1395ww. Payments to hospitals for inpatient hospital services
##### (h) Payments for direct graduate medical education costs

(1) Substitution of special payment rules

Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title , instead of any amounts that are otherwise payable under this subchapter with respect to the reasonable costs of hospitals for direct graduate medical education costs, the Secretary shall provide for payments for such costs in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection. In providing for such payments, the Secretary shall provide for an allocation of such payments between part A and part B (and the trust funds established under the respective parts) as reasonably reflects the proportion of direct graduate medical education costs of hospitals associated with the provision of services under each respective part.

(2) Determination of hospital-specific approved FTE resident amounts

The Secretary shall determine, for each hospital with an approved medical residency training program, an approved FTE resident amount for each cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 1985 , as follows:

(A) Determining allowable average cost per FTE resident in a hospital’s base period

The Secretary shall determine, for the hospital’s cost reporting period that began during fiscal year 1984, the average amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter for direct graduate medical education costs of the hospital for each full-time-equivalent resident.

(B) Updating to the first cost reporting period

(i) In general

The Secretary shall update each average amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the percentage increase in the consumer price index during the 12-month cost reporting period described in such subparagraph.

(ii) Exception

The Secretary shall not perform an update under clause (i) in the case of a hospital if the hospital’s reporting period, described in subparagraph (A), began on or after July 1, 1984 , and before October 1, 1984 .

(C) Amount for first cost reporting period

For the first cost reporting period of the hospital beginning on or after July 1, 1985 , the approved FTE resident amount for the hospital is equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (B) increased by 1 percent.

(D) Amount for subsequent cost reporting periods

(i) In general

Except as provided in a subsequent clause, for each subsequent cost reporting period, the approved FTE resident amount for the hospital is equal to the approved FTE resident amount determined under this paragraph for the previous cost reporting period updated, through the midpoint of the period, by projecting the estimated percentage change in the consumer price index during the 12-month period ending at that midpoint, with appropriate adjustments to reflect previous under- or over-estimations under this subparagraph in the projected percentage change in the consumer price index.

(ii) Freeze in update for fiscal years 1994 and 1995

For cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995, the approved FTE resident amount for a hospital shall not be updated under clause (i) for a resident who is not a primary care resident (as defined in paragraph (5)(H)) or a resident enrolled in an approved medical residency training program in obstetrics and gynecology.

(iii) Floor for locality adjusted national average per resident amount

The approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2001 shall not be less than 70 percent, and for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2002 shall not be less than 85 percent, of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for the hospital and period.

(iv) Adjustment in rate of increase for hospitals with FTE approved amount above 140 percent of locality adjusted national average per resident amount

(I) Freeze for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and 2004 through 2013

For a cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2001 or fiscal year 2002 or during the period beginning with fiscal year 2004 and ending with fiscal year 2013, if the approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for the preceding cost reporting period exceeds 140 percent of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for that hospital and period, subject to subclause (III), the approved FTE resident amount for the period involved shall be the same as the approved FTE resident amount for the hospital for such preceding cost reporting period.

(II) 2 percent decrease in update for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005

For the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2003, if the approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for the preceding cost reporting period exceeds 140 percent of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for that hospital and preceding period, the approved FTE resident amount for the period involved shall be updated in the manner described in subparagraph (D)(i) except that, subject to subclause (III), the consumer price index applied for a 12-month period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 2 percentage points.

(III) No adjustment below 140 percent

In no case shall subclause (I) or (II) reduce an approved FTE resident amount for a hospital for a cost reporting period below 140 percent of the locality adjusted national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (E) for such hospital and period.

(E) Determination of locality adjusted national average per resident amount

The Secretary shall determine a locality adjusted national average per resident amount with respect to a cost reporting period of a hospital beginning during a fiscal year as follows:

(i) Determining hospital single per resident amount

The Secretary shall compute for each hospital operating an approved graduate medical education program a single per resident amount equal to the average (weighted by number of full-time equivalent residents, as determined under paragraph (4)) of the primary care per resident amount and the non-primary care per resident amount computed under paragraph (2) for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1997.

(ii) Standardizing per resident amounts

The Secretary shall compute a standardized per resident amount for each such hospital by dividing the single per resident amount computed under clause (i) by an average of the 3 geographic index values (weighted by the national average weight for each of the work, practice expense, and malpractice components) as applied under section 1395w–4(e) of this title for 1999 for the fee schedule area in which the hospital is located.

(iii) Computing of weighted average

The Secretary shall compute the average of the standardized per resident amounts computed under clause (ii) for such hospitals, with the amount for each hospital weighted by the average number of full-time equivalent residents at such hospital (as determined under paragraph (4)).

(iv) Computing national average per resident amount

The Secretary shall compute the national average per resident amount, for a hospital’s cost reporting period that begins during fiscal year 2001, equal to the weighted average computed under clause (iii) increased by the estimated percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the period beginning with the month that represents the midpoint of the cost reporting periods described in clause (i) and ending with the midpoint of the hospital’s cost reporting period that begins during fiscal year 2001.

(v) Adjusting for locality

The Secretary shall compute the product of

(I) the national average per resident amount computed under clause (iv) for the hospital, and

(II) the geographic index value average (described and applied under clause (ii)) for the fee schedule area in which the hospital is located.

(vi) Computing locality adjusted amount

The locality adjusted national per resident amount for a hospital for

(I) the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 2001 is the product computed under clause (v); or

(II) each subsequent cost reporting period is equal to the locality adjusted national per resident amount for the hospital for the previous cost reporting period (as determined under this clause) updated, through the midpoint of the period, by projecting the estimated percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the 12-month period ending at that midpoint.

(F) Treatment of certain hospitals

(i) In the case of a hospital that did not have an approved medical residency training program or was not participating in the program under this subchapter for a cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1984, the Secretary shall, for the first such period for which it has such a residency training program and is participating under this subchapter, provide for such approved FTE resident amount as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, based on approved FTE resident amounts for comparable programs.

(ii) In applying this subparagraph in the case of a hospital that trains residents and has not entered into a GME affiliation agreement (as defined by the Secretary for purposes of paragraph (4)(H)(ii)), on or after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall not establish an FTE resident amount until such time as the Secretary determines that the hospital has trained at least 1.0 full-time-equivalent resident in an approved medical residency training program in a cost reporting period.

(iii) In applying this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning on or after December 27, 2020 , in the case of a hospital that, as of such date, has an approved FTE resident amount based on the training in an approved medical residency program or programs of

(I) less than 1.0 full-time-equivalent resident in any cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1997 , as determined by the Secretary; or

(II) no more than 3.0 full-time-equivalent residents in any cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997 , and before December 27, 2020 , as determined by the Secretary, in lieu of such FTE resident amount the Secretary shall, in accordance with the methodology described in section 413.77(e) of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation), establish a new FTE resident amount if the hospital trains at least 1.0 full-time-equivalent resident (in the case of a hospital described in subclause (I)) or more than 3.0 full-time-equivalent residents (in the case of a hospital described in subclause (II)) in a cost reporting period beginning on or after such date and before the date that is 5 years after such date.

(iv) For purposes of carrying out this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning on or after December 27, 2020 , a hospital shall report full-time-equivalent residents on its cost report for a cost reporting period if the hospital trains at least 1.0 full-time-equivalent residents  9 in an approved medical residency training program or programs in such period.
