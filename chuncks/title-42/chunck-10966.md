The Commission is authorized and directed to produce or to provide for the production of special nuclear material in its own production facilities. To the extent deemed necessary, the Commission is authorized to make, or to continue in effect, contracts with persons obligating them to produce special nuclear material in facilities owned by the Commission. The Commission is also authorized to enter into research and development contracts authorizing the contractor to produce special nuclear material in facilities owned by the Commission to the extent that the production of such special nuclear material may be incident to the conduct of research and development activities under such contracts. Any contract entered into under this section shall contain provisions (1) prohibiting the contractor from subcontracting any part of the work he is obligated to perform under the contract, except as authorized by the Commission; and (2) obligating the contractor (A) to make such reports pertaining to activities under the contract to the Commission as the Commission may require, (B) to submit to inspection by employees of the Commission of all such activities, and (C) to comply with all safety and security regulations which may be prescribed by the Commission. Any contract made under the provisions of this subsection may be made without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41 , upon certification by the Commission that such action is necessary in the interest of the common defense and security, or upon a showing by the Commission that advertising is not reasonably practicable. Partial and advance payments may be made under such contracts.
