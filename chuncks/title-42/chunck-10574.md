#### § 1997c. Intervention in actions
##### (d) Discretionary award of attorney fees; other award provisions unaffected

In any action in which the United States joins as an intervenor under this section, the court may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee against the United States as part of the costs. Nothing in this subsection precludes the award of attorney’s fees available under any other provisions of the United States Code.
