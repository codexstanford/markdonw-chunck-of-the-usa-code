### CHAPTER 68— DISASTER RELIEF
#### § 5135. Grants to entities for establishment of hazard mitigation revolving loan funds
##### (f) Use of funds

(1) Types of assistance

Amounts deposited in an entity loan fund, including loan repayments and interest earned on such amounts, may be used

(A) to make loans, on the condition that

(i) such loans are made at an interest rate of not more than 1 percent;

(ii) annual principal and interest payments will commence not later than 1 year after completion of any project and all loans made under this subparagraph will be fully amortized

(I) not later than 20 years after the date on which the project is completed; or

(II) for projects in a low-income geographic area, not later than 30 years after the date on which the project is completed and not longer than the expected design life of the project;

(iii) the loan recipient of a loan under this subparagraph establishes a dedicated source of revenue for repayment of the loan;

(iv) the loan recipient of a loan under this subparagraph has a hazard mitigation plan that has been approved by the Administrator; and

(v) the entity loan fund will be credited with all payments of principal and interest on all loans made under this subparagraph;

(B) for mitigation efforts, in addition to mitigation planning under section 5165 of this title not to exceed 10 percent of the capitalization grants made to the participating entity in a fiscal year;

(C) for the reasonable costs of administering the fund and conducting activities under this section, except that such amounts shall not exceed $100,000 per year, 2 percent of the capitalization grants made to the participating entity in a fiscal year, or 1 percent of the value of the entity loan fund, whichever amount is greatest, plus the amount of any fees collected by the entity for such purpose regardless of the source; and

(D) to earn interest on the entity loan fund.

(2) Prohibition on determination that loan is a duplication

In carrying out this section, the Administrator may not determine that a loan is a duplication of assistance or programs under this chapter.

(3) Projects and activities eligible for assistance

Except as provided in this subsection, a participating entity may use funds in the entity loan fund to provide financial assistance for projects or activities that mitigate the impacts of natural hazards including

(A) drought and prolonged episodes of intense heat;

(B) severe storms, including hurricanes, tornados, wind storms, cyclones, and severe winter storms;

(C) wildfires;

(D) earthquakes;

(E) flooding, including the construction, repair, or replacement of a non-Federal levee or other flood control structure, provided that the Administrator, in consultation with the Army Corps of Engineers (if appropriate), requires an eligible entity to determine that such levee or structure is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices and standards equivalent to the purpose for which such levee or structure is intended;

(F) shoreline erosion;

(G) high water levels; and

(H) storm surges.

(4) Zoning and land use planning changes

A participating entity may use not more than 10 percent of a capitalization grant under this section to enable units of local government to implement zoning and land use planning changes focused on

(A) the development and improvement of zoning and land use codes that incentivize and encourage low-impact development, resilient wildland-urban interface land management and development, natural infrastructure, green stormwater management, conservation areas adjacent to floodplains, implementation of watershed or greenway master plans, and reconnection of floodplains;

(B) the study and creation of agricultural risk compensation districts where there is a desire to remove or set-back levees protecting highly developed agricultural land to mitigate for flooding, allowing agricultural producers to receive compensation for assuming greater flood risk that would alleviate flood exposure to population centers and areas with critical national infrastructure;

(C) the study and creation of land use incentives that reward developers for greater reliance on low impact development stormwater best management practices, exchange density increases for increased open space and improvement of neighborhood catch basins to mitigate urban flooding, reward developers for including and augmenting natural infrastructure adjacent to and around building projects without reliance on increased sprawl, and reward developers for addressing wildfire ignition; and

(D) the study and creation of an erosion response plan that accommodates river, lake, forest, plains, and ocean shoreline retreating or bluff stabilization due to increased flooding and disaster impacts.

(5) Establishing and carrying out building code enforcement

A participating entity may use capitalization grants under this section to enable units of local government to establish and carry out the latest published editions of relevant building codes, specifications, and standards for the purpose of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the building’s users against disasters and natural hazards.

(6) Administrative and technical costs

For each fiscal year, a participating entity may use the amount described in paragraph (1)(C) to

(A) pay the reasonable costs of administering the programs under this section, including the cost of establishing an entity loan fund; and

(B) provide technical assistance to recipients of financial assistance from the entity loan fund, on the condition that such technical assistance does not exceed 5 percent of the capitalization grant made to such entity.

(7) Limitation for single projects

A participating entity may not provide an amount equal to or more than $5,000,000 to a single hazard mitigation project.

(8) Requirements

For fiscal year 2022 and each fiscal year thereafter, the requirements of subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40 shall apply to the construction of projects carried out in whole or in part with assistance made available by an entity loan fund authorized by this section.
