##### (d) Interagency working group

(1) Establishment

(A) There shall be established an interagency working group that, in consultation with the representative industry groups and relevant agency heads, shall make recommendations to coordinate the actions and programs of the Federal Government affecting exports of renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services. The interagency working group shall establish a program to inform foreign countries of the benefits of policies that would increase energy efficiency or would allow facilities that use renewable energy to compete effectively with producers of energy from nonrenewable sources.

(B) There shall be established an Interagency Working Subgroup on Renewable Energy and an Interagency Working Subgroup on Energy Efficiency that shall, in consultation with representative industry groups, nonprofit organizations, and relevant Federal agencies, make recommendations to coordinate the actions and programs of the Federal Government to promote the export of domestic renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services, respectively.

(C) The Secretary of Energy, or the Secretary’s designee, shall chair the interagency working group and each subgroup established under this paragraph. The Administrator of the Agency for International Development and the Secretary of Commerce, or their designees, shall be members of both subgroups established under this paragraph. The Secretary shall provide staff for carrying out the functions of the interagency working group and each subgroup established under this paragraph. The heads of appropriate agencies may detail such personnel and may furnish such services to such group and subgroups, with or without reimbursement, as may be necessary to carry out their functions.

(2) Duties of the interagency working subgroups

(A) The interagency working subgroups established under paragraph (1)(B), through the member agencies of the interagency working group, shall promote the development and application in foreign countries of renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services, respectively, that

(i) reduce dependence on unreliable sources of energy by encouraging the use of sustainable biomass, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services; and

(ii) use hybrid fossil-renewable energy systems.

(B) In addition, the interagency working subgroups shall explore mechanisms for assisting domestic firms, particularly small businesses, with the export of their renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services and with the identification of potential projects.

(3) Training and assistance

The interagency working subgroups shall encourage the member agencies of the interagency working group to

(A) provide technical training and education for international development personnel and local users in their own country;

(B) provide financial and technical assistance to nonprofit institutions that support the marketing and export efforts of domestic companies that provide renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services;

(C) develop environmentally sustainable renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in foreign countries;

(D) provide technical assistance and training materials to loan officers of the World Bank, international lending institutions, commercial and energy attaches at embassies of the United States and other appropriate personnel in order to provide information about renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services to foreign governments or other potential project sponsors;

(E) support, through financial incentives, private sector efforts to commercialize and export renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services; and

(F) augment budgets for trade and development programs in order to support pre-feasibility or feasibility studies for projects that utilize renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services.

(4) Study of export promotion practices

The interagency working group shall conduct a study of subsidies, incentives, and policies that foreign countries use to promote exports of their own renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and products. Such study shall also identify foreign trade barriers to the import of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and products produced in the United States. The interagency working group shall report to the appropriate committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate the results of such study within 18 months after October 24, 1992 .
