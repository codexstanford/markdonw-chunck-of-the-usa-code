(1) Medical necessity as precondition

With respect to compliance with the agreement made under subsection (a), a State may expend a grant under section 300x–21 of this title to provide inpatient hospital services as treatment for substance use disorders only if it has been determined, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Secretary, that such treatment is a medical necessity for the individual involved, and that the individual cannot be effectively treated in a community-based, nonhospital, residential program of treatment.

In the case of an individual for whom a grant under section 300x–21 of this title is expended to provide inpatient hospital services described in paragraph (1), a funding agreement for the grant for the State involved is that the daily rate of payment provided to the hospital for providing the services to the individual will not exceed the comparable daily rate provided for community-based, nonhospital, residential programs of treatment for substance abuse.
