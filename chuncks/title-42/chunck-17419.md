#### § 8626a. Incentive program for leveraging non-Federal resources
##### (c) Formula for distribution of amounts

(1) Distribution of amounts made available under this section shall be based on a formula developed by the Secretary that is designed to take into account the success in leveraging existing appropriations in the preceding fiscal year as measured under subsection (d). Such formula shall take into account the size of the allocation of the State under this subchapter and the ratio of leveraged resources to such allocation.

(2) A State may expend funds allocated under this subchapter as are necessary, not to exceed 0.08 percent of such allocation or $35,000 each fiscal year, whichever is greater, to identify, develop, and demonstrate leveraging programs. Funds allocated under this section shall only be used for increasing or maintaining benefits to households.
