#### § 1395p. Enrollment periods
##### (h) Waiver of enrollment period requirements where individual’s rights were prejudiced by administrative error or inaction

In any case where the Secretary finds that an individual’s enrollment or nonenrollment in the insurance program established by this part or part A pursuant to section 1395i–2 of this title is unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous and is the result of the error, misrepresentation, or inaction of an officer, employee, or agent of the Federal Government, or its instrumentalities, the Secretary may take such action (including the designation for such individual of a special initial or subsequent enrollment period, with a coverage period determined on the basis thereof and with appropriate adjustments of premiums) as may be necessary to correct or eliminate the effects of such error, misrepresentation, or inaction.
