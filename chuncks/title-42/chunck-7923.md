##### (c) Enrollment in plan; duties of organization to enrollees
######## (A) The organization must provide to members enrolled under this section, through providers and other persons that meet the applicable requirements of this subchapter and part A of subchapter XI

(i) only those services covered under parts A and B of this subchapter, for those members entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B, or

(ii) only those services covered under part B, for those members enrolled only under such part, which are available to individuals residing in the geographic area served by the organization, except that (I) the organization may provide such members with such additional health care services as the members may elect, at their option, to have covered, and (II) in the case of an organization with a risk-sharing contract, the organization may provide such members with such additional health care services as the Secretary may approve. The Secretary shall approve any such additional health care services which the organization proposes to offer to such members, unless the Secretary determines that including such additional services will substantially discourage enrollment by covered individuals with the organization.
