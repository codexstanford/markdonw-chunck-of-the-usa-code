##### (e) Use of fees

(1) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(A) the use of taxpayer-funded award fees should be transparent and explicable; and

(B) the Foundation should implement an award fee policy that ensures more transparency and accountability in the funding of necessary and appropriate expenses directly related to the construction and operation of major multi-user research facilities.

(2) Reporting and recordkeeping

The Director of the Foundation shall establish guidelines for awardees regarding inappropriate expenditures associated with all fee types used in cooperative agreements, including for alcoholic beverages, lobbying, meals or entertainment for non-business purposes, non-business travel, and any other purpose the Director determines is inappropriate.
