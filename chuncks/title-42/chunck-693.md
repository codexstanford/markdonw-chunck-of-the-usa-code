The Secretary may make grants, for a period of not to exceed 1 year, for the costs of the operation of public and nonprofit private entities which provide health services to medically underserved populations but with respect to which the Secretary is unable to make each of the determinations required by subsection (k)(3). The Secretary shall not make a grant under this paragraph unless the applicant provides assurances to the Secretary that within 120 days of receiving grant funding for the operation of the health center, the applicant will submit, for approval by the Secretary, an implementation plan to meet the requirements of subsection (k)(3). The Secretary may extend such 120-day period for achieving compliance upon a demonstration of good cause by the health center.

(C) Operation of networks

The Secretary may make grants to health centers that receive assistance under this section, or at the request of the health centers, directly to a network that is at least majority controlled and, as applicable, at least majority owned by such health centers receiving assistance under this section, for the costs associated with the operation of such network including

(i) the purchase or lease of equipment, which may include data and information systems (including the costs of amortizing the principal of, and paying the interest on, loans for equipment);

(ii) the provision of training and technical assistance; and

(iii) other activities that

(I) reduce costs associated with the provision of health services;

(II) improve access to, and availability of, health services provided to individuals served by the centers;

(III) enhance the quality and coordination of health services; or

(IV) improve the health status of communities.

(2) Use of funds

The costs for which a grant may be made under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) may include the costs of acquiring and leasing buildings and equipment (including the costs of amortizing the principal of, and paying interest on, loans), and the costs of providing training related to the provision of required primary health services and additional health services and to the management of health center programs.

(3) Construction

The Secretary may award grants which may be used to pay the costs associated with expanding and modernizing existing buildings or constructing new buildings (including the costs of amortizing the principal of, and paying the interest on, loans) for projects approved prior to October 1, 1996 .

(4) Limitation

Not more than two grants may be made under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) for the same entity.

(5) Amount

(A) In general

The amount of any grant made in any fiscal year under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) to a health center shall be determined by the Secretary, but may not exceed the amount by which the costs of operation of the center in such fiscal year exceed the total of

(i) State, local, and other operational funding provided to the center; and

(ii) the fees, premiums, and third-party reimbursements, which the center may reasonably be expected to receive for its operations in such fiscal year.

(B) Networks

The total amount of grant funds made available for any fiscal year under paragraph (1)(C) to a health center or to a network shall be determined by the Secretary, but may not exceed 2 percent of the total amount appropriated under this section for such fiscal year.

(C) Payments

Payments under grants under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) shall be made in advance or by way of reimbursement and in such installments as the Secretary finds necessary and adjustments may be made for overpayments or underpayments.

(D) Use of nongrant funds

Nongrant funds described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), including any such funds in excess of those originally expected, shall be used as permitted under this section, and may be used for such other purposes as are not specifically prohibited under this section if such use furthers the objectives of the project.

(6) New access points and expanded services

(A) Approval of new access points

(i) In general

The Secretary may approve applications for grants under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) to establish new delivery sites.

(ii) Special consideration

In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary may give special consideration to applicants that have demonstrated the new delivery site will be located within a sparsely populated area, or an area which has a level of unmet need that is higher relative to other applicants.

(iii) Consideration of applications

In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary shall approve applications for grants in such a manner that the ratio of the medically underserved populations in rural areas which may be expected to use the services provided by the applicants involved to the medically underserved populations in urban areas which may be expected to use the services provided by the applicants is not less than two to three or greater than three to two.

(iv) Service area overlap

If in carrying out clause (i) the applicant proposes to serve an area that is currently served by another health center funded under this section, the Secretary may consider whether the award of funding to an additional health center in the area can be justified based on the unmet need for additional services within the catchment area.

(B) Approval of expanded service applications

(i) In general

The Secretary may approve applications for grants under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) to expand the capacity of the applicant to provide required primary health services described in subsection (b)(1) or additional health services described in subsection (b)(2).

(ii) Priority expansion projects

In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary may give special consideration to expanded service applications that seek to address emerging public health or behavioral health, mental health, or substance abuse issues through increasing the availability of additional health services described in subsection (b)(2) in an area in which there are significant barriers to accessing care.

(iii) Consideration of applications

In carrying out clause (i), the Secretary shall approve applications for grants in such a manner that the ratio of the medically underserved populations in rural areas which may be expected to use the services provided by the applicants involved to the medically underserved populations in urban areas which may be expected to use the services provided by such applicants is not less than two to three or greater than three to two.
