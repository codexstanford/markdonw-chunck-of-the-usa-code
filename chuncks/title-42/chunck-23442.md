#### § 18743. Critical minerals mining and recycling research
##### (c) Critical minerals interagency subcommittee

(1) In general

In order to support supply chain resiliency, the Critical Minerals Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council (referred to in this subsection as the “Subcommittee”) shall coordinate Federal science and technology efforts to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals to the United States.

(2) Purposes

The purposes of the Subcommittee shall be

(A) to advise and assist the National Science and Technology Council, including the Committee on Homeland and National Security of the National Science and Technology Council, on United States policies, procedures, and plans relating to critical minerals, including

(i) Federal research, development, and deployment efforts to optimize methods for extractions, concentration, separation, and purification of conventional, secondary, and unconventional sources of critical minerals, including research that prioritizes end-to-end integration of mining and recycling techniques and the end-use target for critical minerals;

(ii) efficient use and reuse of critical minerals, including recycling technologies for critical minerals and the reclamation of critical minerals from components, such as spent batteries;

(iii) addressing the technology transitions between research or lab-scale mining and recycling and commercialization of these technologies;

(iv) the critical minerals workforce of the United States; and

(v) United States private industry investments in innovation and technology transfer from federally funded science and technology;

(B) to identify emerging opportunities, stimulate international cooperation, and foster the development of secure and reliable supply chains of critical minerals, including activities relating to the reuse of critical minerals via recycling;

(C) to ensure the transparency of information and data related to critical minerals; and

(D) to provide recommendations on coordination and collaboration among the research, development, and deployment programs and activities of Federal agencies to promote a secure and reliable supply of critical minerals necessary to maintain national security, economic well-being, and industrial production.

(3) Responsibilities

In carrying out paragraphs (1) and (2), the Subcommittee may, taking into account the findings and recommendations of relevant advisory committees

(A) provide recommendations on how Federal agencies may improve the topographic, geologic, and geophysical mapping of the United States and improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of the resulting and existing data, to the extent permitted by law and subject to appropriate limitation for purposes of privacy and security;

(B) assess the progress toward developing critical minerals recycling and reprocessing technologies;

(C) assess the end-to-end lifecycle of critical minerals, including for mining, usage, recycling, and end-use material and technology requirements;

(D) examine, and provide recommendations for, options for accessing and developing critical minerals through investment and trade with allies and partners of the United States;

(E) evaluate and provide recommendations to incentivize the development and use of advances in science and technology in the private industry;

(F) assess the need for, and make recommendations to address, the challenges the United States critical minerals supply chain workforce faces, including

(i) aging and retiring personnel and faculty;

(ii) public perceptions about the nature of mining and mineral processing; and

(iii) foreign competition for United States talent;

(G) develop, and update as necessary, a strategic plan to guide Federal programs and activities to enhance

(i) scientific and technical capabilities across critical mineral supply chains, including a roadmap that identifies key research and development needs and coordinates ongoing activities for source diversification, more efficient use, recycling, and substitution for critical minerals; and

(ii) cross-cutting mining science, data science techniques, materials science, manufacturing science and engineering, computational modeling, and environmental health and safety research and development; and

(H) report to the appropriate committees of Congress on activities and findings under this subsection.

(4) Mandatory responsibilities

In carrying out paragraphs (1) and (2), the Subcommittee shall, taking into account the findings and recommendations of relevant advisory committees, identify and evaluate Federal policies and regulations that restrict the mining of critical minerals.
