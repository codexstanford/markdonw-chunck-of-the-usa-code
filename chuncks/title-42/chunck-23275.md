### CHAPTER 161— DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
#### § 18642. Advanced scientific computing research
##### (d) Applied mathematics and software development for high-end computing systems and computer sciences research

(1) In general

The Director shall carry out activities to develop, test, and support

(A) mathematics, statistics, and algorithms for modeling complex systems relevant to the missions of the Department, including on advanced computing architectures; and

(B) tools, languages, programming environments, and operations for high-end computing systems (as defined in section 5541 of title 15 ).

(2) Portfolio balance

(A) In general

The Director shall maintain a balanced portfolio within the advanced scientific computing research and development program established under section 976 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( 42 U.S.C. 16316 )  1 that supports robust investment in

(i) applied mathematical, computational, and computer sciences research needs relevant to the mission of the Department, including foundational areas that are critical to the advancement of energy sciences and technologies and new and emerging computing technologies; and

(ii) associated high-performance computing hardware and facilities.

(B) Exascale ecosystem sustainment

(i) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that the Exascale Computing Project has successfully created a broad ecosystem that provides shared software packages, novel evaluation systems, and applications relevant to the science and engineering requirements of the Department, and that such products must be maintained and improved in order that the full potential of the deployed systems can be continuously realized.

(ii) Sustainment

The Secretary shall seek to sustain and evolve the ecosystem described in clause (i) to ensure that the exascale software stack and other research software will continue to be maintained, hardened, and otherwise optimized for long-term use on exascale systems and beyond and reliable availability to the user community.
