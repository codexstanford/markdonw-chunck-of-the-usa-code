#### § 2065. Improving the reliability of domestic medical isotope supply
##### (a) Medical isotope development projects

(1) In general

The Secretary shall carry out a technology-neutral program

(A) to evaluate and support projects for the production in the United States, without the use of highly enriched uranium, of significant quantities of molybdenum-99 for medical uses;

(B) to be carried out in cooperation with non-Federal entities; and

(C) the costs of which shall be shared in accordance with section 16352 of this title .

(2) Criteria

Projects shall be evaluated against the following primary criteria:

(A) The length of time necessary for the proposed project to begin production of molybdenum-99 for medical uses within the United States.

(B) The capability of the proposed project to produce a significant percentage of United States demand for molybdenum-99 for medical uses.

(C) The capability of the proposed project to produce molybdenum-99 in a cost-effective manner.

(D) The cost of the proposed project.

(3) Exemption

An existing reactor in the United States fueled with highly enriched uranium shall not be disqualified from the program if the Secretary determines that

(A) there is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel, enriched in the isotope U–235 to less than 20 percent, that can be used in that reactor;

(B) the reactor operator has provided assurances that, whenever an alternative nuclear reactor fuel, enriched in the isotope U–235 to less than 20 percent, can be used in that reactor, it will use that alternative in lieu of highly enriched uranium; and

(C) the reactor operator has provided a current report on the status of its efforts to convert the reactor to an alternative nuclear reactor fuel enriched in the isotope U–235 to less than 20 percent, and an anticipated schedule for completion of conversion.

(4) Public participation and review

The Secretary shall

(A) develop a program plan and annually update the program plan through public workshops; and

(B) use the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee to conduct triennial reviews of the progress made in achieving the program goals and make recommendations to improve program effectiveness.
