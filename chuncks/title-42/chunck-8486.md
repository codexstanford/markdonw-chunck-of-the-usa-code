### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396o–1. State option for alternative premiums and cost sharing
##### (d) Enforceability of premiums and other cost sharing

(1) Premiums

Notwithstanding section 1396 o (c)(3) of this title and section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title , a State may, at its option, condition the provision of medical assistance for an individual upon prepayment of a premium authorized to be imposed under this section, or may terminate eligibility for such medical assistance on the basis of failure to pay such a premium but shall not terminate eligibility of an individual for medical assistance under this subchapter on the basis of failure to pay any such premium until such failure continues for a period of not less than 60 days. A State may apply the previous sentence for some or all groups of beneficiaries as specified by the State and may waive payment of any such premium in any case where the State determines that requiring such payment would create an undue hardship.

(2) Cost sharing

Notwithstanding section 1396 o (e) of this title or any other provision of law, a State may permit a provider participating under the State plan to require, as a condition for the provision of care, items, or services to an individual entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter for such care, items, or services, the payment of any cost sharing authorized to be imposed under this section with respect to such care, items, or services. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing a provider from reducing or waiving the application of such cost sharing on a case-by-case basis.
