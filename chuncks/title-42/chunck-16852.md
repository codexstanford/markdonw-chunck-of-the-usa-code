(iii) meet such other requirements as the Administrator shall prescribe.

(3) United States Geological Survey

(B) work with officials of State and local governments to ensure that they are knowledgeable about the specific seismic risks in their areas;

(C) develop standard procedures, in consultation with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for issuing earthquake alerts and early warnings;

(D) issue when necessary and feasible, and notify the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and State and local officials, an alert and an earthquake warning;

(E) operate, including the National Earthquake Information Center, a forum for the international exchange of earthquake information which shall

(i) promote the exchange of information on earthquake research and earthquake preparedness between the United States and other nations;

(ii) maintain a library containing selected reports, research papers, and data produced through the Program;

(iii) answer requests from other nations for information on United States earthquake research and earthquake preparedness programs; and

(iv) direct foreign requests to the agency involved in the Program which is best able to respond to the request;

(F) operate a National Seismic System;

(G) support regional seismic networks, which shall complement the National Seismic Network; and  1

(H) work with the National Science Foundation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research to effectively use existing testing facilities and laboratories (in existence at the time of the development of the plan), upgrade facilities and equipment as needed, and integrate new, innovative testing approaches to the research infrastructure in a systematic manner. 6

(I) work with other Program agencies to coordinate Program activities with similar earthquake hazards reduction efforts in other countries, to ensure that the Program benefits from relevant information and advances in those countries;

(J) maintain suitable seismic hazard maps and data in support of building codes for structures and lifeline infrastructure, including additional maps needed for performance-based design approaches; and

(K) support the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the completion of programmatic goals.

(4) National Science Foundation

(A) In general
