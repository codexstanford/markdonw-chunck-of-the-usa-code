(ii) direct patient care and service expansions to fill identified or documented gaps within an integrated delivery system.

The following are examples of purposes for which a grantee may use grant funds under this section, when such use meets the conditions stated in subparagraph (A):

(i) Increases in outreach activities and closing gaps in health care service.

(v) Recruitment, training, and compensation of necessary personnel.

(vi) Acquisition of technology for the purpose of coordinating care.

(vii) Improvements to provider communication, including implementation of shared information systems or shared clinical systems.

(ix) Development of specific prevention and disease management tools and processes.

(x) Translation services.
