##### (b) Purpose

It is the purpose of this subchapter to facilitate the elimination of barriers, including geographic barriers, to adoption and to provide permanent and loving home environments for children who would benefit from adoption, particularly older children, minority children, and children with special needs, including disabled infants with life-threatening conditions, by providing a mechanism to

(1) promote quality standards for adoption services, pre-placement, post-placement, and post-legal adoption counseling, and standards to protect the rights of children in need of adoption;

(2) maintain an Internet-based national adoption information exchange system to

(A) bring together children who would benefit from adoption and qualified prospective adoptive parents who are seeking such children;

(B) conduct national recruitment efforts in order to reach prospective parents for children awaiting adoption; and

(C) connect placement agencies, prospective adoptive parents, and adoptive parents to resources designed to reduce barriers to adoption, support adoptive families, and ensure permanency; and

(3) demonstrate expeditious ways to free children for adoption for whom it has been determined that adoption is the appropriate plan.
