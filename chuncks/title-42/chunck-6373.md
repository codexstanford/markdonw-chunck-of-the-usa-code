#### § 1104. Unemployment Trust Fund
##### (e) Separate book accounts

The Fund shall be invested as a single fund, but the Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain a separate book account for each State agency, the employment security administration account, the Federal unemployment account, the railroad unemployment insurance account, and the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund and shall credit quarterly (on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year) to each account, on the basis of the average daily balance of such account, a proportionate part of the earnings of the Fund for the quarter ending on such date. For the purpose of this subsection, the average daily balance shall be computed

(2) in the case of the Federal unemployment account

(A) by adding to the amount in the account the aggregate of the reductions under paragraph (1), and
