### CHAPTER 65— NOISE CONTROL
#### § 4916. Railroad noise emission standards
##### (c) High-speed train noise emissions

(1) In general

The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Administrator, may prescribe regulations governing railroad-related noise emission standards for trains operating on the general railroad system of transportation at speeds exceeding 160 miles per hour, including noise related to magnetic levitation systems and other new technologies not traditionally associated with railroads.

(2) Factors in rulemaking

The regulations prescribed pursuant to paragraph (1) may

(A) consider variances in maximum pass-by noise with respect to the speed of the equipment;

(B) account for current engineering best practices; and

(C) encourage the use of noise mitigation techniques to the extent reasonable if the benefits exceed the costs.

(3) Conventional-speed trains

Railroad-related noise regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall continue to govern noise emissions from the operation of trains, including locomotives and rail cars, when operating at speeds not exceeding 160 miles per hour.
