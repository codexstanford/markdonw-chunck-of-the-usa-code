#### § 503. State laws
##### (j) Worker profiling

(1) The State agency charged with the administration of the State law shall establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular compensation that

(A) identifies which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular compensation and will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment;

(B) refers claimants identified pursuant to subparagraph (A) to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, available under any State or Federal law;

(C) collects follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and the employment outcomes for such claimants subsequent to receiving such services and utilizes such information in making identifications pursuant to subparagraph (A); and

(D) meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.

(2) Whenever the Secretary of Labor, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency charged with the administration of the State law, finds that there is a failure to comply substantially with the requirements of paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor shall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the State until he is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure. Until the Secretary of Labor is so satisfied, he shall make no further certification to the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to such State.
