#### § 6383. Accounting practices
##### (b) Consultation with Secretary, Government Accountability Office and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; rules; reliance on practices developed by Financial Accounting Standards Board; opportunity to submit written comment

In carrying out its responsibilities under subsection (a), the Securities and Exchange Commission shall

(1) consult with the Secretary, the Government Accountability Office, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to accounting practices to be developed under subsection (a), and

(2) have authority to prescribe rules applicable to persons engaged in the production of crude oil or natural gas, or make effective by recognition, or by other appropriate means indicating a determination to rely on, accounting practices developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, if the Securities and Exchange Commission is assured that such practice will be observed by persons engaged in the production of crude oil or natural gas to the same extent as would result if the Securities and Exchange Commission had prescribed such practices by rule. The Securities and Exchange Commission shall afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written comments with respect to whether it should exercise its discretion to recognize or otherwise rely on such accounting practice in lieu of prescribing such practices by rule and may extend the 24-month period referred to in subsection (a) as it determines may be necessary to allow for a meaningful comment period with respect to such determination.
