### CHAPTER 8— LOW-INCOME HOUSING
#### § 1437t. Authority to convert public housing to vouchers
##### (b) Conversion assessment

(1) In general

To convert public housing under this section, a public housing agency shall conduct an assessment of the public housing that includes

(A) a cost analysis that demonstrates whether or not the cost (both on a net present value basis and in terms of new budget authority requirements) of providing tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title for the same families in substantially similar dwellings over the same period of time is less expensive than continuing public housing assistance in the public housing project for the remaining useful life of the project;

(B) an analysis of the market value of the public housing project both before and after rehabilitation, and before and after conversion;

(C) an analysis of the rental market conditions with respect to the likely success of the use of tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title in that market for the specific residents of the public housing project, including an assessment of the availability of decent and safe dwellings renting at or below the payment standard established for tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title by the agency;

(D) the impact of the conversion to tenant-based assistance under this section on the neighborhood in which the public housing project is located; and

(E) a plan that identifies actions, if any, that the public housing agency would take with regard to converting any public housing project or projects (or portions thereof) of the public housing agency to tenant-based assistance.

(2) Timing

Not later than 2 years after the effective date under section 503(a) of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, each public housing agency shall conduct an assessment under paragraph (1) or (3) of the status of each public housing project owned by such agency and shall submit to the Secretary such assessment. A public housing agency may otherwise undertake an assessment under this subsection at any time and for any public housing project (or portion thereof) owned by the agency. A public housing agency may update a previously conducted assessment for a project (or portion thereof) for purposes of compliance with the one-year limitation under subsection (c).

(3) Streamlined assessment

At the discretion of the Secretary or at the request of a public housing agency, the Secretary may waive any or all of the requirements of paragraph (1) or (3) or otherwise require a streamlined assessment with respect to any public housing project or class of public housing projects.
