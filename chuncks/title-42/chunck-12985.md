##### (b) Adoption, incorporation by reference, and use of documents

(1) Use of existing documents

(A) In general

On the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency shall consider and, as appropriate, adopt or incorporate by reference, the analysis and documentation that has been prepared for a covered project under the laws and procedures of a State or Indian Tribe (as defined in section 5130 of title 25 ) as the documentation, or part of the documentation, required to complete an environmental review for the covered project, if the analysis and documentation were, as determined by the lead agency in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, developed pursuant to laws and procedures of that State or Indian Tribe (as so defined) that are of equal or greater rigor to each applicable Federal law and procedure, and prepared under circumstances that allowed for opportunities for public participation and consideration of alternatives, environmental consequences, and other required analyses that are substantially equivalent to what would have been available had the documents and analysis been prepared by a Federal agency pursuant to NEPA.

(B) Guidance by CEQ

The Council on Environmental Quality may issue guidance to carry out this subsection.

(2) NEPA obligations

An environmental document adopted under paragraph (1) or a document that includes documentation incorporated under paragraph (1) may serve as the documentation required for an environmental review or a supplemental environmental review required to be prepared by a lead agency under NEPA.

(3) Supplementation of State documents

If the lead agency adopts or incorporates analysis and documentation described in paragraph (1), the lead agency shall prepare and publish a supplemental document if the lead agency determines that during the period after preparation of the analysis and documentation and before the adoption or incorporation

(A) a significant change has been made to the covered project that is relevant for purposes of environmental review of the project; or

(B) there has been a significant circumstance or new information has emerged that is relevant to the environmental review for the covered project.

(4) Comments

If a lead agency prepares and publishes a supplemental document under paragraph (3), the lead agency shall solicit comments from other agencies and the public on the supplemental document for a period of not more than 45 days, beginning on the date on which the supplemental document is published, unless

(A) the lead agency, the project sponsor, and any cooperating agency agree to a longer deadline; or

(B) the lead agency extends the deadline for good cause.

(5) Notice of outcome of environmental review

A lead agency shall issue a record of decision or finding of no significant impact, as appropriate, based on the document adopted under paragraph (1) and any supplemental document prepared under paragraph (3).
