(1) There is established in the Treasury a loan and loan guarantee fund (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “fund”) which shall be available to the Secretary without fiscal year limitation, in such amounts as may be specified from time to time in appropriations Acts

(A) to enable him to make loans under this part,

(E) for payment of interest on loans which are sold and guaranteed, and

(F) to enable the Secretary to take the action authorized by subsection (f). There are authorized to be appropriated from time to time such amounts as may be necessary to provide the sums required for the fund. There shall also be deposited in the fund amounts received by the Secretary in connection with loans and loan guarantees under this part and other property or assets derived by him from his operations respecting such loans and loan guarantees, including any money derived from the sale of assets.

(2) If at any time the sums in the funds are insufficient to enable the Secretary

(B) to otherwise comply with guarantees under this part of loans to nonprofit private entities,

(E) to make payments of interest on loans which are sold and guaranteed, and

Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any notes and other obligations issued under this paragraph and for that purpose he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which the securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this paragraph. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. Sums borrowed under this paragraph shall be deposited in the fund and redemption of such notes and obligations shall be made by the Secretary from the fund.
