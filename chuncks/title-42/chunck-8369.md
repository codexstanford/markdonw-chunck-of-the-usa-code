# Title 42— THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE
### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (w) Prohibition on use of voluntary contributions, and limitation on use of provider-specific taxes to obtain Federal financial participation under medicaid
######## (D) A tax imposed with respect to a class of health care items and services is considered to be imposed uniformly
######### (ii) The Secretary shall approve such an application if the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that

(I) the net impact of the tax and associated expenditures under this subchapter as proposed by the State is generally redistributive in nature, and

(II) the amount of the tax is not directly correlated to payments under this subchapter for items or services with respect to which the tax is imposed. The Secretary shall by regulation specify types of credits, exclusions, and deductions that will be considered to meet the requirements of this subparagraph.

(F) In no case shall a tax not qualify as a broad-based health care related tax under this paragraph because it does not apply to a hospital that is described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code and that does not accept payment under the State plan under this subchapter or under subchapter XVIII.

(4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(iii), there is in effect a hold harmless provision with respect to a broad-based health care related tax imposed with respect to a class of items or services if the Secretary determines that any of the following applies:

(A) The State or other unit of government imposing the tax provides (directly or indirectly) for a payment (other than under this subchapter) to taxpayers and the amount of such payment is positively correlated either to the amount of such tax or to the difference between the amount of the tax and the amount of payment under the State plan.

(B) All or any portion of the payment made under this subchapter to the taxpayer varies based only upon the amount of the total tax paid.

(C)

(i) The State or other unit of government imposing the tax provides (directly or indirectly) for any payment, offset, or waiver that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for any portion of the costs of the tax.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a determination of the existence of an indirect guarantee shall be made under paragraph (3)(i) of section 433.68(f) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on November 1, 2006 , except that for portions of fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2008 , and before October 1, 2011 , “5.5 percent” shall be substituted for “6 percent” each place it appears. The provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent use of the tax to reimburse health care providers in a class for expenditures under this subchapter nor preclude States from relying on such reimbursement to justify or explain the tax in the legislative process.

(5)

(A) For purposes of this subsection, the limit under this subparagraph with respect to a State is an amount equal to 25 percent (or, if greater, the State base percentage, as defined in subparagraph (B)) of the non-Federal share of the total amount expended under the State plan during a State fiscal year (or portion thereof), as it would be determined pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) without regard to paragraph (1)(A)(iv).

(B)
