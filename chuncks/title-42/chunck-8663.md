A health benefits coverage plan that is offered and generally available to State employees in the State involved.

The health insurance coverage plan that

(i) is offered by a health maintenance organization (as defined in section 300gg–91(b)(3) of this title ), and

(ii) has the largest insured commercial, non-medicaid enrollment of covered lives of such coverage plans offered by such a health maintenance organization in the State involved.

(D) Secretary-approved coverage

Any other health benefits coverage that the Secretary determines, upon application by a State, provides appropriate coverage for the population proposed to be provided such coverage.

(2) Benchmark-equivalent coverage

For purposes of subsection (a)(1), subject to paragraphs (5) and (6)  1 coverage that meets the following requirement shall be considered to be benchmark-equivalent coverage:

(v) Mental health services.

(vi) Well-baby and well-child care, including age-appropriate immunizations.

(vii) Other appropriate preventive services, as designated by the Secretary.

(B) Aggregate actuarial value equivalent to benchmark package

The coverage has an aggregate actuarial value that is at least actuarially equivalent to one of the benchmark benefit packages described in paragraph (1).

(C) Substantial actuarial value for additional services included in benchmark package

With respect to each of the following categories of additional services for which coverage is provided under the benchmark benefit package used under subparagraph (B), the coverage has an actuarial value that is equal to at least 75 percent of the actuarial value of the coverage of that category of services in such package:

(i) Vision services.

(ii) Hearing services.

(3) Determination of actuarial value

The actuarial value of coverage of benchmark benefit packages shall be set forth in an actuarial opinion in an actuarial report that has been prepared

(B) using generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies;

(C) using a standardized set of utilization and price factors;

(D) using a standardized population that is representative of the population involved;

(G) taking into account the ability of a State to reduce benefits by taking into account the increase in actuarial value of benefits coverage offered under this subchapter that results from the limitations on cost sharing under such coverage. The actuary preparing the opinion shall select and specify in the memorandum the standardized set and population to be used under subparagraphs (C) and (D).

(4) Coverage of rural health clinic and FQHC services

Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section, a State may not provide for medical assistance through enrollment of an individual with benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage under this section unless

(B) payment for such services is made in accordance with the requirements of section 1396a(bb) of this title .

(6) Mental health services parity

(A) In general

In the case of any benchmark benefit package under paragraph (1) or benchmark equivalent coverage under paragraph (2) that is offered by an entity that is not a medicaid managed care organization and that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the entity shall ensure that the financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits comply with the requirements of section 300gg–26(a) of this title in the same manner as such requirements apply to a group health plan. In applying the previous sentence with respect to requirements under paragraph (8) of section 300gg–26(a) of this title , a benchmark benefit package or benchmark equivalent coverage described in such sentence shall be treated as in compliance with such requirements if the State plan under this subchapter or the benchmark benefit package or benefit equivalent coverage, as applicable, is in compliance with subpart C of part 440 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.
