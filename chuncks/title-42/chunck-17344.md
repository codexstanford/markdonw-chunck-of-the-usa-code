### CHAPTER 93— EMERGENCY ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 8511. National and State emergency conservation targets
##### (a) Determination and publication of targets
######### (ii) The President may, to the extent he determines appropriate, further adjust any State base period consumption to reflect

(I) reduction in energy consumption already achieved by energy conservation programs;

(II) energy shortages which may affect energy consumption; and

(III) variations in weather from seasonal norms.

(D) For purposes of this subsection, the uniform national percentage shall be designed by the President to minimize the impact on the domestic economy of the projected shortage in the energy source for which a target is established by saving an amount of such energy source equivalent to the projected shortage, taking into consideration such other factors related to that shortage as the President considers appropriate.
