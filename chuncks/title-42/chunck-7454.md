#### § 1395w–4. Payment for physicians’ services
##### (b) Establishment of fee schedules

(1) In general

Before November 1 of the preceding year, for each year beginning with 1998, subject to subsection (p), the Secretary shall establish, by regulation, fee schedules that establish payment amounts for all physicians’ services furnished in all fee schedule areas (as defined in subsection (j)(2)) for the year. Except as provided in paragraph (2), each such payment amount for a service shall be equal to the product of

(A) the relative value for the service (as determined in subsection (c)(2)),

(B) the conversion factor (established under subsection (d)) for the year, and

(C) the geographic adjustment factor (established under subsection (e)(2)) for the service for the fee schedule area.

(2) Treatment of radiology services and anesthesia services

(A) Radiology services

With respect to radiology services (including radiologist services, as defined in section 1395m(b)(6) of this title ), the Secretary shall base the relative values on the relative value scale developed under section 1395m(b)(1)(A) of this title , with appropriate modifications of the relative values to assure that the relative values established for radiology services which are similar or related to other physicians’ services are consistent with the relative values established for those similar or related services.

(B) Anesthesia services

In establishing the fee schedule for anesthesia services for which a relative value guide has been established under section 4048(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the Secretary shall use, to the extent practicable, such relative value guide, with appropriate adjustment of the conversion factor, in a manner to assure that the fee schedule amounts for anesthesia services are consistent with the fee schedule amounts for other services determined by the Secretary to be of comparable value. In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall adjust the conversion factor by geographic adjustment factors in the same manner as such adjustment is made under paragraph (1)(C).

(C) Consultation

The Secretary shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and organizations representing physicians or suppliers who furnish radiology services and anesthesia services in applying subparagraphs (A) and (B).

(3) Treatment of interpretation of electrocardiograms

The Secretary

(A) shall make separate payment under this section for the interpretation of electrocardiograms performed or ordered to be performed as part of or in conjunction with a visit to or a consultation with a physician, and

(B) shall adjust the relative values established for visits and consultations under subsection (c) so as not to include relative value units for interpretations of electrocardiograms in the relative value for visits and consultations.

(4) Special rule for imaging services

(A) In general

In the case of imaging services described in subparagraph (B) furnished on or after January 1, 2007 , if

(i) the technical component (including the technical component portion of a global fee) of the service established for a year under the fee schedule described in paragraph (1) without application of the geographic adjustment factor described in paragraph (1)(C), exceeds

(ii) the Medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services under paragraph (3)(D) of section 1395 l (t) of this title for such service for such year, determined without regard to geographic adjustment under paragraph (2)(D) of such section, the Secretary shall substitute the amount described in clause (ii), adjusted by the geographic adjustment factor described in paragraph (1)(C), for the fee schedule amount for such technical component for such year.

(B) Imaging services described

For purposes of subparagraph (A), imaging services described in this subparagraph are imaging and computer-assisted imaging services, including X-ray, ultrasound (including echocardiography), nuclear medicine (including positron emission tomography), magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and fluoroscopy, but excluding diagnostic and screening mammography, and for 2010, 2011, and the first 2 months of 2012, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry services (as described in paragraph (6)).

(C) Adjustment in imaging utilization rate

With respect to fee schedules established for 2011, 2012, and 2013, in the methodology for determining practice expense relative value units for expensive diagnostic imaging equipment under the final rule published by the Secretary in the Federal Register on November 25, 2009 (42 CFR 410 et al.), the Secretary shall use a 75 percent assumption instead of the utilization rates otherwise established in such final rule. With respect to fee schedules established for 2014 and subsequent years, in such methodology, the Secretary shall use a 90 percent utilization rate.

(D) Adjustment in technical component discount on single-session imaging involving consecutive body parts

For services furnished on or after July 1, 2010 , the Secretary shall increase the reduction in payments attributable to the multiple procedure payment reduction applicable to the technical component for imaging under the final rule published by the Secretary in the Federal Register on November 21, 2005 (part 405 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations) from 25 percent to 50 percent.

(5) Treatment of intensive cardiac rehabilitation program

(A) In general

In the case of an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program described in section 1395x(eee)(4) of this title , the Secretary shall substitute the Medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department service under paragraph (3)(D) of section 1395 l (t) of this title for cardiac rehabilitation (under HCPCS codes 93797 and 93798 for calendar year 2007, or any succeeding HCPCS codes for cardiac rehabilitation).

(B) Definition of session

Each of the services described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 1395x(eee)(3) of this title , when furnished for one hour, is a separate session of intensive cardiac rehabilitation.

(C) Multiple sessions per day

Payment may be made for up to 6 sessions per day of the series of 72 one-hour sessions of intensive cardiac rehabilitation services described in section 1395x(eee)(4)(B) of this title .

(6) Treatment of bone mass scans

For dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry services (identified in 2006 by HCPCS codes 76075 and 76077 (and any succeeding codes)) furnished during 2010, 2011, and the first 2 months of 2012, instead of the payment amount that would otherwise be determined under this section for such years, the payment amount shall be equal to 70 percent of the product of

(A) the relative value for the service (as determined in subsection (c)(2)) for 2006;

(B) the conversion factor (established under subsection (d)) for 2006; and

(C) the geographic adjustment factor (established under subsection (e)(2)) for the service for the fee schedule area for 2010, 2011, and the first 2 months of 2012, respectively.

(7) Adjustment in discount for certain multiple therapy services

In the case of therapy services furnished on or after January 1, 2011 , and before April 1, 2013 , and for which payment is made under fee schedules established under this section, instead of the 25 percent multiple procedure payment reduction specified in the final rule published by the Secretary in the Federal Register on November 29, 2010 , the reduction percentage shall be 20 percent. In the case of such services furnished on or after April 1, 2013 , and for which payment is made under such fee schedules, instead of the 25 percent multiple procedure payment reduction specified in such final rule, the reduction percentage shall be 50 percent.

(8) Encouraging care management for individuals with chronic care needs
