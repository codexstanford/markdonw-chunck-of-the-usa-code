#### § 19014. Expanding geographic and institutional diversity in research
##### (b) Fostering STEM research diversity and capacity program

(1) In general

The Director shall make awards on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis to eligible institutions to implement and study innovative approaches for building research capacity in order to engage and retain students from a range of institutions and diverse backgrounds in STEM.

(2) Eligible institution defined

In this subsection the term “eligible institution” means an institution of higher education that, according to the data published by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, is not, on average, among the top 100 institutions in Federal research and development expenditures during the 3-year period prior to the year of the award.

(3) Purpose

The activities under this subsection shall be focused on achieving simultaneous impacts at the student, faculty, and institutional levels by increasing the research capacity at eligible institutions and the number of undergraduate and graduate students pursuing STEM degrees from eligible institutions.

(4) Requirements

In carrying out this program, the Director shall

(A) require eligible institutions seeking funding under this subsection to submit an application to the Director at such time, in such manner, containing such information and assurances as the Director may require. The application shall include, at a minimum a description of how the eligible institution plans to sustain the proposed activities beyond the duration of the award;

(B) require applicants to identify disciplines and focus areas in which the eligible institution can excel, and explain how the applicant will use the award to build capacity to bolster the institutional research competitiveness of eligible entities to support awards made by the Foundation and increase regional and national capacity in STEM;

(C) require the awards funded under this subsection to support research and related activities, which may include

(i) development or expansion of research programs in disciplines and focus areas in subparagraph (B);

(ii) faculty recruitment and professional development in disciplines and focus areas in subparagraph (B), including for early-career researchers;

(iii) stipends for undergraduate and graduate students participating in research in disciplines and focus areas in subparagraph (B);

(iv) acquisition of instrumentation necessary to build research capacity at an eligible institution in disciplines and focus areas in subparagraph (B);

(v) an assessment of capacity-building and research infrastructure needs;

(vi) administrative research development support; and

(vii) other activities necessary to build research capacity; and

(D) require that no eligible institution should receive more than $10,000,000 in any single year of funds made available under this section.

(5) Additional considerations

In making awards under this subsection, the Director may also consider

(A) the extent to which the applicant will support students from diverse backgrounds, including first-generation undergraduate students;

(B) the geographic and institutional diversity of the applying institutions; and

(C) how the applicants can leverage public-private partnerships and existing partnerships with Federal Research Agencies.

(6) Duplication

The Director shall ensure the awards made under this subsection are complementary and not duplicative of existing programs.

(7) Report

The Director shall submit a report to Congress after the third year of the program that includes

(A) an assessment of the effectiveness of the program for growing the geographic and institutional diversity of institutions of higher education receiving research awards from the Foundation;

(B) an assessment of the quality, quantity, and geographic and institutional diversity of institutions of higher education conducting Foundation-sponsored research since the establishment of the program in this subsection;

(C) an assessment of the quantity and diversity of undergraduate and graduate students graduating from eligible institutions with STEM degrees; and

(D) statistical summary data on the program, including the geographic and institutional allocation of award funding, the number and diversity of supported graduate and undergraduate students, and how it contributes to capacity building at eligible entities.

(8) Authorization of appropriations

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director $150,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 to carry out the activities under this subsection.
