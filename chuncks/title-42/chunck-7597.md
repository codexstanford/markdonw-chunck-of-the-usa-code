### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–111. PDP regions; submission of bids; plan approval
##### (f) Application of limited risk plans

(1) Conditions for approval of limited risk plans

The Secretary may only approve a limited risk plan (as defined in paragraph (4)(A)) for a PDP region if the access requirements under section 1395w–103(a) of this title would not be met for the region but for the approval of such a plan (or a fallback prescription drug plan under subsection (g)).

(2) Rules

The following rules shall apply with respect to the approval of a limited risk plan in a PDP region:

(A) Limited exercise of authority

Only the minimum number of such plans may be approved in order to meet the access requirements under section 1395w–103(a) of this title .

(B) Maximizing assumption of risk

The Secretary shall provide priority in approval for those plans bearing the highest level of risk (as computed by the Secretary), but the Secretary may take into account the level of the bids submitted by such plans.

(C) No full underwriting for limited risk plans

In no case may the Secretary approve a limited risk plan under which the modification of risk level provides for no (or a de minimis) level of financial risk.

(3) Acceptance of all full risk contracts

There shall be no limit on the number of full risk plans that are approved under subsection (e).

(4) Risk-plans defined

For purposes of this subsection:

(A) Limited risk plan

The term “limited risk plan” means a prescription drug plan that provides basic prescription drug coverage and for which the PDP sponsor includes a modification of risk level described in subparagraph (E) of subsection (b)(2) in its bid submitted for the plan under such subsection. Such term does not include a fallback prescription drug plan.

(B) Full risk plan

The term “full risk plan” means a prescription drug plan that is not a limited risk plan or a fallback prescription drug plan.
