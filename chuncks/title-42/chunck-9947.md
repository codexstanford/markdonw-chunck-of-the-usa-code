(II) not more than 1 percent of the amount of funds allocated to a State agency under this section for nutrition services and administration for a fiscal year may be expended by the State agency for allowable expenses incurred under this section for supplemental foods and nutrition services and administration during the preceding fiscal year; and

(ii)

(I) for each fiscal year, of the amounts allocated to a State agency for nutrition services and administration, an amount equal to not more than 3 percent of the amount allocated to the State agency under this section for the fiscal year may be expended by the State agency for allowable expenses incurred under this section for nutrition services and administration during the subsequent fiscal year; and

(B) Any funds made available to a State agency in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) for a fiscal year shall not affect the amount of funds allocated to the State agency for such year.

(C) The Secretary may authorize a State agency to expend not more than 3 percent of the amount of funds allocated to a State under this section for supplemental foods for a fiscal year for expenses incurred under this section for supplemental foods during the preceding fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that there has been a significant reduction in infant formula cost containment savings provided to the State agency that would affect the ability of the State agency to at least maintain the level of participation by eligible participants served by the State agency.

(4) For purposes of the formula, if Indians are served by the health department of a State, the formula shall be based on the State population inclusive of the Indians within the State boundaries.

(5) If Indians residing in the State are served by a State agency other than the health department of the State, the population of the tribes within the jurisdiction of the State being so served shall not be included in the formula for such State, and shall instead be included in the formula for the State agency serving the Indians.

(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may use a portion of a State agency’s allocation to purchase supplemental foods for donation to the State agency under this section.

(7) In addition to any amounts expended under paragraph (3)(A)(i), any State agency using cost containment measures as defined in subsection (h)(9) may temporarily use amounts made available to such agency for the first quarter of a fiscal year to defray expenses for costs incurred during the final quarter of the preceding fiscal year. In any fiscal year, any State agency that uses amounts made available for a succeeding fiscal year under the authority of the preceding sentence shall restore or reimburse such amounts when such agency receives payment as a result of its cost containment measures for such expenses.

(8) Temporary spending authority .

During each of fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the Secretary may authorize a State agency to expend more than the amount otherwise authorized under paragraph (3)(C) for expenses incurred under this section for supplemental foods during the preceding fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that

(A) there has been a significant reduction in reported infant formula cost containment savings for the preceding fiscal year due to the implementation of subsection (h)(8)(K); and

(B) the reduction would affect the ability of the State agency to serve all eligible participants.
