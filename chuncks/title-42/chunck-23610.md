#### § 18951. International standards development
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the principles of openness, transparency, due process, balance of interests, appeals, and consensus in the development of international standards are critical;

(2) voluntary consensus standards, developed through an industry-led process, serve as the cornerstone of the United States standardization system and have become the basis of a sound national economy and the key to global market access;

(3) strengthening the unique United States public-private partnerships approach to standards development is critical to United States economic competitiveness; and

(4) the United States Government should ensure cooperation and coordination across Federal agencies to partner with and support private sector stakeholders to continue to shape international dialogues in regard to standards development for emerging technologies.
