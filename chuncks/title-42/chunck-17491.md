#### § 8817. General requirements regarding financial assistance
##### (a) Priorities, terms, availability, etc.

(1) Priority for financial assistance under this subchapter, and the most favorable financial terms available, shall be provided to a person for any biomass energy project that

(A) uses a primary fuel other than petroleum or natural gas in the production of biomass fuel, such as geothermal energy resources, solar energy resources, or waste heat; or

(B) applies new technologies which expand the possible feedstocks, produces new forms of biomass energy, or produces biomass fuel using improved or new technologies. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to exclude financial assistance for any project which does not use such a fuel or apply such a technology.

(2)

(A) Financial assistance under this subchapter shall be available for a biomass energy project only if the Secretary concerned finds that the Btu content of the motor fuels to be used in the facility involved to produce the biomass fuel will not exceed the Btu content of the biomass fuel produced in the facility.

(B) In making the determination under subparagraph (A), the Secretary concerned shall take into account any displacement of motor fuel or other petroleum products which the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary would result from the use of the biomass fuel produced in the facility involved.

(3) No financial assistance may be provided under this subchapter to any person for any biomass energy project if the Secretary concerned finds that the process to be used by the project will not extract the protein content of the feedstock for utilization as food or feed for readily available markets in any case in which to do so would be technically and economically practicable.

(4) Financial assistance may not be provided under this subchapter to any person unless the Secretary concerned

(A) finds that necessary feedstocks are available and it is reasonable to expect they will continue to be available in the future, and, for biomass energy projects using wood or wood wastes or residues from the National Forest System, there shall be taken into account current levels of use by then existing facilities;

(B) has obtained assurance that the person receiving such financial assistance will bear a reasonable degree of risk in the construction and operation of the project; and

(C) has determined that the amount of financial assistance provided for the project is not greater than is necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter.

(5) In providing financial assistance under this subchapter, the Secretary concerned shall give due consideration to promoting competition.

(6) In determining the amount of financial assistance for any biomass energy project which will yield byproducts in addition to biomass energy, the Secretary shall consider the potential value of such byproducts and the costs attributable to their production.
