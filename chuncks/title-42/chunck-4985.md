##### (b) Application of acceptable alternative mechanisms

(1) Presumption

(A) In general

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, a State is presumed to be implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism in accordance with this section as of July 1, 1997 , if, by not later than April 1, 1997 , the chief executive officer of a State

(i) notifies the Secretary that the State has enacted or intends to enact (by not later than January 1, 1998 , or July 1, 1998 , in the case of a State described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) any necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism as of January 1, 1998 , 1 (or, in the case of a State described in subparagraph (B)(ii), July 1, 1998 ); and

(ii) provides the Secretary with such information as the Secretary may require to review the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation) under this subsection.

(B) Delay permitted for certain States

(i) Effect of delay

In the case of a State described in clause (ii) that provides notice under subparagraph (A)(i), for the presumption to continue on and after July 1, 1998 , the chief executive officer of the State by April 1, 1998

(I) must notify the Secretary that the State has enacted any necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism as of July 1, 1998 ; and

(II) must provide the Secretary with such information as the Secretary may require to review the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation) under this subsection.

(ii) States described

A State described in this clause is a State that has a legislature that does not meet within the 12-month period beginning on August 21, 1996 .

(C) Continued application

In order for a mechanism to continue to be presumed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism, the State shall provide the Secretary every 3 years with information described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (B)(i)(II) (as the case may be).

(2) Notice

If the Secretary finds, after review of information provided under paragraph (1) and in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State and the insurance commissioner or chief insurance regulatory official of the State, that such a mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not (or no longer) being implemented, the Secretary

(A) shall notify the State of

(i) such preliminary determination, and

(ii) the consequences under paragraph (3) of a failure to implement such a mechanism; and

(B) shall permit the State a reasonable opportunity in which to modify the mechanism (or to adopt another mechanism) in a manner so that may be an acceptable alternative mechanism or to provide for implementation of such a mechanism.

(3) Final determination

If, after providing notice and opportunity under paragraph (2), the Secretary finds that the mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or the State is not implementing such a mechanism, the Secretary shall notify the State that the State is no longer considered to be implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism and that the requirements of section 300gg–41 of this title shall apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in the State, effective as of a date specified in the notice.

(4) Limitation on secretarial authority

The Secretary shall not make a determination under paragraph (2) or (3) on any basis other than the basis that a mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not being implemented.

(5) Future adoption of mechanisms

If a State, after January 1, 1997 , submits the notice and information described in paragraph (1), unless the Secretary makes a finding described in paragraph (3) within the 90-day period beginning on the date of submission of the notice and information, the mechanism shall be considered to be an acceptable alternative mechanism for purposes of this section, effective 90 days after the end of such period, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (1).
