#### § 1395s. Payment of premiums
##### (i) Adjustments for individuals enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans

In the case of an individual enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan, the Secretary shall provide for necessary adjustments of the monthly beneficiary premium to reflect 80 percent of any reduction elected under section 1395w–24(f)(1)(E) of this title and to reflect any credit provided under section 1395w–24(b)(1)(C)(iv)  1 of this title.
