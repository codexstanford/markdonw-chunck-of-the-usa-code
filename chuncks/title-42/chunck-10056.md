#### § 1862i. STEM education
##### (c) Articulation partnerships

(1) Partnership grants

(A) The Director shall make grants to eligible partnerships to encourage the development of career and educational pathways with multiple entry and exit points leading to credentials and degrees, and to assist students pursuing pathways in STEM fields to transition from associate-degree-granting colleges to bachelor-  1 degree-granting institutions, through such means as

(i) examining curricula to develop articulation agreements that ensure that academic credit earned at the associate-degree-granting college is transferable to bachelor-degree-granting institutions;

(ii) informing teachers from the associate-degree-granting college on the specific requirements of the career and educational pathways supported by the articulation agreements; and

(iii) providing summer educational programs for students from the associate-degree-granting college to encourage such students’ subsequent matriculation at bachelor-degree-granting institutions.

(B) Each eligible partnership receiving a grant under this paragraph shall, at a minimum

(i) counsel students, including students who have been in the workforce (including veterans and individuals engaged in work in the home), about the requirements and course offerings of the bachelor-degree-granting institution;

(ii) conduct workshops and orientation sessions to ensure that students are familiar with programs, including laboratories and financial aid programs, at the bachelor-degree-granting institution;

(iii) provide students with research experiences at institutions or work sites participating in the partnership, including stipend support for students participating in summer programs or industry internships; and

(iv) provide faculty mentors for students participating in activities under clause (iii), including summer salary support for faculty mentors.

(2) Outreach grants

The Director shall make grants to associate-degree-granting colleges with outstanding STEM programs to strengthen relationships with secondary schools and, as appropriate, elementary schools, in the community served by the college by improving STEM education and encouraging the interest and aptitude of students at these schools for careers in STEM and advanced-technology fields through such means as developing articulation agreements or dual credit courses with local secondary schools, or other means as the Director determines appropriate, to enable students to satisfy entrance and course requirements at the associate-degree-granting college.

(3) Mentor training grants

The Director shall establish a program to encourage and make grants available to institutions of higher education that award associate degrees to recruit and train individuals from STEM fields to mentor students who are described in section 1885a or 1885b of this title in order to assist those students in identifying, qualifying for, and entering higher-paying technical jobs in those fields, including jobs at Federal and academic laboratories.
