(C) any debt obligation can be serviced from project income, including operating assistance; and

(3) Opportunity to cure

Any lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under this part shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.
