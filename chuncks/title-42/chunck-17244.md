#### § 8352. Permanent exemptions
##### (g) Permanent exemption for intermediate load powerplants

(1) After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption from one or more of the prohibitions of part A on the use of petroleum by a powerplant, the Secretary may, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that

(A) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (or the appropriate State air pollution control agency) certifies to the Secretary that the use by such powerplant of coal or any available alternate fuel as a primary energy source will cause or contribute to a concentration, in an air quality control region or any area within such region, of a pollutant for which any national ambient air quality standard is or would be exceeded for such area;

(B) such powerplant is to be operated only to replace no more than the equivalent capacity of existing electric powerplants

(i) which use natural gas or petroleum as a primary energy source,

(ii) which are owned by the same person who is to operate such powerplant, and

(iii) which, if they used coal as a primary energy source, would cause or contribute to such a concentration in such region;

(C) such powerplant is and shall continue to be operated solely as an intermediate load powerplant;

(D) the net fuel heat input rate for such powerplant will be maintained at or less than 9,500 Btu’s per kilowatt hour throughout the remaining useful life of the powerplant; and

(E) the powerplant has the capability to use synthetic fuels derived from coal or other alternate fuel.

(2) The Secretary shall, from time to time, review each exemption granted to a powerplant under this subsection, and shall terminate such exemption if he finds that there is available a supply of synthetic fuel derived from coal or other alternate fuel suitable for use as a primary energy source by such powerplant.
