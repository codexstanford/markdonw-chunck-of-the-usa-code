#### § 1395ss. Certification of medicare supplemental health insurance policies
##### (d) Criminal penalties; civil penalties for certain violations
######### (i) It is unlawful for a person to sell or issue to an individual entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B of this subchapter (including an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan under section 1395w–21 of this title )

(I) a health insurance policy with knowledge that the policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled under this subchapter or subchapter XIX,

(II) in the case of an individual not electing a Medicare+Choice plan, a medicare supplemental policy with knowledge that the individual is entitled to benefits under another medicare supplemental policy or in the case of an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan, a medicare supplemental policy with knowledge that the policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled under the Medicare+Choice plan or under another medicare supplemental policy, or

(III) a health insurance policy (other than a medicare supplemental policy) with knowledge that the policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled, other than benefits to which the individual is entitled under a requirement of State or Federal law.

(ii) Whoever violates clause (i) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a person other than the issuer of the policy) for each such prohibited act.

(iii) A seller (who is not the issuer of a health insurance policy) shall not be considered to violate clause (i)(II) with respect to the sale of a medicare supplemental policy if the policy is sold in compliance with subparagraph (B).

(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance policy (other than a Medicare supplemental policy) providing for benefits which are payable to or on behalf of an individual without regard to other health benefit coverage of such individual is not considered to “duplicate” any health benefits under this subchapter, under subchapter XIX, or under a health insurance policy, and subclauses (I) and (III) of clause (i) do not apply to such a policy.
