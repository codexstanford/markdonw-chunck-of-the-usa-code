The standards and procedures prescribed under subsection (b) shall include the following requirements:

(1)

(A)

(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, meetings held to develop or carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action under this subsection shall permit attendance by representatives of committees of Congress and interested persons, including all interested segments of the petroleum industry, consumers, and the public; shall be preceded by timely and adequate notice with identification of the agenda of such meeting to the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, committees of Congress, and (except during an international energy supply emergency with respect to meetings to carry out a voluntary agreement or to develop or carry out a plan of action) the public; and shall be initiated and chaired by a regular full-time Federal employee.

(ii) Meetings of bodies created by the International Energy Agency established by the international energy program need not be open to interested persons and need not be initiated and chaired by a regular full-time Federal employee.

(iii) The President, in consultation with the Secretary, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, may determine that a meeting held to carry out a voluntary agreement or to develop or carry out a plan of action shall not be open to interested persons or that attendance by interested persons may be limited, if the President finds that a wider disclosure would be detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States.

(B) No meetings may be held to develop or carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action under this section unless a regular full-time Federal employee is present.

(2) Interested persons permitted to attend such a meeting shall be afforded an opportunity to present, in writing and orally, data, views, and arguments at such meetings, subject to any reasonable limitations with respect to the manner of presentation of data, views, and arguments as the Secretary may impose.

(3) A full and complete record, and where practicable a verbatim transcript, shall be kept of any meeting held, and a full and complete record shall be kept of any communication (other than in a meeting) made, between or among participants or potential participants, to develop, or carry out a voluntary agreement or a plan of action under this section. Such record or transcript shall be deposited, together with any agreement resulting therefrom, with the Secretary, and shall be available to the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission. Such records or transcripts shall be available for public inspection and copying in accordance with section 552 of title 5 ; except that (A) matter may not be withheld from disclosure under section 552(b) of such title on grounds other than the grounds specified in section 552(b)(1), (b)(3), or so much of (b)(4) as relates to trade secrets; and (B) in the exercise of authority under section 552(b)(1), the President shall consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary, and the Attorney General with respect to questions relating to the foreign policy interests of the United States.

(4) No provision of this section may be exercised so as to prevent representatives of committees of Congress from attending meetings to which this section applies, or from having access to any transcripts, records, and agreements kept or made under this section. Such access to any transcript that is required to be kept for any meeting shall be provided as soon as practicable (but not later than 14 days) after that meeting.
