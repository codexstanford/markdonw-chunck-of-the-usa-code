##### (c) Applicability

(1) Unless applicable pursuant to paragraph (2), the requirements of subsection (a) shall apply in any State and shall be administered and enforced as provided in subsection (g) only if

(A) the Governor of that State submits a request to the Secretary to have such requirements applicable in that State; and

(B) the attorney general of that State has found that (i) absent a delegation of authority under a Federal law, the Governor lacks the authority under the laws of the State to invoke comparable requirements, (ii) under applicable State law, the Governor and other appropriate State officers and employees are not prevented from administering and enforcing such requirements under a delegation of authority pursuant to Federal law, and (iii) if implemented such requirements would not be contrary to State law. Subject to paragraph (2), such provisions shall cease to apply in any State if the Governor of the State withdraws any request under subparagraph (A).

(2) The requirements of subsection (a) shall apply in every State if there is in effect a finding by the President that nationwide implementation of such requirements would be appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

(3) Such requirements shall take effect in any State beginning on the 5th day after the Secretary or the President (as the case may be) publishes notice in the Federal Register of the applicability of the requirements to the State pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2).

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority vested in the President under paragraph (2) may not be delegated.
