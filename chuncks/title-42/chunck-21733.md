(2) Purpose

The purpose of the smart energy and water efficiency pilot program is to award grants to eligible entities to demonstrate unique, advanced, or innovative technology-based solutions that will

(A) improve the net energy balance of water, wastewater, and water reuse systems;

(B) improve the net energy balance of water, wastewater, and water reuse systems to help communities across the United States make measurable progress in conserving water, saving energy, and reducing costs;

(C) support the implementation of innovative and unique processes and the installation of established advanced automated systems that provide real-time data on energy and water; and

(D) improve energy-water conservation and quality and predictive maintenance through technologies that utilize internet connected technologies, including sensors, intelligent gateways, and security embedded in hardware.

(3) Project selection

(A) In general

The Secretary shall make competitive, merit-reviewed grants under the pilot program to not less than 3, but not more than 5, eligible entities.
