#### § 1395l. Payment of benefits
##### (o) Limitation on benefit for payment for therapeutic shoes for individuals with severe diabetic foot disease

(1) In the case of shoes described in section 1395x(s)(12) of this title

(A) no payment may be made under this part, with respect to any individual for any year, for the furnishing of

(i) more than one pair of custom molded shoes (including inserts provided with such shoes) and 2 additional pairs of inserts for such shoes, or

(ii) more than one pair of extra-depth shoes (not including inserts provided with such shoes) and 3 pairs of inserts for such shoes, and

(B) with respect to expenses incurred in any calendar year, no more than the amount of payment applicable under paragraph (2) shall be considered as incurred expenses for purposes of subsections (a) and (b). Payment for shoes (or inserts) under this part shall be considered to include payment for any expenses for the fitting of such shoes (or inserts).

(2)

(A) Except as provided by the Secretary under subparagraphs (B) and (C), the amount of payment under this paragraph for custom molded shoes, extra-depth shoes, and inserts shall be the amount determined for such items by the Secretary under section 1395m(h) of this title .

(B) The Secretary may establish payment amounts for shoes and inserts that are lower than the amount established under section 1395m(h) of this title if the Secretary finds that shoes and inserts of an appropriate quality are readily available at or below the amount established under such section.

(C) In accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, an individual entitled to benefits with respect to shoes described in section 1395x(s)(12) of this title may substitute modification of such shoes instead of obtaining one (or more, as specified by the Secretary) pair of inserts (other than the original pair of inserts with respect to such shoes). In such case, the Secretary shall substitute, for the payment amount established under section 1395m(h) of this title , a payment amount that the Secretary estimates will assure that there is no net increase in expenditures under this subsection as a result of this subparagraph.

(3) In this subchapter, the term “shoes” includes, except for purposes of subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B) of paragraph (2), inserts for extra-depth shoes.
