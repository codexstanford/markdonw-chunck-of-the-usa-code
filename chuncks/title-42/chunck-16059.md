### CHAPTER 85— AIR POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 7403. Research, investigation, training, and other activities
##### (g) Pollution prevention and emissions control

(1) In general

In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall conduct a basic engineering research and technology program to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate nonregulatory strategies and technologies for air pollution prevention.

(2) Participation requirement

Such strategies and technologies described in paragraph (1) shall be developed with priority on those pollutants which pose a significant risk to human health and the environment, and with opportunities for participation by industry, public interest groups, scientists, States, institutions of higher education, and other interested persons in the development of such strategies and technologies.

(3) Program inclusions

The program under this subsection shall include the following elements:

(A) Improvements in nonregulatory strategies and technologies for preventing or reducing multiple air pollutants, including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals, PM–10 (particulate matter), carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, from stationary sources, including fossil fuel power plants. Such strategies and technologies shall include improvements in the relative cost effectiveness and long-range implications of various air pollutant reduction and nonregulatory control strategies such as energy conservation, including end-use efficiency, and fuel-switching to cleaner fuels.

(III) Public participation

In carrying out subclause (II)(aa), the Administrator shall

(aa) provide notice of and, for a period of not less than 60 days, an opportunity for public comment on, any draft or proposed version of the requirements described in subclause (II)(aa); and

(bb) take into account public comments received in developing the final version of those requirements.

(iii) Direct Air Capture Technology Advisory Board

(I) Establishment

The Administrator may establish an advisory board to be known as the “Direct Air Capture Technology Advisory Board”.
