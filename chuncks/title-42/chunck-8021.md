##### (n) Transition compliance with revision of NAIC Model Regulation and Federal model standards
######## (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of an individual who had in effect, as of December 31, 1988 , a medicare supplemental policy with an insurer (as a policyholder or, in the case of a group policy, as a certificate holder) and the individual terminated coverage under such policy before December 13, 1989 , no medicare supplemental policy of the insurer shall be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) unless the insurer

(i) provides written notice, no earlier than December 15, 1989 , and no later than January 30, 1990 , to the policyholder or certificate holder (at the most recent available address) of the offer described in clause (ii), and

(ii) offers the individual, during a period of at least 60 days beginning not later than February 1, 1990 , reinstitution of coverage (with coverage effective as of January 1, 1990 ), under the terms which (I) do not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of pre-existing conditions, (II) provides for coverage which is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of such termination, and (III) provides for classification of premiums on which terms are at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification terms that would have applied to the policyholder or certificate holder had the coverage never terminated.

(B) An insurer is not required to make the offer under subparagraph (A)(ii) in the case of an individual who is a policyholder or certificate holder in another medicare supplemental policy as of December 13, 1989 , if (as of January 1, 1990 ) the individual is not subject to a waiting period with respect to treatment of a pre-existing condition under such other policy.
