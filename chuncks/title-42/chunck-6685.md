#### § 1320b–9a. Child health quality measures
##### (a) Development of an initial core set of health care quality measures for children enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP

(1) In general

Not later than January 1, 2010 , the Secretary shall identify and publish for general comment an initial, recommended core set of child health quality measures for use by State programs administered under subchapters XIX and XXI, health insurance issuers and managed care entities that enter into contracts with such programs, and providers of items and services under such programs.

(2) Identification of initial core measures

In consultation with the individuals and entities described in subsection (b)(3), the Secretary shall identify existing quality of care measures for children that are in use under public and privately sponsored health care coverage arrangements, or that are part of reporting systems that measure both the presence and duration of health insurance coverage over time.

(3) Recommendations and dissemination

Based on such existing and identified measures, the Secretary shall publish an initial core set of child health quality measures that includes (but is not limited to) the following:

(A) The duration of children’s health insurance coverage over a 12-month time period.

(B) The availability and effectiveness of a full range of

(i) preventive services, treatments, and services for acute conditions, including services to promote healthy birth, prevent and treat premature birth, and detect the presence or risk of physical or mental conditions that could adversely affect growth and development; and

(ii) treatments to correct or ameliorate the effects of physical and mental conditions, including chronic conditions and, with respect to dental care, conditions requiring the restoration of teeth, relief of pain and infection, and maintenance of dental health, in infants, young children, school-age children, and adolescents.

(C) The availability of care in a range of ambulatory and inpatient health care settings in which such care is furnished.

(D) The types of measures that, taken together, can be used to estimate the overall national quality of health care for children, including children with special needs, and to perform comparative analyses of pediatric health care quality and racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in child health and health care for children.

(4) Encourage voluntary and standardized reporting and mandatory reporting

(A) Voluntary reporting

Not later than 2 years after February 4, 2009 , the Secretary, in consultation with States, shall develop a standardized format for reporting information and procedures and approaches that encourage States to use the initial core measurement set to voluntarily report information regarding the quality of pediatric health care under subchapters XIX and XXI.

(B) Mandatory reporting

Beginning with the annual State report on fiscal year 2024 required under subsection (c)(1), the Secretary shall require States to use the initial core measurement set and any updates or changes to that set to report information regarding the quality of pediatric health care under subchapters XIX and XXI using the standardized format for reporting information and procedures developed under subparagraph (A).

(5) Adoption of best practices in implementing quality programs

The Secretary shall disseminate information to States regarding best practices among States with respect to measuring and reporting on the quality of health care for children, and shall facilitate the adoption of such best practices. In developing best practices approaches, the Secretary shall give particular attention to State measurement techniques that ensure the timeliness and accuracy of provider reporting, encourage provider reporting compliance, encourage successful quality improvement strategies, and improve efficiency in data collection using health information technology.

(6) Reports to Congress

Not later than January 1, 2011 , and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary shall report to Congress on

(A) the status of the Secretary’s efforts to improve

(i) quality related to the duration and stability of health insurance coverage for children under subchapters XIX and XXI;

(ii) the quality of children’s health care under such subchapters, including preventive health services, dental care, health care for acute conditions, chronic health care, and health services to ameliorate the effects of physical and mental conditions and to aid in growth and development of infants, young children, school-age children, and adolescents with special health care needs; and

(iii) the quality of children’s health care under such subchapters across the domains of quality, including clinical quality, health care safety, family experience with health care, health care in the most integrated setting, and elimination of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in health and health care;

(B) the status of voluntary reporting by States under subchapters XIX and XXI, utilizing the initial core quality measurement set and, beginning with the report required on January 1, 2025 , and for each annual report thereafter, the status of mandatory reporting by States under subchapters XIX and XXI, utilizing the initial core quality measurement set and any updates or changes to that set; and

(C) any recommendations for legislative changes needed to improve the quality of care provided to children under subchapters XIX and XXI, including recommendations for quality reporting by States.

(7) Technical assistance

The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to States to assist them in adopting and utilizing core child health quality measures in administering the State plans under subchapters XIX and XXI.

(8) Definition of core set

In this section, the term “core set” means a group of valid, reliable, and evidence-based quality measures that, taken together

(A) provide information regarding the quality of health coverage and health care for children;

(B) address the needs of children throughout the developmental age span; and

(C) allow purchasers, families, and health care providers to understand the quality of care in relation to the preventive needs of children, treatments aimed at managing and resolving acute conditions, and diagnostic and treatment services whose purpose is to correct or ameliorate physical, mental, or developmental conditions that could, if untreated or poorly treated, become chronic.
