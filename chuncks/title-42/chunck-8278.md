#### § 1396a. State plans for medical assistance
##### (n) Payment amounts

(1) In the case of medical assistance furnished under this subchapter for medicare cost-sharing respecting the furnishing of a service or item to a qualified medicare beneficiary, the State plan may provide payment in an amount with respect to the service or item that results in the sum of such payment amount and any amount of payment made under subchapter XVIII with respect to the service or item exceeding the amount that is otherwise payable under the State plan for the item or service for eligible individuals who are not qualified medicare beneficiaries.

(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), a State is not required to provide any payment for any expenses incurred relating to payment for deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments for medicare cost-sharing to the extent that payment under subchapter XVIII for the service would exceed the payment amount that otherwise would be made under the State plan under this subchapter for such service if provided to an eligible recipient other than a medicare beneficiary.

(3) In the case in which a State’s payment for medicare cost-sharing for a qualified medicare beneficiary with respect to an item or service is reduced or eliminated through the application of paragraph (2)

(A) for purposes of applying any limitation under subchapter XVIII on the amount that the beneficiary may be billed or charged for the service, the amount of payment made under subchapter XVIII plus the amount of payment (if any) under the State plan shall be considered to be payment in full for the service;

(B) the beneficiary shall not have any legal liability to make payment to a provider or to an organization described in section 1396b(m)(1)(A) of this title for the service; and

(C) any lawful sanction that may be imposed upon a provider or such an organization for excess charges under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII shall apply to the imposition of any charge imposed upon the individual in such case. This paragraph shall not be construed as preventing payment of any medicare cost-sharing by a medicare supplemental policy or an employer retiree health plan on behalf of an individual.
