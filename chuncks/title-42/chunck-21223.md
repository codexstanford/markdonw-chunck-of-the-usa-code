### CHAPTER 148— WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION
#### § 15703. National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program
##### (b) Responsibilities of Program agencies

(1) Lead agency

The National Institute of Standards and Technology shall have the primary responsibility for planning and coordinating the Program. In carrying out this paragraph, the Director shall

(A) ensure that the Program includes the necessary components to promote the implementation of windstorm risk reduction measures by Federal, State, and local governments, national standards and model building code organizations, architects and engineers, and others with a role in planning and constructing buildings and lifelines;

(B) support the development of performance-based engineering tools, and work with appropriate groups to promote the commercial application of such tools, including through wind-related model building codes, voluntary standards, and construction best practices;

(C) request the assistance of Federal agencies other than the Program agencies, as necessary to assist in carrying out this chapter;

(D) coordinate all Federal post-windstorm investigations to the extent practicable; and

(E) when warranted by research or investigative findings, issue recommendations to assist in informing the development of model codes, and provide information to Congress on the use of such recommendations.

(2) National Institute of Standards and Technology

In addition to the lead agency responsibilities described under paragraph (1), the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall be responsible for carrying out research and development to improve model building codes, voluntary standards, and best practices for the design, construction, and retrofit of buildings, structures, and lifelines.

(3) National Science Foundation

The National Science Foundation shall support research in

(A) engineering and the atmospheric sciences to improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on buildings, structures, and lifelines; and

(B) economic and social factors influencing windstorm risk reduction measures.

(4) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall support atmospheric sciences research to improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on buildings, structures, and lifelines.

(5) Federal Emergency Management Agency

The Federal Emergency Management Agency shall

(A) support

(i) the development of risk assessment tools and effective mitigation techniques;

(ii) windstorm-related data collection and analysis;

(iii) public outreach and information dissemination; and

(iv) promotion of the adoption of windstorm preparedness and mitigation measures, including for households, businesses, and communities, consistent with the Agency’s all-hazards approach; and

(B) work closely with national standards and model building code organizations, in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to promote the implementation of research results and promote better building practices within the building design and construction industry, including architects, engineers, contractors, builders, and inspectors.
