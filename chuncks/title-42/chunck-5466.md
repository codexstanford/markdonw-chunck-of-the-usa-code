If there is no person who would be entitled, upon application therefor, to an annuity under section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [ 45 U.S.C. 231a ], or to a lump-sum payment under section 6(b) of such Act [ 45 U.S.C. 231e(b) ], with respect to the death of an employee (as defined in such Act), then, notwithstanding section 410(a)(9) of this title , compensation (as defined in such Railroad Retirement Act, but excluding compensation attributable as having been paid during any month on account of military service creditable under section 3(i) of such Act [ 45 U.S.C. 231b(i) ] if wages are deemed to have been paid to such employee during such month under subsection (a) or (e) of section 417 of this title ) of such employee shall constitute remuneration for employment for purposes of determining (A) entitlement to and the amount of any lump-sum death payment under this subchapter on the basis of such employee’s wages and self-employment income and (B) entitlement to and the amount of any monthly benefit under this subchapter, for the month in which such employee died or for any month thereafter, on the basis of such wages and self-employment income. For such purposes, compensation (as so defined) paid in a calendar year before 1978 shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed to have been paid in equal proportions with respect to all months in the year in which the employee rendered services for such compensation.
