### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 254l–1. National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program
##### (g) Payments

(1) In general

A loan repayment provided for an individual under a written contract under the Loan Repayment Program shall consist of payment, in accordance with paragraph (2), on behalf of the individual of the principal, interest, and related expenses on government and commercial loans received by the individual regarding the undergraduate or graduate education of the individual (or both), which loans were made for

(A) tuition expenses;

(B) all other reasonable educational expenses, including fees, books, and laboratory expenses, incurred by the individual; or

(C) reasonable living expenses as determined by the Secretary.

(2) Payments for years served

(A) In general

For each year of obligated service that an individual contracts to serve under subsection (f) the Secretary may pay up to $50,000, plus, beginning with fiscal year 2012, an amount determined by the Secretary on an annual basis to reflect inflation, on behalf of the individual for loans described in paragraph (1). In making a determination of the amount to pay for a year of such service by an individual, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which each such determination

(i) affects the ability of the Secretary to maximize the number of contracts that can be provided under the Loan Repayment Program from the amounts appropriated for such contracts;

(ii) provides an incentive to serve in health professional shortage areas with the greatest such shortages; and

(iii) provides an incentive with respect to the health professional involved remaining in a health professional shortage area, and continuing to provide primary health services, after the completion of the period of obligated service under the Loan Repayment Program.

(B) Repayment schedule

Any arrangement made by the Secretary for the making of loan repayments in accordance with this subsection shall provide that any repayments for a year of obligated service shall be made no later than the end of the fiscal year in which the individual completes such year of service.

(3) Tax liability

For the purpose of providing reimbursements for tax liability resulting from payments under paragraph (2) on behalf of an individual

(A) the Secretary shall, in addition to such payments, make payments to the individual in an amount equal to 39 percent of the total amount of loan repayments made for the taxable year involved; and

(B) may make such additional payments as the Secretary determines to be appropriate with respect to such purpose.

(4) Payment schedule

The Secretary may enter into an agreement with the holder of any loan for which payments are made under the Loan Repayment Program to establish a schedule for the making of such payments.
