### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 239e. Payment for death
##### (b) Election in case of dependents

(1) In general

In the case of an eligible individual whose death is determined to have resulted from a covered injury or injuries, if the individual had one or more dependents under the age of 18, the legal guardian of the dependents may, in lieu of the death benefit under subsection (a), elect to receive on behalf of the aggregate of such dependents payments in accordance with this subsection. An election under the preceding sentence is effective in lieu of a request under subsection (a) by an individual who is not the legal guardian of such dependents.

(2) Amount of payments

Payments under paragraph (1) with respect to an eligible individual described in such paragraph shall be made as if such individual were an eligible individual to whom compensation would be paid under subsection (a) of section 239d of this title , with the rate augmented in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of such section and with such individual considered to be an eligible individual described in subsection (c)(3)(B) of such section.

(3) Limitations

(A) Age of dependents

No payments may be made under paragraph (1) once the youngest of the dependents involved reaches the age of 18.

(B) Benefits secondary to other coverage

(i) In general

Any payment under paragraph (1) shall be secondary to the obligation of the United States or any third party (including any State or local governmental entity, private insurance carrier, or employer), under any other law or contractual agreement, to pay compensation for loss of employment income or to provide disability benefits, retirement benefits, life insurance benefits on behalf of dependents under the age of 18, or death benefits.

(ii) Relation to other obligations

Payments under paragraph (1) shall not be made to with respect to  2 an eligible individual to the extent that the total of amounts paid with respect to the individual under such paragraph and under the other obligations referred to in clause (i) is an amount that exceeds the rate of payment that applies under paragraph (2). If under any such other obligation a lump-sum payment is made, such payment shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, be deemed to be received over multiple years rather than received in a single year. The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, determine how to apportion such payment over multiple years.
