#### § 18071. Reduced cost-sharing for individuals enrolling in qualified health plans
##### (c) Determination of reduction in cost-sharing

(1) Reduction in out-of-pocket limit

(A) In general

The reduction in cost-sharing under this subsection shall first be achieved by reducing the applicable out-of pocket  1 limit under section 18022(c)(1) of this title in the case of

(i) an eligible insured whose household income is more than 100 percent but not more than 200 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, by two-thirds;

(ii) an eligible insured whose household income is more than 200 percent but not more than 300 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, by one-half; and

(iii) an eligible insured whose household income is more than 300 percent but not more than 400 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, by one-third.

(B) Coordination with actuarial value limits

(i) In general

The Secretary shall ensure the reduction under this paragraph shall not result in an increase in the plan’s share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan above

(I) 94 percent in the case of an eligible insured described in paragraph (2)(A);

(II) 87 percent in the case of an eligible insured described in paragraph (2)(B);

(III) 73 percent in the case of an eligible insured whose household income is more than 200 percent but not more than 250 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved; and

(IV) 70 percent in the case of an eligible insured whose household income is more than 250 percent but not more than 400 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved.

(ii) Adjustment

The Secretary shall adjust the out-of pocket  1 limits under paragraph (1) if necessary to ensure that such limits do not cause the respective actuarial values to exceed the levels specified in clause (i).

(2) Additional reduction for lower income insureds

The Secretary shall establish procedures under which the issuer of a qualified health plan to which this section applies shall further reduce cost-sharing under the plan in a manner sufficient to

(A) in the case of an eligible insured whose household income is not less than 100 percent but not more than 150 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, increase the plan’s share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan to 94 percent of such costs;

(B) in the case of an eligible insured whose household income is more than 150 percent but not more than 200 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, increase the plan’s share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan to 87 percent of such costs; and

(C) in the case of an eligible insured whose household income is more than 200 percent but not more than 250 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, increase the plan’s share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan to 73 percent of such costs.

(3) Methods for reducing cost-sharing

(A) In general

An issuer of a qualified health plan making reductions under this subsection shall notify the Secretary of such reductions and the Secretary shall make periodic and timely payments to the issuer equal to the value of the reductions.

(B) Capitated payments

The Secretary may establish a capitated payment system to carry out the payment of cost-sharing reductions under this section. Any such system shall take into account the value of the reductions and make appropriate risk adjustments to such payments.

(4) Additional benefits

If a qualified health plan under section 18022(b)(5) of this title offers benefits in addition to the essential health benefits required to be provided by the plan, or a State requires a qualified health plan under section 18031(d)(3)(B) of this title to cover benefits in addition to the essential health benefits required to be provided by the plan, the reductions in cost-sharing under this section shall not apply to such additional benefits.

(5) Special rule for pediatric dental plans

If an individual enrolls in both a qualified health plan and a plan described in section 18031(d)(2)(B)(ii)(I)  2 of this title for any plan year, subsection (a) shall not apply to that portion of any reduction in cost-sharing under subsection (c) that (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) is properly allocable to pediatric dental benefits which are included in the essential health benefits required to be provided by a qualified health plan under section 18022(b)(1)(J) of this title .
