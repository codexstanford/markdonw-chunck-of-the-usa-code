######### (i) The Secretary shall waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) in the case of any State that demonstrates to the Secretary that

(I) compliance with subparagraph (A) would be inconsistent with efficient or effective operation of the program operated by such State under this section; or

(II) the amount by which the savings yielded by an alternative cost containment system would be less than the savings yielded by a competitive bidding system is sufficiently minimal that the difference is not significant.

(ii) The Secretary shall prescribe criteria under which a waiver may be granted pursuant to clause (i).

(iii) The Secretary shall provide information on a timely basis to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on waivers that have been granted under clause (i).

(C)

(i) The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to small Indian State agencies carrying out this paragraph in order to assist such agencies to achieve the maximum cost containment savings feasible.

(ii) The Secretary shall also provide technical assistance, on request, to State agencies that desire to consider a cost containment system that covers more than 1 State agency.

(iii) The Secretary may waive the requirement of subparagraph (A) in the case of any Indian State agency that has not more than 1,000 participants.

(D) No State may enter into a cost containment contract (in this subparagraph referred to as the “original contract”) that prescribes conditions that would void, reduce the savings under, or otherwise limit the original contract if the State solicited or secured bids for, or entered into, a subsequent cost containment contract to take effect after the expiration of the original contract.

(E) The Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and State agencies. The Secretary shall make the offer to State agencies once every 12 months. Each such bid solicitation shall only take place if two or more State agencies request the Secretary to perform the solicitation. For such State agencies, the Secretary shall solicit bids and select the winning bidder for a cost containment contract to be entered into by State agencies and infant formula manufacturers or suppliers.

(F) In soliciting bids for contracts for infant formula for the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall solicit bids from infant formula manufacturers under procedures in which bids for rebates or discounts are solicited for milk-based and soy-based infant formula, separately, except where the Secretary determines that such solicitation procedures are not in the best interest of the program.

(G) To reduce the costs of any supplemental foods, the Secretary may make available additional funds to State agencies out of the funds otherwise available under paragraph (1)(A) for nutrition services and administration in an amount not exceeding one half of 1 percent of the amounts to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with innovations in cost containment or associated with procedures that tend to enhance competition.

(H)

(i) Any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity that submits a bid to supply infant formula to carry out the program authorized by this section and announces or otherwise discloses the amount of the bid, or the rebate or discount practices of such entities, in advance of the time the bids are opened by the Secretary or the State agency, or any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity that makes a statement (prior to the opening of bids) relating to levels of rebates or discounts, for the purpose of influencing a bid submitted by any other person, shall be ineligible to submit bids to supply infant formula to the program for the bidding in progress for up to 2 years from the date the bids are opened and shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $100,000,000, as determined by the Secretary to provide restitution to the program for harm done to the program. The Secretary shall issue regulations providing such person, company, corporation, or other legal entity appropriate notice, and an opportunity to be heard and to respond to charges.

(ii) The Secretary shall determine the length of the disqualification, and the amount of the civil penalty referred to in clause (i) based on such factors as the Secretary by regulation determines appropriate.

(iii) Any person, company, corporation, or other legal entity disqualified under clause (i) shall remain obligated to perform any requirements under any contract to supply infant formula existing at the time of the disqualification and until each such contract expires by its terms.

(I) Not later than the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on October 24, 1992 , the Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.

(J) A State shall not incur any interest liability to the Federal Government on rebate funds for infant formula and other foods if all interest earned by the State on the funds is used for program purposes.
