(1) Definitions

In this subsection:

(A) Commissioning

The term “commissioning”, with respect to a facility, means a systematic process

(i) of ensuring, using appropriate verification and documentation, during the period beginning on the initial day of the design phase of the facility and ending not earlier than 1 year after the date of completion of construction of the facility, that all facility systems perform interactively in accordance with

(I) the design documentation and intent of the facility; and

(II) the operational needs of the owner of the facility, including preparation of operation personnel; and

(ii) the primary goal of which is to ensure fully functional systems that can be properly operated and maintained during the useful life of the facility.

(i) In general

The term “energy manager”, with respect to a facility, means the individual who is responsible for

(I) ensuring compliance with this subsection by the facility; and

(II) reducing energy use at the facility.

(ii) Inclusions

The term “energy manager” may include

(I) a contractor of a facility;
