##### (b) Testing of models (phase I)

(1) In general

The CMI shall test payment and service delivery models in accordance with selection criteria under paragraph (2) to determine the effect of applying such models under the applicable subchapter (as defined in subsection (a)(4)(B)) on program expenditures under such subchapters and the quality of care received by individuals receiving benefits under such subchapter.

(2) Selection of models to be tested

(A) In general

The Secretary shall select models to be tested from models where the Secretary determines that there is evidence that the model addresses a defined population for which there are deficits in care leading to poor clinical outcomes or potentially avoidable expenditures.

The models selected under this subparagraph may include, but are not limited to, the models described in subparagraph (B).

(B) Opportunities

The models described in this subparagraph are the following models:
