The sustainable growth rate for all physicians’ services for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1998 and ending with fiscal year 2000) and a year beginning with 2000 and ending with 2014 shall be equal to the product of

(C) 1 plus the Secretary’s estimate of the annual average percentage growth in real gross domestic product per capita (divided by 100) during the 10-year period ending with the applicable period involved, and

(D) 1 plus the Secretary’s estimate of the percentage change (divided by 100) in expenditures for all physicians’ services in the applicable period (compared with the previous applicable period) which will result from changes in law and regulations, determined without taking into account estimated changes in expenditures resulting from the update adjustment factor determined under subsection (d)(3)(B) or (d)(4)(B), as the case may be, minus 1 and multiplied by 100.

(3) Data to be used
