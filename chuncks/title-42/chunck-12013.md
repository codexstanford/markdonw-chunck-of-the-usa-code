(A) an emergency or disaster project; or

(B) a project located in an economically depressed area, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

The non-Federal share shall be in cash or in kind. In determining the amount of the non-Federal share, the Secretary may attribute fair market value to services and facilities contributed from non-Federal sources.

(3) Use of funds for administrative costs

Of the grant amount to be paid under this subsection by the Secretary for a project, not to exceed 13.5 percent shall be available for any fiscal year to pay the administrative costs of such project, except that

(A) the Secretary may increase the amount available to pay the administrative costs to an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the grant amount if the Secretary determines, based on information submitted by the grantee under subsection (b), that such increase is necessary to carry out such project; and
