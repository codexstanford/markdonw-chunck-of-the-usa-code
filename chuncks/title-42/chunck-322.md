#### § 247. Assisting veterans with military emergency medical training to meet requirements for becoming civilian health care professionals
##### (b) Use of funds

Amounts received as a demonstration grant under this section shall be used to

(1) prepare and implement a plan to streamline State requirements and procedures as described in subsection (a), including by

(A) determining the extent to which the requirements for the education, training, and skill level of civilian health care professions (such as emergency medical technicians, paramedics, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, physical therapy assistants, or physician assistants) in the State are equivalent to requirements for the education, training, and skill level of veterans who served in medical related fields while a member of the Armed Forces of the United States; and

(B) identifying methods, such as waivers, for veterans who served in medical related fields while a member of the Armed Forces of the United States to forgo or meet any such equivalent State requirements; and

(2) if necessary to meet workforce shortages or address gaps in education, training, or skill level to meet certification, licensure or other requirements applicable to becoming a civilian health care professional (such as an emergency medical technician, paramedic, licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, physical therapy assistant, or physician assistant professions) in the State, develop or expand career pathways at institutions of higher education to support veterans in meeting such requirements.
