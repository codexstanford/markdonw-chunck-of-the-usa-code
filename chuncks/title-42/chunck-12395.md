#### § 3535. Administrative provisions
##### (m) Occupancy preference in rental housing for military personnel

Whenever he shall determine that, because of location, or other considerations, any rental housing project assisted under title II of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.] or title I of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 could ordinarily be expected substantially to serve the family housing needs of lower income military personnel serving on active duty, the Secretary is authorized to provide for or approve such preference or priority of occupancy of such project by such military personnel as he shall determine is appropriate to assure that the project will serve their needs on a continuing basis notwithstanding the frequency with which individual members of such personnel may be transferred or reassigned to new duty stations.
