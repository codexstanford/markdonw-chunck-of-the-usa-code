Amounts recovered under this section shall be paid to the Secretary and disposed of as follows:

(1)

(A) In the case of amounts recovered arising out of a claim under subchapter XIX, there shall be paid to the State agency an amount bearing the same proportion to the total amount recovered as the State’s share of the amount paid by the State agency for such claim bears to the total amount paid for such claim.

(B) In the case of amounts recovered arising out of a claim under an allotment to a State under subchapter V, there shall be paid to the State agency an amount equal to three-sevenths of the amount recovered.

(2) Such portion of the amounts recovered as is determined to have been paid out of the trust funds under sections 1395i and 1395t of this title shall be repaid to such trust funds.

(3) With respect to amounts recovered arising out of a claim under a Federal health care program (as defined in section 1320a–7b(f) of this title ), the portion of such amounts as is determined to have been paid by the program shall be repaid to the program, and the portion of such amounts attributable to the amounts recovered under this section by reason of the amendments made by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (as estimated by the Secretary) shall be deposited into the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund pursuant to section 1395i(k)(2)(C) of this title .

(4) The remainder of the amounts recovered shall be deposited as miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury of the United States. The amount of such penalty or assessment, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by the United States or a State agency (or, in the case of a penalty or assessment under subsection ( o ), by a specified State agency (as defined in subsection (q)(6)), to the person against whom the penalty or assessment has been assessed.
