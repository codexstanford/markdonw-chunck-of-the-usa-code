(i) 5 In place of the manual medical review process under subparagraph (C)(i), the Secretary shall implement a process for medical review under this subparagraph under which the Secretary shall identify and conduct medical review for services described in subparagraph (C)(i) furnished by a provider of services or supplier (in this subparagraph referred to as a “therapy provider”) using such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(ii) Such factors may include the following:

(I) The therapy provider has had a high claims denial percentage for therapy services under this part or is less compliant with applicable requirements under this subchapter.

(ii) Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed as changing the method of payment for outpatient therapy services under section 1395m(g) of this title .

(7) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (3)(B), with respect to services described in such paragraphs, the requirements described in this paragraph are as follows:

(B) Targeted medical review for certain services above threshold

(i) In general

In the case where expenses that would be incurred for such services would exceed the threshold described in clause (ii) for the year, such services shall be subject to the process for medical review implemented under paragraph (5)(E).

(ii) Threshold

The threshold under this clause for

(I) a year before 2028, is $3,000;

(II) 2028, is the amount specified in subclause (I) increased by the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title ) for 2028; and

(III) a subsequent year, is the amount specified in this clause for the preceding year increased by the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title ) for such subsequent year; except that if an increase under subclause (II) or (III) for a year is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.

(iii) Application

The threshold under clause (ii) shall be applied separately

(I) for physical therapy services and speech-language pathology services; and

(II) for occupational therapy services.

(iv) Funding

For purposes of carrying out this subparagraph, the Secretary shall provide for the transfer, from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1395t of this title to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account, of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 2018, to remain available until expended. Such funds may not be used by a contractor under section 1395ddd(h) of this title for medical reviews under this subparagraph.

(8) With respect to services furnished on or after January 1, 2013 , where payment may not be made as a result of application of paragraphs (1) and (3), section 1395pp of this title shall apply in the same manner as such section applies to a denial that is made by reason of section 1395y(a)(1) of this title .
