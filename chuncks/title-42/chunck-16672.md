(1) Optional baseline for units in certain systems

In the case of a unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of this section which (as of November 15, 1990 )

(A) has an emission rate below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,

(B) has decreased its sulfur dioxide emissions rate by 60 percent or greater since 1980, and

(C) is part of a utility system which has a weighted average sulfur dioxide emissions rate for all fossil fueled-fired units below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu, at the election of the owner or operator of such unit, the unit’s baseline may be calculated (i) as provided under section 7651a(d)  1 of this title, or (ii) by utilizing the unit’s average annual fuel consumption at a 60 percent capacity factor. Such election shall be made no later than March 1, 1991 .

(2) Allowance allocation

Whenever a unit referred to in paragraph (1) elects to calculate its baseline as provided in clause (ii) of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall allocate allowances for the unit pursuant to section 7651b(a)(1) of this title , this section, and section 7651d of this title (as basic Phase II allowance allocations) in an amount equal to the baseline selected multiplied by the lower of the average annual emission rate for such unit in 1989, or 1.0 lbs./mmBtu. Such allowance allocation shall be in lieu of any allocation of allowances under this section and section 7651d of this title .
