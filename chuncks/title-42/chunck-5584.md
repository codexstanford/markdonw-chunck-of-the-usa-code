#### § 415. Computation of primary insurance amount
##### (f) Recomputation of benefits
######## (B) If an individual’s primary insurance amount has been computed under subsection (a)(7) or (d)(3), and it becomes necessary to recompute that primary insurance amount under this subsection

(i) so as to increase the monthly benefit amount payable with respect to such primary insurance amount (except in the case of the individual’s death), such increase shall be determined as though the recomputed primary insurance amount were being computed under subsection (a)(7) or (d)(3), or

(ii) by reason of the individual’s death, such primary insurance amount shall be recomputed without regard to (and as though it had never been computed with regard to) subsection (a)(7) or (d)(3).
