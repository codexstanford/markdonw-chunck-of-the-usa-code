### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396e. Enrollment of individuals under group health plans
##### (c) Premiums considered payments for medical assistance; eligibility
######## (B) If all members of a family are not eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter and enrollment of the members so eligible in a group health plan is not possible without also enrolling members not so eligible

(i) payment of premiums for enrollment of such other members shall be treated as payments for medical assistance for eligible individuals, if it would be cost-effective (taking into account payment of all such premiums), but

(ii) payment of deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations for such other members shall not be treated as payments for medical assistance for eligible individuals.

(2) The fact that an individual is enrolled in a group health plan under this section shall not change the individual’s eligibility for benefits under the State plan, except insofar as section 1396a(a)(25) of this title provides that payment for such benefits shall first be made by such plan.
