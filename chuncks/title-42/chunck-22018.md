#### § 16372. Determination of eligibility and project selection
##### (c) Selection among eligible projects

(1) Establishment of application process

The Secretary shall establish an application process under which projects that are eligible to receive assistance under subsection (b) may

(A) receive credit assistance on terms acceptable to the Secretary, if adequate funds are available (including any funds provided on behalf of an eligible project under paragraph (3)(B)(ii)) to cover the subsidy amount associated with the Federal credit instrument; and

(B) receive grants under section 16374 of this title if

(i) adequate funds are available to cover the amount of the grant; and

(ii) the Secretary determines that the project is eligible under subsection (b).

(2) Priority

In selecting projects to receive credit assistance under subsection (b), the Secretary shall give priority to projects that

(A) are large-capacity, common carrier infrastructure;

(B) have demonstrated demand for use of the infrastructure by associated projects that capture carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources or ambient air;

(C) enable geographical diversity in associated projects that capture carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources or ambient air, with the goal of enabling projects in all major carbon dioxide-emitting regions of the United States; and

(D) are sited within, or adjacent to, existing pipeline or other linear infrastructure corridors, in a manner that minimizes environmental disturbance and other siting concerns.

(3) Master credit agreements

(A) Priority projects

The Secretary may enter into a master credit agreement for a project that the Secretary determines

(i) will likely be eligible for credit assistance under subsection (b), on obtaining

(I) additional commitments from associated carbon capture projects to use the project; or

(II) all necessary permits and approvals; and

(ii) is a project of high priority, as determined in accordance with the criteria described in paragraph (2).

(B) Adequate funding not available

If the Secretary fully obligates funding to eligible projects for a fiscal year and adequate funding is not available to fund a Federal credit instrument, a project sponsor (including a unit of State or local government) of an eligible project may elect

(i)

(I) to enter into a master credit agreement in lieu of the Federal credit instrument; and

(II) to wait to execute a Federal credit instrument until the fiscal year for which additional funds are available to receive credit assistance; or

(ii) if the lack of adequate funding is solely with respect to amounts available for the subsidy amount, to pay the subsidy amount to fund the Federal credit instrument.
