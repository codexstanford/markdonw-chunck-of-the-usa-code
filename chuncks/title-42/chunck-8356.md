#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (t) Payments to encourage adoption and use of certified EHR technology
######## (D) In no case may the payments described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(B) be paid

(i) for any year beginning after 2016 unless the provider has been provided payment under paragraph (1)(B) for the previous year; and

(ii) over a period of more than 6 years of payment.

(6) Payments described in paragraph (1) are not in accordance with this subsection unless the following requirements are met:

(A)

(i) The State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that amounts received under subsection (a)(3)(F) with respect to payments to a Medicaid provider are paid, subject to clause (ii), directly to such provider (or to an employer or facility to which such provider has assigned payments) without any deduction or rebate.

(ii) Amounts described in clause (i) may also be paid to an entity promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology, as designated by the State, if participation in such a payment arrangement is voluntary for the eligible professional involved and if such entity does not retain more than 5 percent of such payments for costs not related to certified EHR technology (and support services including maintenance and training) that is for, or is necessary for the operation of, such technology.

(B) A Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A) is responsible for payment of the remaining 15 percent of the net average allowable cost and shall be determined to have met such responsibility to the extent that the payment to the Medicaid provider is not in excess of 85 percent of the net average allowable cost.

(C)

(i) Subject to clause (ii), with respect to payments to a Medicaid provider

(I) for the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, the Medicaid provider demonstrates that it is engaged in efforts to adopt, implement, or upgrade certified EHR technology; and

(II) for a year of payment, other than the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, the Medicaid provider demonstrates meaningful use of certified EHR technology through a means that is approved by the State and acceptable to the Secretary, and that may be based upon the methodologies applied under section 1395w–4( o ) or 1395ww(n) of this title.

(ii) In the case of a Medicaid provider who has completed adopting, implementing, or upgrading such technology prior to the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, clause (i)(I) shall not apply and clause (i)(II) shall apply to each year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, including the first year of payment.

(D) To the extent specified by the Secretary, the certified EHR technology is compatible with State or Federal administrative management systems. For purposes of subparagraph (B), a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A) may accept payments for the costs described in such subparagraph from a State or local government. For purposes of subparagraph (C), in establishing the means described in such subparagraph, which may include clinical quality reporting to the State, the State shall ensure that populations with unique needs, such as children, are appropriately addressed.

(7) With respect to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall ensure coordination of payment with respect to such providers under sections 1395w–4( o ) and 1395w–23( l ) of this title and under this subsection to assure no duplication of funding. Such coordination shall include, to the extent practicable, a data matching process between State Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services using national provider identifiers. For such purposes, the Secretary may require the submission of such data relating to payments to such Medicaid providers as the Secretary may specify.

(8) In carrying out paragraph (6)(C), the State and Secretary shall seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid duplicative requirements from Federal and State governments to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology under this subchapter and subchapter XVIII. In doing so, the Secretary may deem satisfaction of requirements for such meaningful use for a payment year under subchapter XVIII to be sufficient to qualify as meaningful use under this subsection. The Secretary may also specify the reporting periods under this subsection in order to carry out this paragraph.

(9) In order to be provided Federal financial participation under subsection (a)(3)(F)(ii), a State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the State

(A) is using the funds provided for the purposes of administering payments under this subsection, including tracking of meaningful use by Medicaid providers;

(B) is conducting adequate oversight of the program under this subsection, including routine tracking of meaningful use attestations and reporting mechanisms; and

(C) is pursuing initiatives to encourage the adoption of certified EHR technology to promote health care quality and the exchange of health care information under this subchapter, subject to applicable laws and regulations governing such exchange.

(10) The Secretary shall periodically submit reports to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on status, progress, and oversight of payments described in paragraph (1), including steps taken to carry out paragraph (7). Such reports shall also describe the extent of adoption of certified EHR technology among Medicaid providers resulting from the provisions of this subsection and any improvements in health outcomes, clinical quality, or efficiency resulting from such adoption.
