### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (f) Standards for furnaces and boilers

(1) Furnaces (other than furnaces designed solely for installation in mobile homes) manufactured on or after January 1, 1992 , shall have an annual fuel utilization efficiency of not less than 78 percent, except that

(A) boilers (other than gas steam boilers) shall have an annual fuel utilization efficiency of not less than 80 percent and gas steam boilers shall have an annual fuel utilization efficiency of not less than 75 percent; and

(B) the Secretary shall prescribe a final rule not later than January 1, 1989 , establishing an energy conservation standard

(i) which is for furnaces (other than furnaces designed solely for installation in mobile homes) having an input of less than 45,000 Btu per hour and manufactured on or after January 1, 1992 ;

(ii) which provides that the annual fuel utilization efficiency of such furnaces shall be a specific percent which is not less than 71 percent and not more than 78 percent; and

(iii) which the Secretary determines is not likely to result in a significant shift from gas heating to electric resistance heating with respect to either residential construction or furnace replacement.

(2) Furnaces which are designed solely for installation in mobile homes and which are manufactured on or after September 1, 1990 , shall have an annual fuel utilization efficiency of not less than 75 percent.

(3) Boilers.

(A) In general .

Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), boilers manufactured on or after September 1, 2012 , shall meet the following requirements: Boiler Type

Minimum Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency

Design Requirements

Gas Hot Water

82%

No Constant Burning Pilot, Automatic Means for Adjusting Water Temperature

Gas Steam

80%

No Constant Burning Pilot

Oil Hot Water

84%

Automatic Means for Adjusting Temperature

Oil Steam

82%

None

Electric Hot Water

None

Automatic Means for Adjusting Temperature

Electric Steam

None

None

(B) Automatic means for adjusting water temperature.

(i) In general .

The manufacturer shall equip each gas, oil, and electric hot water boiler (other than a boiler equipped with a tankless domestic water heating coil) with automatic means for adjusting the temperature of the water supplied by the boiler to ensure that an incremental change in inferred heat load produces a corresponding incremental change in the temperature of water supplied.

(ii) Single input rate .

For a boiler that fires at 1 input rate, the requirements of this subparagraph may be satisfied by providing an automatic means that allows the burner or heating element to fire only when the means has determined that the inferred heat load cannot be met by the residual heat of the water in the system.

(iii) No inferred heat load .

When there is no inferred heat load with respect to a hot water boiler, the automatic means described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall limit the temperature of the water in the boiler to not more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

(iv) Operation .

A boiler described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be operable only when the automatic means described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) is installed.

(C) Exception .

A boiler that is manufactured to operate without any need for electricity or any electric connection, electric gauges, electric pumps, electric wires, or electric devices shall not be required to meet the requirements of this paragraph.

(4)

(A) The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than January 1, 1992 , to determine whether the standards established by paragraph (2) for mobile home furnaces should be amended. Such rule shall provide that any amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 1994 .

(B) The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than January 1, 1994 , to determine whether the standards established by this subsection for furnaces (including mobile home furnaces) should be amended. Such rule shall provide that any amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 2002 .

(C) After January 1, 1997 , and before January 1, 2007 , the Secretary shall publish a final rule to determine whether standards in effect for such products should be amended. Such rule shall contain such amendment, if any, and provide that any amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 2012 .

(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the requirements of subsection ( o ) are met, not later than December 31, 2013 , the Secretary shall consider and prescribe energy conservation standards or energy use standards for electricity used for purposes of circulating air through duct work.
