#### § 6924. Standards applicable to owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities
##### (f) Disposal into deep injection wells; specified subsection (d) wastes; solvents and dioxins

(1) Not later than forty-five months after November 8, 1984 , the Administrator shall complete a review of the disposal of all hazardous wastes referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (d) and in paragraph (2) of subsection (e) by underground injection into deep injection wells.

(2) Within forty-five months after November 8, 1984 , the Administrator shall make a determination regarding the disposal by underground injection into deep injection wells of the hazardous wastes referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (d) and the hazardous wastes referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (e). The Administrator shall promulgate final regulations prohibiting the disposal of such wastes into such wells if it may reasonably be determined that such disposal may not be protective of human health and the environment for as long as the waste remains hazardous, taking into account the factors referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of subsection (d)(1). In promulgating such regulations, the Administrator shall consider each hazardous waste referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (d) or in paragraph (2) of subsection (e) which is prohibited from disposal into such wells by any State.

(3) If the Administrator fails to make a determination under paragraph (2) for any hazardous waste referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (d) or in paragraph (2) of subsection (e) within forty-five months after November 8, 1984 , such hazardous waste shall be prohibited from disposal into any deep injection well.

(4) As used in this subsection, the term “deep injection well” means a well used for the underground injection of hazardous waste other than a well to which section 6979a(a)  1 of this title applies.
