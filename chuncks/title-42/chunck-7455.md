### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–4. Payment for physicians’ services
##### (c) Determination of relative values for physicians’ services

(1) Division of physicians’ services into components

In this section, with respect to a physicians’ service:

(A) “Work component” defined

The term “work component” means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects physician time and intensity in furnishing the service. Such portion shall

(i) include activities before and after direct patient contact, and

(ii) be defined, with respect to surgical procedures, to reflect a global definition including pre-operative and post-operative physicians’ services.

(B) “Practice expense component” defined

The term “practice expense component” means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects the general categories of expenses (such as office rent and wages of personnel, but excluding malpractice expenses) comprising practice expenses.

(C) “Malpractice component” defined

The term “malpractice component” means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects malpractice expenses in furnishing the service.

(2) Determination of relative values

(A) In general

(i) Combination of units for components

The Secretary shall develop a methodology for combining the work, practice expense, and malpractice relative value units, determined under subparagraph (C), for each service in a manner to produce a single relative value for that service. Such relative values are subject to adjustment under subparagraph (F)(i) and section 13515(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

(ii) Extrapolation

The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine the number of relative value units for physicians’ services for which specific data are not available and shall take into account recommendations of the Physician Payment Review Commission and the results of consultations with organizations representing physicians who provide such services.

(B) Periodic review and adjustments in relative values

(i) Periodic review

The Secretary, not less often than every 5 years, shall review the relative values established under this paragraph for all physicians’ services.

(ii) Adjustments

(I) In general

The Secretary shall, to the extent the Secretary determines to be necessary and subject to subclause (II) and paragraph (7), adjust the number of such units to take into account changes in medical practice, coding changes, new data on relative value components, or the addition of new procedures. The Secretary shall publish an explanation of the basis for such adjustments.

(II) Limitation on annual adjustments

Subject to clauses (iv) and (v), the adjustments under subclause (I) for a year may not cause the amount of expenditures under this part for the year to differ by more than $20,000,000 from the amount of expenditures under this part that would have been made if such adjustments had not been made.

(iii) Consultation

The Secretary, in making adjustments under clause (ii), shall consult with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and organizations representing physicians.

(iv) Exemption of certain additional expenditures from budget neutrality

The additional expenditures attributable to

(I) subparagraph (H) shall not be taken into account in applying clause (ii)(II) for 2004;

(II) subparagraph (I) insofar as it relates to a physician fee schedule for 2005 or 2006 shall not be taken into account in applying clause (ii)(II) for drug administration services under the fee schedule for such year for a specialty described in subparagraph (I)(ii)(II);

(III) subparagraph (J) insofar as it relates to a physician fee schedule for 2005 or 2006 shall not be taken into account in applying clause (ii)(II) for drug administration services under the fee schedule for such year;

(IV) subsection (b)(6) shall not be taken into account in applying clause (ii)(II) for 2010, 2011, or the first 2 months of 2012; and

(V) subsection (t) shall not be taken into account in applying clause (ii)(II) for 2021 or 2022.

(v) Exemption of certain reduced expenditures from budget-neutrality calculation

The following reduced expenditures, as estimated by the Secretary, shall not be taken into account in applying clause (ii)(II):

(I) Reduced payment for multiple imaging procedures

Effective for fee schedules established beginning with 2007, reduced expenditures attributable to the multiple procedure payment reduction for imaging under the final rule published by the Secretary in the Federal Register on November 21, 2005 (42 CFR 405, et al.) insofar as it relates to the physician fee schedules for 2006 and 2007.

(II) OPD payment cap for imaging services

Effective for fee schedules established beginning with 2007, reduced expenditures attributable to subsection (b)(4).

Notwithstanding subsection (d)(9)(A), effective for fee schedules established beginning with 2009, with respect to the 5-year review of work relative value units used in fee schedules for 2007 and 2008, in lieu of continuing to apply budget-neutrality adjustments required under clause (ii) for 2007 and 2008 to work relative value units, the Secretary shall apply such budget-neutrality adjustments to the conversion factor otherwise determined for years beginning with 2009.

(C) Computation of relative value units for components

For purposes of this section for each physicians’ service

(i) Work relative value units

The Secretary shall determine a number of work relative value units for the service or group of services based on the relative resources incorporating physician time and intensity required in furnishing the service or group of services.

(ii) Practice expense relative value units

The Secretary shall determine a number of practice expense relative value units for the service for years before 1999 equal to the product of

(I) the base allowed charges (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the service, and

(II) the practice expense percentage for the service (as determined under paragraph (3)(C)(ii)),  and for years beginning with 1999 based on the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service or group of services. For 1999, such number of units shall be determined based 75 percent on such product and based 25 percent on the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service. For 2000, such number of units shall be determined based 50 percent on such product and based 50 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For 2001, such number of units shall be determined based 25 percent on such product and based 75 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For a subsequent year, such number of units shall be determined based entirely on such relative practice expense resources.

(iii) Malpractice relative value units

The Secretary shall determine a number of malpractice relative value units for the service or group of services for years before 2000 equal to the product of

(I) the base allowed charges (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the service or group of services, and

(II) the malpractice percentage for the service or group of services (as determined under paragraph (3)(C)(iii)),  and for years beginning with 2000 based on the malpractice expense resources involved in furnishing the service or group of services.

(D) “Base allowed charges” defined

In this paragraph, the term “base allowed charges” means, with respect to a physician’s service, the national average allowed charges for the service under this part for services furnished during 1991, as estimated by the Secretary using the most recent data available.

(E) Reduction in practice expense relative value units for certain services

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall reduce the practice expense relative value units applied to services described in clause (iii) furnished in

(I) 1994, by 25 percent of the number by which the number of practice expense relative value units (determined for 1994 without regard to this subparagraph) exceeds the number of work relative value units determined for 1994,

(II) 1995, by an additional 25 percent of such excess, and

(III) 1996, by an additional 25 percent of such excess.

(ii) Floor on reductions

The practice expense relative value units for a physician’s service shall not be reduced under this subparagraph to a number less than 128 percent of the number of work relative value units.

(iii) Services covered

For purposes of clause (i), the services described in this clause are physicians’ services that are not described in clause (iv) and for which

(I) there are work relative value units, and

(II) the number of practice expense relative value units (determined for 1994) exceeds 128 percent of the number of work relative value units (determined for such year).

(iv) Excluded services

For purposes of clause (iii), the services described in this clause are services which the Secretary determines at least 75 percent of which are provided under this subchapter in an office setting.

(F) Budget neutrality adjustments

The Secretary

(i) shall reduce the relative values for all services (other than anesthesia services) established under this paragraph (and, in the case of anesthesia services, the conversion factor established by the Secretary for such services) by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be necessary so that, beginning in 1996, the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made, and

(ii) shall reduce the amounts determined under subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be required to assure that, taking into account the reductions made under clause (i), the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section in 1994 that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made.

(G) Adjustments in relative value units for 1998

(i) In general

The Secretary shall

(I) subject to clauses (iv) and (v), reduce the practice expense relative value units applied to any services described in clause (ii) furnished in 1998 to a number equal to 110 percent of the number of work relative value units, and

(II) increase the practice expense relative value units for office visit procedure codes during 1998 by a uniform percentage which the Secretary estimates will result in an aggregate increase in payments for such services equal to the aggregate decrease in payments by reason of subclause (I).

(N) Authority for alternative approaches to establishing practice expense relative values

The Secretary may establish or adjust practice expense relative values under this subsection using cost, charge, or other data from suppliers or providers of services, including information collected or obtained under subparagraph (M).

(O) Target for relative value adjustments for misvalued services

With respect to fee schedules established for each of 2016 through 2018, the following shall apply:

(i) Determination of net reduction in expenditures

For each year, the Secretary shall determine the estimated net reduction in expenditures under the fee schedule under this section with respect to the year as a result of adjustments to the relative values established under this paragraph for misvalued codes.

(ii) Budget neutral redistribution of funds if target met and counting overages towards the target for the succeeding year

If the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year is equal to or greater than the target for the year

(I) reduced expenditures attributable to such adjustments shall be redistributed for the year in a budget neutral manner in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii)(II); and

(II) the amount by which such reduced expenditures exceeds the target for the year shall be treated as a reduction in expenditures described in clause (i) for the succeeding year, for purposes of determining whether the target has or has not been met under this subparagraph with respect to that year.

(iii) Exemption from budget neutrality if target not met

If the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year is less than the target for the year, reduced expenditures in an amount equal to the target recapture amount shall not be taken into account in applying subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) with respect to fee schedules beginning with 2016.

(iv) Target recapture amount

For purposes of clause (iii), the target recapture amount is, with respect to a year, an amount equal to the difference between

(I) the target for the year; and

(II) the estimated net reduction in expenditures determined under clause (i) for the year.

(v) Target

For purposes of this subparagraph, with respect to a year, the target is calculated as 0.5 percent (or, for 2016, 1.0 percent) of the estimated amount of expenditures under the fee schedule under this section for the year.

(3) Component percentages

For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine a work percentage, a practice expense percentage, and a malpractice percentage for each physician’s service as follows:

(A) Division of services by specialty

For each physician’s service or class of physicians’ services, the Secretary shall determine the average percentage of each such service or class of services that is performed, nationwide, under this part by physicians in each of the different physician specialties (as identified by the Secretary).

(B) Division of specialty by component

The Secretary shall determine the average percentage division of resources, among the work component, the practice expense component, and the malpractice component, used by physicians in each of such specialties in furnishing physicians’ services. Such percentages shall be based on national data that describe the elements of physician practice costs and revenues, by physician specialty. The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine practice costs and revenues for specialties for which adequate data are not available.

(C) Determination of component percentages

(i) Work percentage

The work percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of

(I) the average percentage division for the work component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

(II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.

(ii) Practice expense percentage

For years before 2002, the practice expense percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of

(I) the average percentage division for the practice expense component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

(II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.

(iii) Malpractice percentage

For years before 1999, the malpractice percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of

(I) the average percentage division for the malpractice component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by

(II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.

(D) Periodic recomputation

The Secretary may, from time to time, provide for the recomputation of work percentages, practice expense percentages, and malpractice percentages determined under this paragraph.

(4) Ancillary policies

The Secretary may establish ancillary policies (with respect to the use of modifiers, local codes, and other matters) as may be necessary to implement this section.

(5) Coding

The Secretary shall establish a uniform procedure coding system for the coding of all physicians’ services. The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate coding structure for visits and consultations. The Secretary may incorporate the use of time in the coding for visits and consultations. The Secretary, in establishing such coding system, shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and other organizations representing physicians.

(6) No variation for specialists

The Secretary may not vary the conversion factor or the number of relative value units for a physicians’ service based on whether the physician furnishing the service is a specialist or based on the type of specialty of the physician.

(7) Phase-in of significant relative value unit (RVU) reductions

Effective for fee schedules established beginning with 2016, for services that are not new or revised codes, if the total relative value units for a service for a year would otherwise be decreased by an estimated amount equal to or greater than 20 percent as compared to the total relative value units for the previous year, the applicable adjustments in work, practice expense, and malpractice relative value units shall be phased-in over a 2-year period.

(8) Global surgical packages

(A) Prohibition of implementation of rule regarding global surgical packages

(i) In general

The Secretary shall not implement the policy established in the final rule published on November 13, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 67548 et seq.), that requires the transition of all 10-day and 90-day global surgery packages to 0-day global periods.

(ii) Construction

Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from revaluing misvalued codes for specific surgical services or assigning values to new or revised codes for surgical services.

(B) Collection of data on services included in global surgical packages

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall through rulemaking develop and implement a process to gather, from a representative sample of physicians, beginning not later than January 1, 2017 , information needed to value surgical services. Such information shall include the number and level of medical visits furnished during the global period and other items and services related to the surgery and furnished during the global period, as appropriate. Such information shall be reported on claims at the end of the global period or in another manner specified by the Secretary. For purposes of carrying out this paragraph (other than clause (iii)), the Secretary shall transfer from the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1395t of this title $2,000,000 to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account for fiscal year 2015. Amounts transferred under the previous sentence shall remain available until expended.

(ii) Reassessment and potential sunset

Every 4 years, the Secretary shall reassess the value of the information collected pursuant to clause (i). Based on such a reassessment and by regulation, the Secretary may discontinue the requirement for collection of information under such clause if the Secretary determines that the Secretary has adequate information from other sources, such as qualified clinical data registries, surgical logs, billing systems or other practice or facility records, and electronic health records, in order to accurately value global surgical services under this section.

(iii) Inspector general audit
