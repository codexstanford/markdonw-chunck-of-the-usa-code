(A)

(i) Except as provided by subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall allocate assistance referred to in subsection (a)(1) the first time it is available for reservation on the basis of a formula that is contained in a regulation prescribed by the Secretary, and that is based on the relative needs of different States, areas, and communities, as reflected in data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies, amount of substandard housing, and other objectively measurable conditions specified in the regulation. The Secretary may allocate assistance under the preceding sentence in such a manner that each State shall receive not less than one-half of one percent of the amount of funds available for each program referred to in subsection (a)(1) in each fiscal year. In allocating assistance under this paragraph for each program of housing assistance under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall apply the formula, to the extent practicable, in a manner so that the assistance under the program is allocated according to the particular relative needs under the preceding sentence that are characteristic of and related to the particular type of assistance provided under the program. Assistance under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [ 12 U.S.C. 1701q ] shall be allocated in a manner that ensures that awards of the assistance under such section are made for projects of sufficient size to accommodate facilities for supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly residents. The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c)  3 of title 12. Amounts for tenant-based assistance under section 8( o ) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ( o )] may not be provided to any public housing agency that has been disqualified from providing such assistance.

(ii) Assistance under section 8( o ) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ( o )] shall be allocated in a manner that enables participating jurisdictions to carry out, to the maximum extent practicable, comprehensive housing affordability strategies approved in accordance with section 105 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [ 42 U.S.C. 12705 ]. Such jurisdictions shall submit recommendations for allocating assistance under such section 8( o ) to the Secretary in accordance with procedures that the Secretary determines to be appropriate to permit allocations of such assistance to be made on the basis of timely and complete information. This clause may not be construed to prevent, alter, or otherwise affect the application of the formula established pursuant to clause (i) for purposes of allocating such assistance. For purposes of this clause, the term “participating jurisdiction” means a State or unit of general local government designated by the Secretary to be a participating jurisdiction under title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [ 42 U.S.C. 12721 et seq.].
