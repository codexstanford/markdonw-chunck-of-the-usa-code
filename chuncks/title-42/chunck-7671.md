##### (c) Enrollment and enrollment fees

(1) Enrollment process

The Secretary shall establish a process through which a discount card eligible individual is enrolled and disenrolled in an endorsed discount card program under this section consistent with the following:

(A) Continuous open enrollment

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this paragraph and subsection (h)(9), a discount card eligible individual who is not enrolled in an endorsed discount card program and is residing in a State may enroll in any such endorsed program

(i) that serves residents of the State; and

(ii) at any time beginning on the initial enrollment date, specified by the Secretary, and before January 1, 2006 .

(B) Use of standard enrollment form

An enrollment in an endorsed program shall only be effected through completion of a standard enrollment form specified by the Secretary. Each sponsor of an endorsed program shall transmit to the Secretary (in a form and manner specified by the Secretary) information on individuals who complete such enrollment forms and, to the extent provided under subsection (f), information regarding certification as a transitional assistance eligible individual.

(C) Enrollment only in one program

(i) In general

Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), a discount card eligible individual may be enrolled in only one endorsed discount card program under this section.

(ii) Change in endorsed program permitted for 2005

The Secretary shall establish a process, similar to (and coordinated with) the process for annual, coordinated elections under section 1395w–21(e)(3) of this title during 2004, under which an individual enrolled in an endorsed discount card program may change the endorsed program in which the individual is enrolled for 2005.

(iii) Additional exceptions

The Secretary shall permit an individual to change the endorsed discount card program in which the individual is enrolled in the case of an individual who changes residence to be outside the service area of such program and in such other exceptional cases as the Secretary may provide (taking into account the circumstances for special election periods under section 1395w–21(e)(4) of this title ). Under the previous sentence, the Secretary may consider a change in residential setting (such as placement in a nursing facility) or enrollment in or disenrollment from a plan under part C through which the individual was enrolled in an endorsed program to be an exceptional circumstance.

(D) Disenrollment

(i) Voluntary

An individual may voluntarily disenroll from an endorsed discount card program at any time. In the case of such a voluntary disenrollment, the individual may not enroll in another endorsed program, except under such exceptional circumstances as the Secretary may recognize under subparagraph (C)(iii) or during the annual coordinated enrollment period provided under subparagraph (C)(ii).

(ii) Involuntary

An individual who is enrolled in an endorsed discount card program and not a transitional assistance eligible individual may be disenrolled by the sponsor of the program if the individual fails to pay any annual enrollment fee required under the program.

(E) Application to certain enrollees

In the case of a discount card eligible individual who is enrolled in a plan described in section 1395w–21(a)(2)(A) of this title or under a reasonable cost reimbursement contract under section 1395mm(h) of this title that is offered by an organization that also is a prescription discount card sponsor that offers an endorsed discount card program under which the individual may be enrolled and that has made an election to apply the special rules under subsection (h)(9)(B) for such an endorsed program, the individual may only enroll in such an endorsed discount card program offered by that sponsor.

(2) Enrollment fees

(A) In general

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this paragraph, a prescription drug card sponsor may charge an annual enrollment fee for each discount card eligible individual enrolled in an endorsed discount card program offered by such sponsor. The annual enrollment fee for either 2004 or 2005 shall not be prorated for portions of a year. There shall be no annual enrollment fee for a year after 2005.

(B) Amount

No annual enrollment fee charged under subparagraph (A) may exceed $30.

(C) Uniform enrollment fee

A prescription drug card sponsor shall ensure that the annual enrollment fee (if any) for an endorsed discount card program is the same for all discount card eligible individuals enrolled in the program and residing in the State.

(D) Collection

The annual enrollment fee (if any) charged for enrollment in an endorsed program shall be collected by the sponsor of the program.

(E) Payment of fee for transitional assistance eligible individuals

Under subsection (g)(1)(A), the annual enrollment fee (if any) otherwise charged under this paragraph with respect to a transitional assistance eligible individual shall be paid by the Secretary on behalf of such individual.

(F) Optional payment of fee by State

(i) In general

The Secretary shall establish an arrangement under which a State may provide for payment of some or all of the enrollment fee for some or all enrollees who are not transitional assistance eligible individuals in the State, as specified by the State under the arrangement. Insofar as such a payment arrangement is made with respect to an enrollee, the amount of the enrollment fee shall be paid directly by the State to the sponsor.

(ii) No Federal matching available under medicaid or SCHIP

Expenditures made by a State for enrollment fees described in clause (i) shall not be treated as State expenditures for purposes of Federal matching payments under subchapter XIX or XXI.

(G) Rules in case of changes in program enrollment during a year

The Secretary shall provide special rules in the case of payment of an annual enrollment fee for a discount card eligible individual who changes the endorsed program in which the individual is enrolled during a year.

(3) Issuance of discount card

Each prescription drug card sponsor of an endorsed discount card program shall issue, in a standard format specified by the Secretary, to each discount card eligible individual enrolled in such program a card that establishes proof of enrollment and that can be used in a coordinated manner to identify the sponsor, program, and individual for purposes of the program under this section.

(4) Period of access

In the case of a discount card eligible individual who enrolls in an endorsed program, access to negotiated prices and transitional assistance, if any, under such endorsed program shall take effect on such date as the Secretary shall specify.
