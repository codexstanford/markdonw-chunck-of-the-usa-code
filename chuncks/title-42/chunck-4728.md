### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300ff–31a. Timeframe for obligation and expenditure of grant funds
##### (c) Formula grants; cancellation of unobligated balance of grant award; waiver permitting carryover

(1) In general

Effective for fiscal year 2007 and subsequent fiscal years, if a grant award made to a State for a fiscal year pursuant to section 300ff–28(a)(1) or 300ff–28(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title has an unobligated balance as of the end of the grant year for the award, the Secretary shall cancel that unobligated balance of the award, and shall require the State to return any amounts from such balance that have been disbursed to the State, unless

(A) before the end of the grant year, the State submits to the Secretary a written application for a waiver of the cancellation, which application includes a description of the purposes for which the State intends to expend the funds involved; and

(B) the Secretary approves the waiver.

(2) Expenditure by end of carryover year

With respect to a waiver under paragraph (1) that is approved for a balance that is unobligated as of the end of a grant year for an award:

(A) The unobligated funds are available for expenditure by the State involved for the one-year period beginning upon the expiration of the grant year (referred to in this section as the “carryover year”).

(B) If the funds are not expended by the end of the carryover year, the Secretary shall cancel that unexpended balance of the award, and shall require the State to return any amounts from such balance that have been disbursed to the State.

(3) Use of cancelled balances

In the case of any balance of a grant award that is cancelled under paragraph (1) or (2)(B), the grant funds involved shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants under section 300ff–29a of this title for the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the Secretary obtains the information necessary for determining that the balance is required under such paragraph to be canceled, except that the availability of the funds for such grants is subject to section 300ff–28(a)(2)(H) of this title as applied for such year.

(4) Corresponding reduction in future grant

(A) In general

In the case of a State for which a balance from a grant award made pursuant to section 300ff–28(a)(1) or 300ff–28(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title is unobligated as of the end of the grant year for the award

(i) the Secretary shall reduce, by the same amount as such unobligated balance (less any amount of such balance that is the subject of a waiver of cancellation under paragraph (1)), the amount of the grant under such section for the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the Secretary obtains the information necessary for determining that such balance was unobligated as of the end of the grant year (which requirement for a reduction applies without regard to whether a waiver under paragraph (1) has been approved with respect to such balance); and

(ii) the grant funds involved in such reduction shall be made available by the Secretary as additional funds for grants under section 300ff–29a of this title for such first fiscal year, subject to section 300ff–28(a)(2)(H) of this title ; except that this subparagraph does not apply to the State if the amount of the unobligated balance was 5 percent or less.

(B) Relation to increases in grant

A reduction under subparagraph (A) for a State for a fiscal year may not be taken into account in applying section 300ff–28(a)(2)(H) of this title with respect to the State for the subsequent fiscal year.
