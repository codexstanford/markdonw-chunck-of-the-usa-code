#### § 18934. Biometrics research and testing
##### (a) In general

The Secretary, acting through the Director, shall establish a program to support measurement research to inform the development of best practices, benchmarks, methodologies, procedures, and voluntary, consensus-based technical standards for biometric identification systems, including facial recognition systems, to assess and improve the performance of such systems. In carrying out such program, the Director may

(1) conduct measurement research to support efforts to improve the performance of biometric identification systems, including in areas related to conformity assessment, image quality and interoperability, contactless biometric capture technologies, and human-in-the-loop biometric identification systems and processes;

(2) convene and engage with relevant stakeholders to establish common definitions and characterizations for biometric identification systems, which may include accuracy, fairness, bias, privacy, consent, and other properties, taking into account definitions in relevant international technical standards and other publications;

(3) carry out measurement research and testing on a range of biometric modalities, such as fingerprints, voice, iris, face, vein, behavioral biometrics, genetics, multimodal biometrics, and emerging applications of biometric identification technology;

(4) study the use of privacy-enhancing technologies and other technical protective controls to facilitate access, as appropriate, to public data sets for biometric research;

(5) conduct outreach and coordination to share technical expertise with relevant industry and nonindustry stakeholders and standards development organizations to assist such entities in the development of best practices and voluntary technical standards; and

(6) develop such standard reference artifacts as the Director determines is necessary to further the development of such voluntary technical standards.
