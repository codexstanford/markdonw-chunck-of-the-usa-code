(ii) Review

The Administrator may

(I) review the exchange values listed in the tables contained in clause (i) on a periodic basis; and

(II) subject to notice and opportunity for public comment, adjust the exchange values solely on the basis of

(aa) the best available science; and

(bb) other information consistent with widely used or commonly accepted existing exchange values.

(2) Production and consumption phase-down

(A) In general

During the period beginning on January 1 of each year listed in the table contained in subparagraph (C) and ending on December 31 of the year before the next year listed on that table, except as otherwise permitted under this section, no person shall

(i) produce a quantity of a regulated substance without a corresponding quantity of production allowances, except as provided in paragraph (5);

(ii) consume a quantity of a regulated substance without a corresponding quantity of consumption allowances; or

(iii) hold, use, or transfer any production allowance or consumption allowance allocated under this section except in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (g).

(B) Compliance

For each year listed on the table contained in subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall ensure that the annual quantity of all regulated substances produced or consumed in the United States does not exceed the product obtained by multiplying

(i) the production baseline or consumption baseline, as applicable; and

(ii) the applicable percentage listed on the table contained in subparagraph (C).

(C) Relation to baseline

On January 1 of each year listed in the following table, the Administrator shall apply the applicable percentage, as described in subparagraph (A): Date

(D) Allowances

(i) Quantity

Not later than October 1 of each calendar year, the Administrator shall use the quantity calculated under subparagraph (B) to determine the quantity of allowances for the production and consumption of regulated substances that may be used for the following calendar year.

(ii) Nature of allowances

(I) In general

An allowance allocated under this section

(aa) does not constitute a property right; and

(bb) is a limited authorization for the production or consumption of a regulated substance under this section.

(II) Savings provision

Nothing in this section or in any other provision of law limits the authority of the United States to terminate or limit an authorization described in subclause (I)(bb).

(3) Regulations regarding production and consumption of regulated substances

Not later than 270 days after December 27, 2020 , which shall include a period of notice and opportunity for public comment, the Administrator shall issue a final rule

(A) phasing down the production of regulated substances in the United States through an allowance allocation and trading program in accordance with this section; and

(B) phasing down the consumption of regulated substances in the United States through an allowance allocation and trading program in accordance with the schedule under paragraph (2)(C) (subject to the same exceptions and other requirements as are applicable to the phase-down of production of regulated substances under this section).

(4) Exceptions; essential uses

(A) Feedstocks and process agents

Except for the reporting requirements described in subsection (d)(1), this section does not apply to

(i) a regulated substance that is used and entirely consumed (except for trace quantities) in the manufacture of another chemical; or
