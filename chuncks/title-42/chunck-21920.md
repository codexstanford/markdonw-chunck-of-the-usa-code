### CHAPTER 149— NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY AND PROGRAMS
#### § 16298d. Carbon removal
##### (e) Air capture prize competitions

(1) Definitions

In this subsection:

(A) Dilute media

The term “dilute media” means media in which the concentration of carbon dioxide is less than 1 percent by volume.

(B) Prize competition

The term “prize competition” means the competitive technology prize competition established under paragraph (2).

(C) Qualified carbon dioxide

(i) In general

The term “qualified carbon dioxide” means any carbon dioxide that

(I) is captured directly from the ambient air; and

(II) is measured at the source of capture and verified at the point of disposal, injection, or utilization.

(ii) Inclusion

The term “qualified carbon dioxide” includes the initial deposit of captured carbon dioxide used as a tertiary injectant.

(iii) Exclusion

The term “qualified carbon dioxide” does not include carbon dioxide that is recaptured, recycled, and reinjected as part of the enhanced oil and natural gas recovery process.

(D) Qualified direct air capture facility

(i) In general

The term “qualified direct air capture facility” means any facility that

(I) uses carbon capture equipment to capture carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air; and

(II) captures more than 50,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide annually.

(ii) Exclusion

The term “qualified direct air capture facility” does not include any facility that captures carbon dioxide

(I) that is deliberately released from naturally occurring subsurface springs; or

(II) using natural photosynthesis.

(2) Establishment

Not later than 2 years after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall establish as part of the program a competitive technology prize competition to award prizes for

(A) precommercial carbon dioxide capture from dilute media; and

(B) commercial applications of direct air capture technologies.

(3) Requirements

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary, in accordance with section 3719 of title 15 , shall develop requirements for

(A) the prize competition process; and

(B) monitoring and verification procedures for projects selected to receive a prize under the prize competition.

(4) Eligible projects

(A) Precommercial air capture projects

With respect to projects described in paragraph (2)(A), to be eligible to be awarded a prize under the prize competition, a project shall

(i) meet minimum performance standards set by the Secretary;

(ii) meet minimum levels set by the Secretary for the capture of carbon dioxide from dilute media; and

(iii) demonstrate in the application of the project for a prize

(I) a design for a promising carbon capture technology that will

(aa) be operated on a demonstration scale; and

(bb) have the potential to achieve significant reduction in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere;

(II) a successful bench-scale demonstration of a carbon capture technology; or

(III) an operational carbon capture technology on a commercial scale.

(B) Commercial direct air capture projects

(i) In general

With respect to projects described in paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall award prizes under the prize competition to qualified direct air capture facilities for metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide captured and verified at the point of disposal, injection, or utilization.

(ii) Amount of award

The amount of the award per metric ton under clause (i)

(I) shall be equal for each qualified direct air capture facility selected for a prize under the prize competition; and

(II) shall be determined by the Secretary and in any case shall not exceed

(aa) $180 for qualified carbon dioxide captured and stored in saline storage formations;

(bb) a lesser amount, as determined by the Secretary, for qualified carbon dioxide captured and stored in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery operations; or

(cc) a lesser amount, as determined by the Secretary, for qualified carbon dioxide captured and utilized in any activity consistent with section 45Q(f)(5) of title 26 .

(iii) Requirement

The Secretary shall make awards under this subparagraph until appropriated funds are expended.
