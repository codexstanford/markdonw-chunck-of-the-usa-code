#### § 5304. Statement of activities and review
##### (e) Submission of performance and evaluation report by grantee to Secretary; contents; availability for citizen comment; annual review and audit by Secretary of program implementation; adjustments in amount of annual grants

Each grantee shall submit to the Secretary, at a time determined by the Secretary, a performance and evaluation report concerning the use of funds made available under section 5306 of this title , together with an assessment by the grantee of the relationship of such use to the objectives identified in the grantee’s statement under subsection (a) and to the requirements of subsection (b)(3). Such report shall also be made available to the citizens in each grantee’s jurisdiction in sufficient time to permit such citizens to comment on such report prior to its submission, and in such manner and at such times as the grantee may determine. The grantee’s report shall indicate its programmatic accomplishments, the nature of and reasons for changes in the grantee’s program objectives, indications of how the grantee would change its programs as a result of its experiences, and an evaluation of the extent to which its funds were used for activities that benefited low- and moderate-income persons. The report shall include a summary of any comments received by the grantee from citizens in its jurisdiction respecting its program. The Secretary shall encourage and assist national associations of grantees eligible under section 5306(d)(2)(B) of this title , national associations of States, and national associations of units of general local government in nonentitlement areas to develop and recommend to the Secretary, within one year after November 30, 1983 , uniform recordkeeping, performance reporting, and evaluation reporting, and auditing requirements for such grantees, States, and units of general local government, respectively. Based on the Secretary’s approval of these recommendations, the Secretary shall establish such requirements for use by such grantees, States, and units of general local government. The Secretary shall, at least on an annual basis, make such reviews and audits as may be necessary or appropriate to determine

(1) in the case of grants made under subsection (a)(3), (b), or (d)(2)(B) of section 5306 of this title , whether the grantee has carried out its activities and, where applicable, its housing assistance plan in a timely manner, whether the grantee has carried out those activities and its certifications in accordance with the requirements and the primary objectives of this chapter and with other applicable laws, and whether the grantee has a continuing capacity to carry out those activities in a timely manner; and

(2) in the case of grants to States made under section 5306(d) of this title , whether the State has distributed funds to units of general local government in a timely manner and in conformance to the method of distribution described in its statement, whether the State has carried out its certifications in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws, and whether the State has made such reviews and audits of the units of general local government as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether they have satisfied the applicable performance criteria described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the amount of the annual grants in accordance with the Secretary’s findings under this subsection. With respect to assistance made available to units of general local government under section 5306(d) of this title , the Secretary may adjust, reduce, or withdraw such assistance, or take other action as appropriate in accordance with the Secretary’s reviews and audits under this subsection, except that funds already expended on eligible activities under this chapter shall not be recaptured or deducted from future assistance to such units of general local government.
