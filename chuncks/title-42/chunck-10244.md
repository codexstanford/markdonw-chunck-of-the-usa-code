### CHAPTER 16— NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
#### § 1862s–5. Programs to expand STEM opportunities
##### (e) Support for increasing diversity among STEM faculty at institutions of higher education

(1) In general

The Director of the Foundation shall make awards to institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof) for the development and assessment of innovative reform efforts designed to increase the recruitment, retention, and advancement of individuals from underrepresented minority groups in academic STEM careers, which may include implementing or expanding successful evidence-based practices.

(2) Merit review; competition

Awards shall be made under this subsection on a merit-reviewed, competitive basis.

(3) Use of funds

Activities supported by awards under this subsection may include

(A) institutional assessment activities, such as data analyses and policy review, in order to identify and address specific issues in the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups;

(B) assessments of distribution of mentoring and advising responsibilities among faculty, particularly for faculty from underrepresented minority groups, that may detract from time spent on research, publishing papers, and other activities required to achieve tenure status or promotion (or equivalents for non-tenure track faculty) and run a productive research program;

(C) development and assessment of training courses for administrators and search committee members designed to ensure unbiased evaluation of candidates from underrepresented minority groups;

(D) development and hosting of intra- or inter-institutional workshops to propagate best practices in recruiting, retaining, and advancing faculty members from underrepresented minority groups;

(E) professional development opportunities for faculty members from underrepresented minority groups;

(F) activities aimed at making undergraduate STEM students from underrepresented minority groups aware of opportunities for academic careers in STEM fields; and

(G) activities to identify and engage exceptional graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from underrepresented minority groups at various stages of their studies and to encourage them to enter academic careers.

(4) Selection process

(A) Application

An institution of higher education (or a consortium of such institutions) seeking funding under this subsection shall submit an application to the Director of the Foundation at such time, in such manner, and containing such information and assurances as such Director may require. The application shall include, at a minimum, a description of

(i) the reform effort that is being proposed for implementation by the institution of higher education;

(ii) any available evidence of specific difficulties in the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups in STEM academic careers within the institution of higher education submitting an application, and how the proposed reform effort would address such issues;

(iii) support for the proposed reform effort by administrators of the institution, which may include details on previous or ongoing reform efforts;

(iv) how the proposed reform effort may contribute to change in institutional culture and policy such that a greater value is placed on the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups;

(v) how the institution of higher education submitting an application plans to sustain the proposed reform effort beyond the duration of the award, if the effort proved successful; and

(vi) how the success and effectiveness of the proposed reform effort will be evaluated and assessed in order to contribute to the national knowledge base about models for catalyzing institutional change.

(B) Award distribution

The Director of the Foundation shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that awards under this section are made to a variety of types of institutions of higher education.

(5) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $8,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027.
