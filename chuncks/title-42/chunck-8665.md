### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396u–8. Health opportunity accounts
##### (a) Authority

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish a demonstration program under which States may provide under their State plans under this subchapter (including such a plan operating under a statewide waiver under section 1315 of this title ) in accordance with this section for the provision of alternative benefits consistent with subsection (c) for eligible population groups in one or more geographic areas of the State specified by the State. An amendment under the previous sentence is referred to in this section as a “State demonstration program”.

(2) Initial demonstration

(A) In general

The demonstration program under this section shall begin on January 1, 2007 . During the first 5 years of such program, the Secretary shall not approve more than 10 States to conduct demonstration programs under this section, with each State demonstration program covering 1 or more geographic areas specified by the State. After such 5-year period

(i) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that a State demonstration program previously implemented has been unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be extended or made permanent in the State; and

(ii) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that all State demonstration programs previously implemented were unsuccessful, other States may implement State demonstration programs.

(B) GAO report

(i) In general

Not later than 3 months after the end of the 5-year period described in subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress evaluating the demonstration programs conducted under this section during such period.

(ii) Appropriation

Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there is appropriated to the Comptroller General of the United States, $550,000 for the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2010 to carry out clause (i).

(3) Approval

The Secretary shall not approve a State demonstration program under paragraph (1) unless the program includes the following:

(A) Creating patient awareness of the high cost of medical care.

(B) Providing incentives to patients to seek preventive care services.

(C) Reducing inappropriate use of health care services.

(D) Enabling patients to take responsibility for health outcomes.

(E) Providing enrollment counselors and ongoing education activities.

(F) Providing transactions involving health opportunity accounts to be conducted electronically and without cash.

(G) Providing access to negotiated provider payment rates consistent with this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a State demonstration program from providing incentives for patients obtaining appropriate preventive care (as defined for purposes of section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), such as additional account contributions for an individual demonstrating healthy prevention practices.

(4) No requirement for statewideness

Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall be construed to require that a State must provide for the implementation of a State demonstration program on a Statewide  1 basis.
