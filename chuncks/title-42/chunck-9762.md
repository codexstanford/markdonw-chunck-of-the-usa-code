### CHAPTER 13— SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS
#### § 1761. Summer food service program for children
##### (e) Advance program payments to service institutions for monthly meal service; certification of personnel training sessions; minimum days per month operations requirement; payments: computation, limitation; valid claims, receipt; withholding; demand for repayment; subtraction of disputed payments

(1) Not later than June 1, July 15, and August 15 of each year, or, in the case of service institutions that operate under a continuous school calendar, the first day of each month of operation, the State shall forward advance program payments to each service institution. The State shall not release the second month’s advance program payment to any service institution (excluding a school) that has not certified that it has held training sessions for its own personnel and the site personnel with regard to program duties and responsibilities. No advance program payment may be made for any month in which the service institution will operate under the program for less than ten days.

(2) The amount of the advance program payment for any month in the case of any service institution shall be an amount equal to (A) the total program payment for meals served by such service institution in the same calendar month of the preceding calendar year, (B) 50 percent of the amount established by the State to be needed by such service institution for meals if such service institution contracts with a food service management company, or (C) 65 percent of the amount established by the State to be needed by such service institution for meals if such service institution prepares its own meals, whichever amount is greatest: Provided , That the advance program payment may not exceed the total amount estimated by the State to be needed by such service institution for meals to be served in the month for which such advance program payment is made or $40,000, whichever is less, except that a State may make a larger advance program payment to such service institution where the State determines that such larger payment is necessary for the operation of the program by such service institution and sufficient administrative and management capability to justify a larger payment is demonstrated. The State shall forward any remaining payment due a service institution not later than seventy-five days following receipt of valid claims. If the State has reason to believe that a service institution will not be able to submit a valid claim for reimbursement covering the period for which an advance program payment has been made, the subsequent month’s advance program payment shall be withheld until such time as the State has received a valid claim. Program payments advanced to service institutions that are not subsequently deducted from a valid claim for reimbursement shall be repaid upon demand by the State. Any prior payment that is under dispute may be subtracted from an advance program payment.
