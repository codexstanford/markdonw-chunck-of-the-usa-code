#### § 8279. National Action Plan for Demand Response
##### (a) National Assessment and report

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“Commission”) shall conduct a National Assessment of Demand Response. The Commission shall, within 18 months of December 19, 2007 , submit a report to Congress that includes each of the following:

(1) Estimation of nationwide demand response potential in 5 and 10 year horizons, including data on a State-by-State basis, and a methodology for updates of such estimates on an annual basis.

(2) Estimation of how much of this potential can be achieved within 5 and 10 years after December 19, 2007 , accompanied by specific policy recommendations that if implemented can achieve the estimated potential. Such recommendations shall include options for funding and/or incentives for the development of demand response resources.

(3) The Commission shall further note any barriers to demand response programs offering flexible, non-discriminatory, and fairly compensatory terms for the services and benefits made available, and shall provide recommendations for overcoming such barriers.

(4) The Commission shall seek to take advantage of preexisting research and ongoing work, and shall insure that there is no duplication of effort.
