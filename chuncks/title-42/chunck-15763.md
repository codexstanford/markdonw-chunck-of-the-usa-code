##### (a) Authority to transfer

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Energy may transfer, for consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the property referred to in subsection (b) to any person if the Secretary determines that such transfer will mitigate the adverse economic consequences that might otherwise arise from the closure of a Department of Energy facility.
