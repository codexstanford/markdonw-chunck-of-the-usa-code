#### § 8472. Effect of orders under section 792 of title 15
##### (b) Effect of prohibition orders

The provisions of subchapters II and III shall not apply to any powerplant or installation for which an order issued pursuant to section 792(a) of title 15 before the effective date of this chapter is pending or final or which, on review, was held unlawful and set aside on the merits; except that any installation issued such an order under such section 792(a) which is pending on the effective date of this chapter may elect to be covered by subchapter II or III (as the case may be) rather than such section 792. Such an election shall be irrevocable and shall be made in such form and manner as the Secretary shall, within 90 days after November 9, 1978 , prescribe. Such an election shall be made not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary prescribes the form and manner of making such election.
