Each agency carrying out a plan under subsection (c) for removal of public housing dwelling units from the inventory of the agency shall

(A) notify each family residing in a public housing project to be converted under the plan 90 days prior to the displacement date, except in cases of imminent threat to health or safety, consistent with any guidelines issued by the Secretary governing such notifications, that

(i) the public housing project will be removed from the inventory of the public housing agency; and

(ii) each family displaced by such action will be offered comparable housing

(I) that meets housing quality standards; and
