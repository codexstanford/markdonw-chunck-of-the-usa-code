(A) the Great Lakes region;

(B) the Pacific coast;

(C) the Atlantic coast;

(D) the Arctic;

(E) the Gulf coast; and

(F) the coasts of United States territories and freely associated States.

(6) Interoperability

(A) In general

The Director shall ensure that activities carried out under paragraphs (1) and (2), including observation, data collection, monitoring, and model development and enhancements, are interoperable and may be integrated with existing related systems at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other relevant Federal agencies, as practicable.

(B) Resources

In carrying out subparagraph (A), in support of interoperability, as practicable, the Director may make available to other Federal agencies high performance computing resources.
