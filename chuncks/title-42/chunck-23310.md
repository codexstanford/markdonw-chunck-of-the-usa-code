#### § 18645. Fusion energy
##### (e) Alternative and enabling concepts

(1) In general

The Director shall support research and development activities and facility operations at institutions of higher education, National Laboratories, and private facilities in the United States for a portfolio of alternative and enabling fusion energy concepts that may provide solutions to significant challenges to the establishment of a commercial magnetic fusion power plant, prioritized based on the ability of the United States to play a leadership role in the international fusion research community.

(2) Activities

Fusion energy concepts and activities explored under paragraph (1) may include

(A) alternative fusion energy concepts, including

(i) advanced stellarator concepts;

(ii) non-tokamak confinement configurations operating at low magnetic fields;

(iii) magnetized target fusion energy concepts; or

(iv) other promising fusion energy concepts identified by the Director;

(B) enabling fusion technology development activities, including

(i) high magnetic field approaches facilitated by high temperature superconductors;

(ii) liquid metals to address issues associated with fusion plasma interactions with the inner wall of the encasing device; and

(iii) advanced blankets for heat management and fuel breeding; and

(C) advanced scientific computing activities.

(3) Innovation network for fusion energy

(A) In general

The Secretary, acting through the Office of Science, shall support a program to provide fusion energy researchers with access to scientific and technical resources and expertise at facilities supported by the Department, including such facilities at National Laboratories and universities, to advance innovative fusion energy technologies toward commercial application.

(B) Awards

Financial assistance under the program established in subsection (a)

(i) shall be awarded on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis; and

(ii) may be in the form of grants, vouchers, equipment loans, or contracts to private entities.
