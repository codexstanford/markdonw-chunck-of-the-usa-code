#### § 1395l. Payment of benefits
##### (t) Prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services

(1) Amount of payment

(A) In general

With respect to covered OPD services (as defined in subparagraph (B)) furnished during a year beginning with 1999, the amount of payment under this part shall be determined under a prospective payment system established by the Secretary in accordance with this subsection.

(B) Definition of covered OPD services

For purposes of this subsection, the term “covered OPD services”

(i) means hospital outpatient services designated by the Secretary;

(ii) subject to clause (iv), includes inpatient hospital services designated by the Secretary that are covered under this part and furnished to a hospital inpatient who (I) is entitled to benefits under part A but has exhausted benefits for inpatient hospital services during a spell of illness, or (II) is not so entitled;

(iii) includes implantable items described in paragraph (3), (6), or (8) of section 1395x(s) of this title ;

(iv) does not include any therapy services described in subsection (a)(8) or ambulance services, for which payment is made under a fee schedule described in section 1395m(k) of this title or section 1395m( l ) of this title and does not include screening mammography (as defined in section 1395x(jj) of this title ), diagnostic mammography, or personalized prevention plan services (as defined in section 1395x(hhh)(1) of this title ); and

(v) does not include applicable items and services (as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (21)) that are furnished on or after January 1, 2017 , by an off-campus outpatient department of a provider (as defined in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph).

(2) System requirements

Under the payment system

(A) the Secretary shall develop a classification system for covered OPD services;

(B) the Secretary may establish groups of covered OPD services, within the classification system described in subparagraph (A), so that services classified within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources and so that an implantable item is classified to the group that includes the service to which the item relates;

(C) the Secretary shall, using data on claims from 1996 and using data from the most recent available cost reports, establish relative payment weights for covered OPD services (and any groups of such services described in subparagraph (B)) based on median (or, at the election of the Secretary, mean) hospital costs and shall determine projections of the frequency of utilization of each such service (or group of services) in 1999;

(D) subject to paragraph (19), the Secretary shall determine a wage adjustment factor to adjust the portion of payment and coinsurance attributable to labor-related costs for relative differences in labor and labor-related costs across geographic regions in a budget neutral manner;

(E) the Secretary shall establish, in a budget neutral manner, outlier adjustments under paragraph (5) and transitional pass-through payments under paragraph (6) and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments, such as adjustments for certain classes of hospitals;

(F) the Secretary shall develop a method for controlling unnecessary increases in the volume of covered OPD services;

(G) the Secretary shall create additional groups of covered OPD services that classify separately those procedures that utilize contrast agents from those that do not; and

(H) with respect to devices of brachytherapy consisting of a seed or seeds (or radioactive source), the Secretary shall create additional groups of covered OPD services that classify such devices separately from the other services (or group of services) paid for under this subsection in a manner reflecting the number, isotope, and radioactive intensity of such devices furnished, including separate groups for palladium-103 and iodine-125 devices and for stranded and non-stranded devices furnished on or after July 1, 2007 . For purposes of subparagraph (B), items and services within a group shall not be treated as “comparable with respect to the use of resources” if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary under subparagraph (C)) for an item or service within the group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if so elected) for an item or service within the group; except that the Secretary may make exceptions in unusual cases, such as low volume items and services, but may not make such an exception in the case of a drug or biological that has been designated as an orphan drug under section 360bb of title 21 .

(3) Calculation of base amounts

(A) Aggregate amounts that would be payable if deductibles were disregarded

The Secretary shall estimate the sum of

(i) the total amounts that would be payable from the Trust Fund under this part for covered OPD services in 1999, determined without regard to this subsection, as though the deductible under subsection (b) did not apply, and

(ii) the total amounts of copayments estimated to be paid under this subsection by beneficiaries to hospitals for covered OPD services in 1999, as though the deductible under subsection (b) did not apply.

(B) Unadjusted copayment amount

(i) In general

For purposes of this subsection, subject to clause (ii), the “unadjusted copayment amount” applicable to a covered OPD service (or group of such services) is 20 percent of the national median of the charges for the service (or services within the group) furnished during 1996, updated to 1999 using the Secretary’s estimate of charge growth during the period.

(ii) Adjusted to be 20 percent when fully phased in

If the pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year would be equal to or exceed 80 percent, then the unadjusted copayment amount shall be 20 percent of amount determined under subparagraph (D).

(iii) Rules for new services

The Secretary shall establish rules for establishment of an unadjusted copayment amount for a covered OPD service not furnished during 1996, based upon its classification within a group of such services.

(C) Calculation of conversion factors

(i) For 1999

(I) In general

The Secretary shall establish a 1999 conversion factor for determining the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in 1999. Such conversion factor shall be established on the basis of the weights and frequencies described in paragraph (2)(C) and in such a manner that the sum for all services and groups of the products (described in subclause (II) for each such service or group) equals the total projected amount described in subparagraph (A).

(II) Product described

The Secretary shall determine for each service or group the product of the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts (taking into account appropriate adjustments described in paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E)) and the estimated frequencies for such service or group.

(ii) Subsequent years

Subject to paragraph (8)(B), the Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for covered OPD services furnished in subsequent years in an amount equal to the conversion factor established under this subparagraph and applicable to such services furnished in the previous year increased by the OPD fee schedule increase factor specified under clause (iv) for the year involved.

(iii) Adjustment for service mix changes

Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments for service mix under paragraph (2) for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of covered OPD services that do not reflect real changes in service mix, the Secretary may adjust the conversion factor computed under this subparagraph for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

(iv) OPD fee schedule increase factor

For purposes of this subparagraph, subject to paragraph (17) and subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, the “OPD fee schedule increase factor” for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title to hospital discharges occurring during the fiscal year ending in such year, reduced by 1 percentage point for such factor for services furnished in each of 2000 and 2002. In applying the previous sentence for years beginning with 2000, the Secretary may substitute for the market basket percentage increase an annual percentage increase that is computed and applied with respect to covered OPD services furnished in a year in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase is determined and applied to inpatient hospital services for discharges occurring in a fiscal year.

(D) Calculation of medicare OPD fee schedule amounts

The Secretary shall compute a medicare OPD fee schedule amount for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, in an amount equal to the product of

(i) the conversion factor computed under subparagraph (C) for the year, and

(ii) the relative payment weight (determined under paragraph (2)(C)) for the service or group.

(E) Pre-deductible payment percentage

The pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year is equal to the ratio of

(i) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under subparagraph (D) for the year, minus the unadjusted copayment amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the service or group, to

(ii) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (D) for the year for such service or group.

(F) Productivity and other adjustment

After determining the OPD fee schedule increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor

(i) for 2012 and subsequent years, by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title ; and

(ii) for each of 2010 through 2019, by the adjustment described in subparagraph (G). The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the payment system under this subsection for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

(G) Other adjustment

For purposes of subparagraph (F)(ii), the adjustment described in this subparagraph is

(i) for each of 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point;

(ii) for each of 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point;

(iii) for 2014, 0.3 percentage point;

(iv) for each of 2015 and 2016, 0.2 percentage point; and

(v) for each of 2017, 2018, and 2019, 0.75 percentage point.

(4) Medicare payment amount

The amount of payment made from the Trust Fund under this part for a covered OPD service (and such services classified within a group) furnished in a year is determined, subject to paragraph (7), as follows:

(A) Fee schedule adjustments

The medicare OPD fee schedule amount (computed under paragraph (3)(D)) for the service or group and year is adjusted for relative differences in the cost of labor and other factors determined by the Secretary, as computed under paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E).

(B) Subtract applicable deductible

Reduce the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the amount of the deductible under subsection (b), to the extent applicable.

(C) Apply payment proportion to remainder

The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multiplied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C).

(5) Outlier adjustment

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for each covered OPD service (or group of services) for which a hospital’s charges, adjusted to cost, exceed

(i) a fixed multiple of the sum of

(I) the applicable medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under paragraph (3)(D), as adjusted under paragraph (4)(A) (other than for adjustments under this paragraph or paragraph (6)); and

(II) any transitional pass-through payment under paragraph (6); and

(ii) at the option of the Secretary, such fixed dollar amount as the Secretary may establish.

(B) Amount of adjustment

The amount of the additional payment under subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the applicable cutoff point under such subparagraph.

(C) Limit on aggregate outlier adjustments

(i) In general

The total of the additional payments made under this paragraph for covered OPD services furnished in a year (as estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the year) may not exceed the applicable percentage (specified in clause (ii)) of the total program payments estimated to be made under this subsection for all covered OPD services furnished in that year. If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year.

(ii) Applicable percentage

For purposes of clause (i), the term “applicable percentage” means a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed)

(I) for a year (or portion of a year) before 2004, 2.5 percent; and

(II) for 2004 and thereafter, 3.0 percent.

(D) Transitional authority

In applying subparagraph (A) for covered OPD services furnished before January 1, 2002 , the Secretary may

(i) apply such subparagraph to a bill for such services related to an outpatient encounter (rather than for a specific service or group of services) using OPD fee schedule amounts and transitional pass-through payments covered under the bill; and

(ii) use an appropriate cost-to-charge ratio for the hospital involved (as determined by the Secretary), rather than for specific departments within the hospital.

(E) Exclusion of separate drug and biological APCS from outlier payments

No additional payment shall be made under subparagraph (A) in the case of ambulatory payment classification groups established separately for drugs or biologicals.

(6) Transitional pass-through for additional costs of innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals

(A) In general

The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment under this paragraph for any of the following that are provided as part of a covered OPD service (or group of services):

(i) Current orphan drugs

A drug or biological that is used for a rare disease or condition with respect to which the drug or biological has been designated as an orphan drug under section 360bb of title 21 if payment for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on the first date that the system under this subsection is implemented.

(ii) Current cancer therapy drugs and biologicals and brachytherapy

A drug or biological that is used in cancer therapy, including (but not limited to) a chemotherapeutic agent, an antiemetic, a hematopoietic growth factor, a colony stimulating factor, a biological response modifier, a bisphosphonate, and a device of brachytherapy or temperature monitored cryoablation, if payment for such drug, biological, or device as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

(iii) Current radiopharmaceutical drugs and biological products

A radiopharmaceutical drug or biological product used in diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures if payment for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was being made on such first date.

(iv) New medical devices, drugs, and biologicals

A medical device, drug, or biological not described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) if

(I) payment for the device, drug, or biological as an outpatient hospital service under this part was not being made as of December 31, 1996 ; and

(II) the cost of the drug or biological or the average cost of the category of devices is not insignificant in relation to the OPD fee schedule amount (as calculated under paragraph (3)(D)) payable for the service (or group of services) involved.

(B) Use of categories in determining eligibility of a device for pass-through payments

The following provisions apply for purposes of determining whether a medical device qualifies for additional payments under clause (ii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A):

(i) Establishment of initial categories

(I) In general

The Secretary shall initially establish under this clause categories of medical devices based on type of device by April 1, 2001 . Such categories shall be established in a manner such that each medical device that meets the requirements of clause (ii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A) as of January 1, 2001 , is included in such a category and no such device is included in more than one category. For purposes of the preceding sentence, whether a medical device meets such requirements as of such date shall be determined on the basis of the program memoranda issued before such date.

(II) Authorization of implementation other than through regulations

The categories may be established under this clause by program memorandum or otherwise, after consultation with groups representing hospitals, manufacturers of medical devices, and other affected parties.

(ii) Establishing criteria for additional categories

The Secretary shall establish criteria that will be used for creation of additional categories (other than those established under clause (i)) through rulemaking (which may include use of an interim final rule with comment period).

(II) Standard

Such categories shall be established under this clause in a manner such that no medical device is described by more than one category. Such criteria shall include a test of whether the average cost of devices that would be included in a category and are in use at the time the category is established is not insignificant, as described in subparagraph (A)(iv)(II).

(III) Deadline

Criteria shall first be established under this clause by July 1, 2001 . The Secretary may establish in compelling circumstances categories under this clause before the date such criteria are established.

(IV) Adding categories

The Secretary shall promptly establish a new category of medical devices under this clause for any medical device that meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iv) and for which none of the categories in effect (or that were previously in effect) is appropriate.

(iii) Period for which category is in effect

A category of medical devices established under clause (i) or (ii) shall be in effect for a period of at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years, that begins

(I) the device is described by a category established and in effect under clause (i); or

(II) the device is described by a category established and in effect under clause (ii) and an application under section 360e of title 21 has been approved with respect to the device, or the device has been cleared for market under section 360(k) of title 21 , or the device is exempt from the requirements of section 360(k) of title 21 pursuant to subsection ( l ) or (m) of section 360 of title 21 or section 360j(g) of title 21 .  Nothing in this clause shall be construed as requiring an application or prior approval (other than that described in subclause (II)) in order for a covered device described by a category to qualify for payment under this paragraph.

(C) Limited period of payment

(i) Drugs and biologicals

Subject to subparagraph (G), the payment under this paragraph with respect to a drug or biological shall only apply during a period of at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years, that begins

(I) on the first date this subsection is implemented in the case of a drug or biological described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A) and in the case of a drug or biological described in subparagraph (A)(iv) and for which payment under this part is made as an outpatient hospital service before such first date; or

(II) in the case of a drug or biological described in subparagraph (A)(iv) not described in subclause (I), on the first date on which payment is made under this part for the drug or biological as an outpatient hospital service.

(ii) Medical devices

Payment shall be made under this paragraph with respect to a medical device only if such device

(I) is described by a category of medical devices established and in effect under subparagraph (B); and

(II) is provided as part of a service (or group of services) paid for under this subsection and provided during the period for which such category is in effect under such subparagraph.

(II) for 2004 and thereafter, a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed) 2.0 percent.

(iii) Uniform prospective reduction if aggregate limit projected to be exceeded

If the Secretary estimates before the beginning of a year that the amount of the additional payments under this paragraph for the year (or portion thereof) as determined under clause (i) without regard to this clause will exceed the limit established under such clause, the Secretary shall reduce pro rata the amount of each of the additional payments under this paragraph for that year (or portion thereof) in order to ensure that the aggregate additional payments under this paragraph (as so estimated) do not exceed such limit.

(F) Limitation of application of functional equivalence standard

(i) In general

The Secretary may not publish regulations that apply a functional equivalence standard to a drug or biological under this paragraph.

(ii) Application

Clause (i) shall apply to the application of a functional equivalence standard to a drug or biological on or after December 8, 2003 , unless

(I) such application was being made to such drug or biological prior to December 8, 2003 ; and

(II) the Secretary applies such standard to such drug or biological only for the purpose of determining eligibility of such drug or biological for additional payments under this paragraph and not for the purpose of any other payments under this subchapter.

(i) shall, as soon as practicable, conduct a review (part of which may include a request for information) of payments for opioids and evidence-based non-opioid alternatives for pain management (including drugs and devices, nerve blocks, surgical injections, and neuromodulation) with a goal of ensuring that there are not financial incentives to use opioids instead of non-opioid alternatives;

(ii) may, as the Secretary determines appropriate, conduct subsequent reviews of such payments; and

(iii) shall consider the extent to which revisions under this subsection to such payments (such as the creation of additional groups of covered OPD services to classify separately those procedures that utilize opioids and non-opioid alternatives for pain management) would reduce payment incentives to use opioids instead of non-opioid alternatives for pain management.

(B) Priority

In conducting the review under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) and considering revisions under clause (iii) of such subparagraph, the Secretary shall focus on covered OPD services (or groups of services) assigned to a comprehensive ambulatory payment classification, ambulatory payment classifications that primarily include surgical services, and other services determined by the Secretary which generally involve treatment for pain management.

(C) Revisions

If the Secretary identifies revisions to payments pursuant to subparagraph (A)(iii), the Secretary shall, as determined appropriate, begin making such revisions for services furnished on or after January 1, 2020 . Revisions under the previous sentence shall be treated as adjustments for purposes of application of paragraph (9)(B).

(D) Rules of construction

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to preclude the Secretary

(i) from conducting a demonstration before making the revisions described in subparagraph (C); or

(ii) prior to implementation of this paragraph, from changing payments under this subsection for covered OPD services (or groups of services) which include opioids or non-opioid alternatives for pain management.
