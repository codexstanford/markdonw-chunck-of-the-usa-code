#### § 12852. Assistance for first-time homebuyers
##### (b) Eligibility requirements

Assistance payments under this subchapter may be made only to homebuyers and for mortgages meeting the following requirements:

(1) First-time homebuyer

The homebuyer is an individual who

(A) (and whose spouse) has had no ownership in a principal residence during the 3-year period ending on the date of purchase of the property with respect to which assistance payments are made under this subchapter;

(B) is a displaced homemaker who, except for owning a home with his or her spouse or residing in a home owned by the spouse, meets the requirements of subparagraph (A);

(C) is a single parent who, except for owning a home with his or her spouse or residing in a home owned by the spouse while married, meets the requirements of subparagraph (A); or

(D) meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), except for owning, as a principal residence, a dwelling unit whose structure is

(i) not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation in accordance with local or other applicable regulations; or

(ii) not in compliance with State, local, or model building codes, or other applicable codes, and cannot be brought into compliance with such codes for less than the cost of constructing a permanent structure.

(2) Maximum income of homebuyer

The aggregate annual income of the homebuyer and the members of the family of the homebuyer residing with the homebuyer, for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application of the homebuyer for assistance under this subchapter, does not exceed

(A) 95 percent of the median income for a family of 4 persons (adjusted by family size) in the applicable metropolitan statistical area (or such other area that the Board of Directors determines for areas outside of metropolitan statistical areas); or

(B) 115 percent of such median income (adjusted by family size) in the case of an area that is subject to a high cost area mortgage limit under title II of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]. The Board of Directors shall provide for certification of such income for purposes of initial eligibility for assistance payments under this subchapter and shall provide for recertification of homebuyers (and families of homebuyers) so assisted not less than every 2 years thereafter.

(3) Certification

The homebuyer (and spouse, where applicable) shall certify that the homebuyer has made a good faith effort to obtain a market rate mortgage and has been denied because the annual income of the homebuyer and the members of the family of the homebuyer residing with the homebuyer is insufficient.

(4) Principal residence

The property securing the mortgage is a single-family residence or unit in a cooperative and is the principal residence of the homebuyer.

(5) Maximum mortgage amount

The principal obligation of the mortgage does not exceed the principal amount that could be insured with respect to the property under the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.].

(6) Maximum interest rate

The interest payable on the mortgage is established at a fixed rate that does not exceed a maximum rate of interest established by the Trust taking into consideration prevailing interest rates on similar mortgages.

(7) Responsible mortgagee

The mortgage has been made to, and is held by, a mortgagee that is federally insured or that is otherwise approved by the Trust as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly.

(8) Minimum downpayment

For a first-time homebuyer to receive downpayment assistance under subsection (a)(2), the homebuyer shall have paid not less than 1 percent of the cost of acquisition of the property (excluding any mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured), as such cost is estimated by the Board of Directors.
