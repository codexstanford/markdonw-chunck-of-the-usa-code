(A) In the case of the first fiscal year (or part of a fiscal year) for which this subsection applies to the State, the State’s regular FMAP shall be increased by 50 percent of the number of percentage points by which the State’s regular FMAP for such fiscal year is less than the Federal medical assistance percentage determined for the State for the preceding fiscal year after the application of only subsection (a) of section 5001 of Public Law 111–5 (if applicable to the preceding fiscal year) and without regard to this subsection, subsections (y) and (z), and subsections (b) and (c) of section 5001 of Public Law 111–5 .

(A) in the case of the first fiscal year (or part of a fiscal year) for which this subsection applies to the State, the State’s regular FMAP for the fiscal year is less than the Federal medical assistance percentage determined for the State for the preceding fiscal year after the application of only subsection (a) of section 5001 of Public Law 111–5 (if applicable to the preceding fiscal year) and without regard to this subsection, subsections (y) and (z), and subsections (b) and (c) of section 5001 of Public Law 111–5 , by at least 3 percentage points; and

(3) In this subsection, the term “regular FMAP” means, for each fiscal year for which this subsection applies to a State, the Federal medical assistance percentage that would otherwise apply to the State for the fiscal year, as determined under subsection (b) and without regard to this subsection, subsections (y) and (z), and section 10202 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
