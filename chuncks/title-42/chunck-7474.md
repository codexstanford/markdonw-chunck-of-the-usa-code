In developing and implementing the plan described in subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, include

(2) processes by which a physician or other eligible professional whose performance on measures is being publicly reported has a reasonable opportunity, as determined by the Secretary, to review his or her individual results before they are made public;

(3) processes by the Secretary to assure that the implementation of the plan and the data made available on Physician Compare provide a robust and accurate portrayal of a physician’s performance;

(4) data that reflects the care provided to all patients seen by physicians, under both the Medicare program and, to the extent practicable, other payers, to the extent such information would provide a more accurate portrayal of physician performance;

(5) processes to ensure appropriate attribution of care when multiple physicians and other providers are involved in the care of a patient;

(6) processes to ensure timely statistical performance feedback is provided to physicians concerning the data reported under any program subject to public reporting under this section; and
