#### § 291b. State allotments
##### (f) Request by State to transfer portion of allotment

In accordance with regulations, any State may file with the Surgeon General a request that a specified portion of an allotment to it under this part for grants for construction of any type of facility, or for modernization of facilities, be added to the corresponding allotment of another State for the purpose of meeting a portion of the Federal share of the cost of a project for the construction of a facility of that type in such other State, or for modernization of a facility in such other State, as the case may be. If it is found by the Surgeon General (or, in the case of a rehabilitation facility, by the Surgeon General and the Secretary) that construction or modernization of the facility with respect to which the request is made would meet needs of the State making the request and that use of the specified portion of such State’s allotment, as requested by it, would assist in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter, such portion of such State’s allotment shall be added to the corresponding allotment of the other State, to be used for the purpose referred to above.
