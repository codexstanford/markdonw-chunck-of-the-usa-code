Notwithstanding subsection (f) and subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), with respect to months beginning during fiscal year 2007, the Secretary shall provide for a redistribution under such subsection from the allotments for fiscal year 2004 under subsection (b) that are not expended by the end of fiscal year 2006, to a shortfall State described in subparagraph (B), such amount as the Secretary determines will eliminate the estimated shortfall described in such subparagraph for such State for the month.

(B) Shortfall State described

For purposes of this paragraph, a shortfall State described in this subparagraph is a State with a State child health plan approved under this subchapter for which the Secretary estimates, on a monthly basis using the most recent data available to the Secretary as of such month, that the projected expenditures under such plan for such State for fiscal year 2007 will exceed the sum of

If the amounts available for redistribution under subparagraph (A) for a month are less than the total amounts of the estimated shortfalls determined for the month under that subparagraph, the amount computed under such subparagraph for each shortfall State shall be reduced proportionally.
