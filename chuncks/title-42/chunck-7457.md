#### § 1395w–4. Payment for physicians’ services
##### (e) Geographic adjustment factors

(1) Establishment of geographic indices

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (E), (G), (H), and (I), the Secretary shall establish

(i) an index which reflects the relative costs of the mix of goods and services comprising practice expenses (other than malpractice expenses) in the different fee schedule areas compared to the national average of such costs,

(ii) an index which reflects the relative costs of malpractice expenses in the different fee schedule areas compared to the national average of such costs, and

(iii) an index which reflects ¼ of the difference between the relative value of physicians’ work effort in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such work effort.

(B) Class-specific geographic cost-of-practice indices

The Secretary may establish more than one index under subparagraph (A)(i) in the case of classes of physicians’ services, if, because of differences in the mix of goods and services comprising practice expenses for the different classes of services, the application of a single index under such clause to different classes of such services would be substantially inequitable.

(C) Periodic review and adjustments in geographic adjustment factors

The Secretary, not less often than every 3 years, shall, in consultation with appropriate representatives of physicians, review the indices established under subparagraph (A) and the geographic index values applied under this subsection for all fee schedule areas. Based on such review, the Secretary may revise such index and adjust such index values, except that, if more than 1 year has elasped  2 since the date of the last previous adjustment, the adjustment to be applied in the first year of the next adjustment shall be ½ of the adjustment that otherwise would be made.

(D) Use of recent data

In establishing indices and index values under this paragraph, the Secretary shall use the most recent data available relating to practice expenses, malpractice expenses, and physician work effort in different fee schedule areas.

(E) Floor at 1.0 on work geographic index

After calculating the work geographic index in subparagraph (A)(iii), for purposes of payment for services furnished on or after January 1, 2004 , and before January 1, 2024 , the Secretary shall increase the work geographic index to 1.00 for any locality for which such work geographic index is less than 1.00.

(G) 3 Floor for practice expense, malpractice, and work geographic indices for services furnished in Alaska

For purposes of payment for services furnished in Alaska on or after January 1, 2004 , and before January 1, 2006 , after calculating the practice expense, malpractice, and work geographic indices in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A) and in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall increase any such index to 1.67 if such index would otherwise be less than 1.67. For purposes of payment for services furnished in the State described in the preceding sentence on or after January 1, 2009 , after calculating the work geographic index in subparagraph (A)(iii), the Secretary shall increase the work geographic index to 1.5 if such index would otherwise be less than 1.5  1

(H) Practice expense geographic adjustment for 2010 and subsequent years

(i) For 2010

Subject to clause (iii), for services furnished during 2010, the employee wage and rent portions of the practice expense geographic index described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall reflect ½ of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such employee wages and rents.

(ii) For 2011

Subject to clause (iii), for services furnished during 2011, the employee wage and rent portions of the practice expense geographic index described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall reflect ½ of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such employee wages and rents.

(iii) Hold harmless

The practice expense portion of the geographic adjustment factor applied in a fee schedule area for services furnished in 2010 or 2011 shall not, as a result of the application of clause (i) or (ii), be reduced below the practice expense portion of the geographic adjustment factor under subparagraph (A)(i) (as calculated prior to the application of such clause (i) or (ii), respectively) for such area for such year.

(iv) Analysis

The Secretary shall analyze current methods of establishing practice expense geographic adjustments under subparagraph (A)(i) and evaluate data that fairly and reliably establishes distinctions in the costs of operating a medical practice in the different fee schedule areas. Such analysis shall include an evaluation of the following:

(I) The feasibility of using actual data or reliable survey data developed by medical organizations on the costs of operating a medical practice, including office rents and non-physician staff wages, in different fee schedule areas.

(II) The office expense portion of the practice expense geographic adjustment described in subparagraph (A)(i), including the extent to which types of office expenses are determined in local markets instead of national markets.

(III) The weights assigned to each of the categories within the practice expense geographic adjustment described in subparagraph (A)(i).

(v) Revision for 2012 and subsequent years

As a result of the analysis described in clause (iv), the Secretary shall, not later than January 1, 2012 , make appropriate adjustments to the practice expense geographic adjustment described in subparagraph (A)(i) to ensure accurate geographic adjustments across fee schedule areas, including

(I) basing the office rents component and its weight on office expenses that vary among fee schedule areas; and

(II) considering a representative range of professional and non-professional personnel employed in a medical office based on the use of the American Community Survey data or other reliable data for wage adjustments.  Such adjustments shall be made without regard to adjustments made pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) and shall be made in a budget neutral manner.

(I) Floor for practice expense index for services furnished in frontier States

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), for purposes of payment for services furnished in a frontier State (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(3)(E)(iii)(II) of this title ) on or after January 1, 2011 , after calculating the practice expense index in subparagraph (A)(i), the Secretary shall increase any such index to 1.00 if such index would otherwise be less that  4 1.00. The preceding sentence shall not be applied in a budget neutral manner.

(ii) Limitation

This subparagraph shall not apply to services furnished in a State that receives a non-labor related share adjustment under section 1395ww(d)(5)(H) of this title .

(2) Computation of geographic adjustment factor

For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C), for all physicians’ services for each fee schedule area the Secretary shall establish a geographic adjustment factor equal to the sum of the geographic cost-of-practice adjustment factor (specified in paragraph (3)), the geographic malpractice adjustment factor (specified in paragraph (4)), and the geographic physician work adjustment factor (specified in paragraph (5)) for the service and the area.

(3) Geographic cost-of-practice adjustment factor

For purposes of paragraph (2), the “geographic cost-of-practice adjustment factor”, for a service for a fee schedule area, is the product of

(A) the proportion of the total relative value for the service that reflects the relative value units for the practice expense component, and

(B) the geographic cost-of-practice index value for the area for the service, based on the index established under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (1)(B) (as the case may be).

(4) Geographic malpractice adjustment factor

For purposes of paragraph (2), the “geographic malpractice adjustment factor”, for a service for a fee schedule area, is the product of

(A) the proportion of the total relative value for the service that reflects the relative value units for the malpractice component, and

(B) the geographic malpractice index value for the area, based on the index established under paragraph (1)(A)(ii).

(5) Geographic physician work adjustment factor

For purposes of paragraph (2), the “geographic physician work adjustment factor”, for a service for a fee schedule area, is the product of

(A) the proportion of the total relative value for the service that reflects the relative value units for the work component, and

(B) the geographic physician work index value for the area, based on the index established under paragraph (1)(A)(iii).

(6) Use of MSAs as fee schedule areas in California

(A) In general

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this paragraph and notwithstanding the previous provisions of this subsection, for services furnished on or after January 1, 2017 , the fee schedule areas used for payment under this section applicable to California shall be the following:

(i) Each Metropolitan Statistical Area (each in this paragraph referred to as an “MSA”), as defined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as of December 31 of the previous year, shall be a fee schedule area.

(ii) All areas not included in an MSA shall be treated as a single rest-of-State fee schedule area.

(B) Transition for MSAs previously in rest-of-state payment locality or in locality 3

(i) In general

For services furnished in California during a year beginning with 2017 and ending with 2021 in an MSA in a transition area (as defined in subparagraph (D)), subject to subparagraph (C), the geographic index values to be applied under this subsection for such year shall be equal to the sum of the following:

(I) Current law component

The old weighting factor (described in clause (ii)) for such year multiplied by the geographic index values under this subsection for the fee schedule area that included such MSA that would have applied in such area (as estimated by the Secretary) if this paragraph did not apply.

(II) MSA-based component

The MSA-based weighting factor (described in clause (iii)) for such year multiplied by the geographic index values computed for the fee schedule area under subparagraph (A) for the year (determined without regard to this subparagraph).

(ii) Old weighting factor

The old weighting factor described in this clause

(I) for 2017, is ⅚; and

(II) for each succeeding year, is the old weighting factor described in this clause for the previous year minus ⅙.

(iii) MSA-based weighting factor

The MSA-based weighting factor described in this clause for a year is 1 minus the old weighting factor under clause (ii) for that year.

(C) Hold harmless

For services furnished in a transition area in California during a year beginning with 2017, the geographic index values to be applied under this subsection for such year shall not be less than the corresponding geographic index values that would have applied in such transition area (as estimated by the Secretary) if this paragraph did not apply.

(D) Transition area defined

In this paragraph, the term “transition area” means each of the following fee schedule areas for 2013:

(i) The rest-of-State payment locality.

(ii) Payment locality 3.

(E) References to fee schedule areas

Effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2017 , for California, any reference in this section to a fee schedule area shall be deemed a reference to a fee schedule area established in accordance with this paragraph.
