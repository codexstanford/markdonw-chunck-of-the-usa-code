### CHAPTER 101— MAGNETIC FUSION ENERGY ENGINEERING
#### § 9301. Congressional findings and declaration of policy
###### (b) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the United States and the purpose of this chapter to accelerate the national effort in research, development, and demonstration activities related to magnetic fusion energy systems. Further, it is declared to be the policy of the United States and the purpose of this chapter that the objectives of such program shall be

(1) to promote an orderly transition from the current research and development program through commercial development;

(2) to establish a national goal of demonstrating the engineering feasibility of magnetic fusion by the early 1990’s;

(3) to achieve at the earliest practicable time, but not later than the year 1990, operation of a magnetic fusion engineering device based on the best available confinement concept;

(4) to establish as a national goal the operation of a magnetic fusion demonstration plant at the turn of the twenty-first century;

(5) to foster cooperation in magnetic fusion research and development among government, universities, industry, and national laboratories;

(6) to promote the broad participation of domestic industry in the national magnetic fusion program;

(7) to continue international cooperation in magnetic fusion research for the benefit of all nations;

(8) to promote greater public understanding of magnetic fusion; and

(9) to maintain the United States as the world leader in magnetic fusion.
