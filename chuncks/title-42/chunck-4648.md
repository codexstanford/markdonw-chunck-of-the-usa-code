(D) Increased adjustment for certain areas previously using code-based reporting

For purposes of this subsection for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the Secretary shall deem the applicable number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in an area that were reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be 3 percent higher than the actual number if the conditions described in items (aa) through (cc) of subsection (a)(3)(C)(vi)(III) are all satisfied.
