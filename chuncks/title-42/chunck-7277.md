### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395m. Special payment rules for particular items and services
##### (b) Fee schedules for radiologist services

(1) Development

The Secretary shall develop

(A) a relative value scale to serve as the basis for the payment for radiologist services under this part, and

(B) using such scale and appropriate conversion factors and subject to subsection (c)(1)(A), fee schedules (on a regional, statewide, locality, or carrier service area basis) for payment for radiologist services under this part, to be implemented for such services furnished during 1989.

(2) Consultation

In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall regularly consult closely with the Physician Payment Review Commission, the American College of Radiology, and other organizations representing physicians or suppliers who furnish radiologist services and shall share with them the data and data analysis being used to make the determinations under paragraph (1), including data on variations in current medicare payments by geographic area, and by service and physician specialty.

(3) Considerations

In developing the relative value scale and fee schedules under paragraph (1), the Secretary

(A) shall take into consideration variations in the cost of furnishing such services among geographic areas and among different sites where services are furnished, and

(B) may also take into consideration such other factors respecting the manner in which physicians in different specialties furnish such services as may be appropriate to assure that payment amounts are equitable and designed to promote effective and efficient provision of radiologist services by physicians in the different specialties.

(4) Savings

(A) Budget neutral fee schedules

The Secretary shall develop preliminary fee schedules for 1989, which are designed to result in the same amount of aggregate payments (net of any coinsurance and deductibles under sections 1395 l (a)(1)(J) and 1395 l (b) of this title) for radiologist services furnished in 1989 as would have been made if this subsection had not been enacted.

(B) Initial savings

The fee schedules established for payment purposes under this subsection for services furnished in 1989 shall be 97 percent of the amounts permitted under the preliminary fee schedules developed under subparagraph (A).

(C) 1990 fee schedules

For radiologist services (other than portable X-ray services) furnished under this part during 1990, after March 31 of such year, the conversion factors used under this subsection shall be 96 percent of the conversion factors that applied under this subsection as of December 31, 1989 .

(D) 1991 fee schedules

For radiologist services (other than portable X-ray services) furnished under this part during 1991, the conversion factors used in a locality under this subsection shall, subject to clause (vii), be reduced to the adjusted conversion factor for the locality determined as follows:

(i) National weighted average conversion factor

The Secretary shall estimate the national weighted average of the conversion factors used under this subsection for services furnished during 1990 beginning on April 1, using the best available data.

(ii) Reduced national weighted average

The national weighted average estimated under clause (i) shall be reduced by 13 percent.

(iii) Computation of 1990 locality index relative to national average

The Secretary shall establish an index which reflects, for each locality, the ratio of the conversion factor used in the locality under this subsection to the national weighted average estimated under clause (i).

(iv) Adjusted conversion factor

The adjusted conversion factor for the professional or technical component of a service in a locality is the sum of ½ of the locally-adjusted amount determined under clause (v) and ½ of the GPCI-adjusted amount determined under clause (vi).

(v) Locally-adjusted amount

For purposes of clause (iv), the locally adjusted amount determined under this clause is the product of (I) the national weighted average conversion factor computed under clause (ii), and (II) the index value established under clause (iii) for the locality.

(vi) GPCI-adjusted amount

For purposes of clause (iv), the GPCI-adjusted amount determined under this clause is the sum of

(I) the product of (a) the portion of the reduced national weighted average conversion factor computed under clause (ii) which is attributable to physician work and (b) the geographic work index value for the locality (specified in Addendum C to the Model Fee Schedule for Physician Services (published on September 4, 1990 , 55 Federal Register pp. 36238–36243)); and

(II) the product of (a) the remaining portion of the reduced national weighted average conversion factor computed under clause (ii), and (b) the geographic practice cost index value specified in section 1395u(b)(14)(C)(iv) of this title for the locality.  In applying this clause with respect to the professional component of a service, 80 percent of the conversion factor shall be considered to be attributable to physician work and with respect to the technical component of the service, 0 percent shall be considered to be attributable to physician work.

(vii) Limits on conversion factor

The conversion factor to be applied to a locality to the professional or technical component of a service shall not be reduced under this subparagraph by more than 9.5 percent below the conversion factor applied in the locality under subparagraph (C) to such component, but in no case shall the conversion factor be less than 60 percent of the national weighted average of the conversion factors (computed under clause (i)).

(E) Rule for certain scanning services

In the case of the technical components of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services and computer assisted tomography (CAT) services furnished after December 31, 1990 , the amount otherwise payable shall be reduced by 10 percent.

(F) Subsequent updating

For radiologist services furnished in subsequent years, the fee schedules shall be the schedules for the previous year updated by the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title ) for the year.

(G) Nonparticipating physicians and suppliers

Each fee schedule so established shall provide that the payment rate recognized for nonparticipating physicians and suppliers is equal to the appropriate percent (as defined in section 1395u(b)(4)(A)(iv) of this title ) of the payment rate recognized for participating physicians and suppliers.

(5) Limiting charges of nonparticipating physicians and suppliers

(A) In general

In the case of radiologist services furnished after January 1, 1989 , for which payment is made under a fee schedule under this subsection, if a nonparticipating physician or supplier furnishes the service to an individual entitled to benefits under this part, the physician or supplier may not charge the individual more than the limiting charge (as defined in subparagraph (B)).

(B) “Limiting charge” defined

In subparagraph (A), the term “limiting charge” means, with respect to a service furnished

(i) in 1989, 125 percent of the amount specified for the service in the appropriate fee schedule established under paragraph (1),

(ii) in 1990, 120 percent of the amount specified for the service in the appropriate fee schedule established under paragraph (1), and

(iii) after 1990, 115 percent of the amount specified for the service in the appropriate fee schedule established under paragraph (1).

(C) Enforcement

If a physician or supplier knowingly and willfully bills in violation of subparagraph (A), the Secretary may apply sanctions against such physician or supplier in accordance with section 1395u(j)(2) of this title in the same manner as such sanctions may apply to a physician.

(6) “Radiologist services” defined

For the purposes of this subsection and section 1395 l (a)(1)(J) of this title, the term “radiologist services” only includes radiology services performed by, or under the direction or supervision of, a physician

(A) who is certified, or eligible to be certified, by the American Board of Radiology, or

(B) for whom radiology services account for at least 50 percent of the total amount of charges made under this part.
