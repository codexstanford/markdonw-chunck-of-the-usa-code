### CHAPTER 163— RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COMPETITION, AND INNOVATION
#### § 19222. National research and development strategy for distributed ledger technology
##### (b) National distributed ledger technology research and development strategy

(1) In general

The Director, or a designee of the Director, shall, in coordination with the National Science and Technology Council, and the heads of such other relevant Federal agencies and entities as the Director considers appropriate, which may include the National Academies, and in consultation with such nongovernmental entities as the Director considers appropriate, develop a national strategy for the research and development of distributed ledger technologies and their applications, including applications of public and permissionless distributed ledgers. In developing the national strategy, the Director shall consider the following:

(A) Current efforts and coordination by Federal agencies to invest in the research and development of distributed ledger technologies and their applications, including through programs like the Small Business Innovation Research program, the Small Business Technology Transfer program, and the National Science Foundation’s Innovation Corps programs.

(B)

(i) The potential benefits and risks of applications of distributed ledger technologies across different industry sectors, including their potential to

(I) lower transactions costs and facilitate new types of commercial transactions;

(II) protect privacy and increase individuals’ data sovereignty;

(III) reduce friction to the interoperability of digital systems;

(IV) increase the accessibility, auditability, security, efficiency, and transparency of digital services;

(V) increase market competition in the provision of digital services;

(VI) enable dynamic contracting and contract execution through smart contracts;

(VII) enable participants to collaborate in trustless and disintermediated environments;

(VIII) enable the operations and governance of distributed organizations;

(IX) create new ownership models for digital items; and

(X) increase participation of populations historically underrepresented in the technology, business, and financial sectors.

(ii) In consideration of the potential risks of applications of distributed ledger technologies under clause (i), the Director shall take into account, where applicable

(I) additional risks that may emerge from distributed ledger technologies, as identified in reports submitted to the President pursuant to Executive Order 14067, that may be addressed by research and development;

(II) software vulnerabilities in distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts;

(III) limited consumer literacy on engaging with applications of distributed ledger technologies in a secure way;

(IV) the use of distributed ledger technologies in illicit finance and their use in combating illicit finance;

(V) manipulative, deceptive, and fraudulent practices that harm consumers engaging with applications of distributed ledger technologies;

(VI) the implications of different consensus mechanisms for digital ledgers and governance and accountability mechanisms for applications of distributed ledger technologies, which may include decentralized networks;

(VII) foreign activities in the development and deployment of distributed ledger technologies and their associated tools and infrastructure; and

(VIII) environmental, sustainability, and economic impacts of the computational resources required for distributed ledger technologies.

(C) Potential uses for distributed ledger technologies that could improve the operations and delivery of services by Federal agencies, taking into account the potential of digital ledger technologies to

(i) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of privacy-preserving data sharing among Federal agencies and with State, local, territorial, and Tribal governments;

(ii) promote government transparency by improving data sharing with the public;

(iii) introduce or mitigate risks that may threaten individuals’ rights or broad access to Federal services;

(iv) automate and modernize processes for assessing and ensuring regulatory compliance; and

(v) facilitate broad access to financial services for underserved and underbanked populations.

(D) Ways to support public and private sector dialogue on areas of research that could enhance the efficiency, scalability, interoperability, security, and privacy of applications using distributed ledger technologies.

(E) The need for increased coordination of the public and private sectors on the development of voluntary standards in order to promote research and development, including standards regarding security, smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, virtual routing and forwarding, interoperability, zero-knowledge proofs, and privacy, for distributed ledger technologies and their applications.

(F) Applications of distributed ledger technologies that could positively benefit society but that receive relatively little private sector investment.

(G) The United States position in global leadership and competitiveness across research, development, and deployment of distributed ledger technologies.

(2) Consultation

(A) In general

In carrying out the Director’s duties under this subsection, the Director shall consult with the following:

(i) Private industry.

(ii) Institutions of higher education, including minority-serving institutions.

(iii) Nonprofit organizations, including foundations dedicated to supporting distributed ledger technologies and their applications.

(iv) State governments.

(v) Such other persons as the Director considers appropriate.

(B) Representation

The Director shall ensure consultations with the following:

(i) Rural and urban stakeholders from across the Nation.

(ii) Small, medium, and large businesses.

(iii) Subject matter experts representing multiple industrial sectors.

(iv) A demographically diverse set of stakeholders.

(3) Coordination

In carrying out this subsection, the Director shall, for purposes of avoiding duplication of activities, consult, cooperate, and coordinate with the programs and policies of other relevant Federal agencies, including the interagency process outlined in section 3 of Executive Order 14067 (87 Fed. Reg. 14143; relating ensuring responsible development of digital assets).

(4) National strategy

Not later than 1 year after December 23, 2022 , the Director shall submit to the relevant congressional committees and the President a national strategy that includes the following:

(A) Priorities for the research and development of distributed ledger technologies and their applications.

(B) Plans to support public and private sector investment and partnerships in research and technology development for societally beneficial applications of distributed ledger technologies.

(C) Plans to mitigate the risks of distributed ledger technologies and their applications.

(D) An identification of additional resources, administrative action, or legislative action recommended to assist with the implementation of such strategy.

(5) Research and development funding

The Director shall, as the Director considers necessary, consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and with the heads of such other elements of the Executive Office of the President as the Director considers appropriate, to ensure that the recommendations and priorities with respect to research and development funding, as expressed in the national strategy developed under this subsection, are incorporated in the development of annual budget requests for Federal research agencies.
