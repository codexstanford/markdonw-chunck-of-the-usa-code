#### § 263b. Certification of mammography facilities
##### (c) Issuance and renewal of certificates

(1) In general

The Secretary may issue or renew a certificate for a facility if the person or agent described in subsection (d)(1)(A) meets the applicable requirements of subsection (d)(1) with respect to the facility. The Secretary may issue or renew a certificate under this paragraph for not more than 3 years.

(2) Temporary renewal certificate

The Secretary may issue a temporary renewal certificate, for a period of not to exceed 45 days, to a facility seeking reaccreditation if the accreditation body has issued an accreditation extension, for a period of not to exceed 45 days, for any of the following:

(A) The facility has submitted the required materials to the accreditation body within the established time frames for the submission of such materials but the accreditation body is unable to complete the reaccreditation process before the certification expires.

(B) The facility has acquired additional or replacement equipment, or has had significant personnel changes or other unforeseen situations that have caused the facility to be unable to meet reaccreditation timeframes, but in the opinion of the accreditation body have not compromised the quality of mammography.

(3) Limited provisional certificate

The Secretary may, upon the request of an accreditation body, issue a limited provisional certificate to an entity to enable the entity to conduct examinations for educational purposes while an onsite visit from an accreditation body is in progress. Such certificate shall be valid only during the time the site visit team from the accreditation body is physically in the facility, and in no case shall be valid for longer than 72 hours. The issuance of a certificate under this paragraph, shall not preclude the entity from qualifying for a provisional certificate under paragraph (4).

(4) Provisional certificate

The Secretary may issue a provisional certificate for an entity to enable the entity to qualify as a facility. The applicant for a provisional certificate shall meet the requirements of subsection (d)(1), except providing information required by clauses (iii) and (iv) of subsection (d)(1)(A). A provisional certificate may be in effect no longer than 6 months from the date it is issued, except that it may be extended once for a period of not more than 90 days if the owner, lessor, or agent of the facility demonstrates to the Secretary that without such extension access to mammography in the geographic area served by the facility would be significantly reduced and if the owner, lessor, or agent of the facility will describe in a report to the Secretary steps that will be taken to qualify the facility for certification under subsection (b)(1).
