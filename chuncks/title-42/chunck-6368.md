(B) The amount of funds transferred to the account of a State under subparagraph (A) during the applicable period shall, as determined by the Secretary of Labor and except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, be equal to one-half of the amounts of compensation (as defined in section 3306(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) attributable under the State law to service to which section 3309(a) of such Code applies and to service provided by employees of an entity created by Public Law 85–874 ( 20 U.S.C. 76h et seq.) that were paid by the State for weeks of unemployment beginning and ending during such period. With respect to the amounts of such compensation paid for weeks of unemployment beginning after March 31, 2021 , and ending on or before September 6, 2021 , the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting “75 percent” for “one-half”. Such transfers shall be made at such times as the Secretary of Labor considers appropriate.

(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds transferred to the account of a State under subparagraph (A) shall be used exclusively to reduce the amounts required to be paid in lieu of contributions into the State unemployment fund pursuant to such section by governmental entities and other organizations described in section 3309(a) of such Code or an entity created by Public Law 85–874 ( 20 U.S.C. 76h et seq.).

(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “applicable period” means the period beginning on March 13, 2020 , and ending on September 6, 2021 .
