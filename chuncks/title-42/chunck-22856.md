#### § 17386. Federal matching fund for smart grid investment costs
##### (b) Qualifying investments

Qualifying Smart Grid investments may include any of the following made on or after November 15, 2021 :

(1) In the case of appliances covered for purposes of establishing energy conservation standards under part B of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 ( 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq.), the documented expenditures incurred by a manufacturer of such appliances associated with purchasing or designing, creating the ability to manufacture, and manufacturing and installing for one calendar year, internal devices that allow the appliance to engage in Smart Grid functions.

(2) In the case of specialized electricity-using equipment, including motors and drivers, installed in industrial or commercial applications, the documented expenditures incurred by its owner or its manufacturer of installing devices or modifying that equipment to engage in Smart Grid functions.

(3) In the case of transmission and distribution equipment fitted with monitoring and communications devices to enable smart grid functions, the documented expenditures incurred by the electric utility to purchase and install such monitoring and communications devices.

(4) In the case of metering devices, sensors, control devices, and other devices integrated with and attached to an electric utility system or retail distributor or marketer of electricity that are capable of engaging in Smart Grid functions, the documented expenditures incurred by the electric utility, distributor, or marketer and its customers to purchase and install such devices.

(5) In the case of software that enables devices or computers to engage in Smart Grid functions, the documented purchase costs of the software.

(6) In the case of entities that operate or coordinate operations of regional electric grids, the documented expenditures for purchasing and installing such equipment that allows Smart Grid functions to operate and be combined or coordinated among multiple electric utilities and between that region and other regions.

(7) In the case of persons or entities other than electric utilities owning and operating a distributed electricity generator, the documented expenditures of enabling that generator to be monitored, controlled, or otherwise integrated into grid operations and electricity flows on the grid utilizing Smart Grid functions.

(8) In the case of electric or hybrid-electric vehicles, the documented expenses for devices that allow the vehicle to engage in Smart Grid functions (but not the costs of electricity storage for the vehicle).

(9) In the case of data analytics that enable software to engage in Smart Grid functions, the documented purchase costs of the data analytics.

(10) In the case of buildings, the documented expenses for devices and software, including for installation, that allow buildings to engage in demand flexibility or Smart Grid functions.

(11) In the case of utility communications, operational fiber and wireless broadband communications networks to enable data flow between distribution system components.

(12) In the case of advanced transmission technologies such as dynamic line rating, flow control devices, advanced conductors, network topology optimization, or other hardware, software, and associated protocols applied to existing transmission facilities that increase the operational transfer capacity of a transmission network, the documented expenditures to purchase and install those advanced transmission technologies.

(13) In the case of extreme weather or natural disasters, the ability to redirect or shut off power to minimize blackouts and avoid further damage.

(14) The documented expenditures related to purchasing and implementing Smart Grid functions in such other cases as the Secretary shall identify.
