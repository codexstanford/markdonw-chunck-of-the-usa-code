##### (c) Health research or teaching; service period; recovery upon noncompliance with service requirement, formula; cancellation or waiver of obligation

(1) Each individual who is awarded a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award for postdoctoral research training shall, in accordance with paragraph (3), engage in research training, research, or teaching that is health-related (or any combination thereof) for the period specified in paragraph (2). Such period shall be served in accordance with the usual patterns of scientific employment.

(2)

(A) The period referred to in paragraph (1) is 12 months, or one month for each month for which the individual involved receives a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award for postdoctoral research training, whichever is less.

(B) With respect to postdoctoral research training, in any case in which an individual receives a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award for more than 12 months, the 13th month and each subsequent month of performing activities under the Award shall be considered to be activities engaged in toward satisfaction of the requirement established in paragraph (1) regarding a period of service.

(3) The requirement of paragraph (1) shall be complied with by any individual to whom it applies within such reasonable period of time, after the completion of such individual’s award, as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe. The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the type of research and teaching in which an individual may engage to comply with such requirement and such other requirements respecting research and teaching as the Secretary considers appropriate.

(4)

(A) If any individual to whom the requirement of paragraph (1) is applicable fails, within the period prescribed by paragraph (3), to comply with such requirements, the United States shall be entitled to recover from such individual an amount determined in accordance with the formula—      t−s   A=ϕ   A —— B     t   in which “A” is the amount the United States is entitled to recover; “ϕ” is the sum of the total amount paid under one or more Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards to such individual; “t” is the total number of months in such individual’s service obligation; and “s” is the number of months of such obligation served by such individual in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.

(B) Any amount which the United States is entitled to recover under subparagraph (A) shall, within the three-year period beginning on the date the United States becomes entitled to recover such amount, be paid to the United States. Until any amount due the United States under subparagraph (A) on account of any Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award is paid, there shall accrue to the United States interest on such amount at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into consideration private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the date the United States becomes entitled to such amount.

(5)

(A) Any obligation of an individual under paragraph (1) shall be canceled upon the death of such individual.

(B) The Secretary shall by regulation provide for the waiver or suspension of any such obligation applicable to any individual whenever compliance by such individual is impossible or would involve substantial hardship to such individual or would be against equity and good conscience.
