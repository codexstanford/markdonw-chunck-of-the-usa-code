### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–23. Payments to Medicare+Choice organizations
##### (m) Application of eligible hospital incentives for certain MA organizations for adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology

(1) Application

Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), in the case of a qualifying MA organization, the provisions of sections 1395ww(n) and 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(ix) of this title shall apply with respect to eligible hospitals described in paragraph (2) of the organization which the organization attests under subsection ( l )(6) to be meaningful EHR users in a similar manner as they apply to eligible hospitals under such sections. Incentive payments under paragraph (3) shall be made to and payment adjustments under paragraph (4) shall apply to such qualifying organizations.

(2) Eligible hospital described

With respect to a qualifying MA organization, an eligible hospital described in this paragraph is an eligible hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(n)(6)(B) of this title ) that is under common corporate governance with such organization and serves individuals enrolled under an MA plan offered by such organization.

(3) Eligible hospital incentive payments

(A) In general

In applying section 1395ww(n)(2) of this title under paragraph (1), instead of the additional payment amount under section 1395ww(n)(2) of this title , there shall be substituted an amount determined by the Secretary to be similar to the estimated amount in the aggregate that would be payable if payment for services furnished by such hospitals was payable under part A instead of this part. In implementing the previous sentence, the Secretary

(i) shall, insofar as data to determine the discharge related amount under section 1395ww(n)(2)(C) of this title for an eligible hospital are not available to the Secretary, use such alternative data and methodology to estimate such discharge related amount as the Secretary determines appropriate; and

(ii) shall, insofar as data to determine the medicare share described in section 1395ww(n)(2)(D) of this title for an eligible hospital are not available to the Secretary, use such alternative data and methodology to estimate such share, which data and methodology may include use of the inpatient-bed-days (or discharges) with respect to an eligible hospital during the appropriate period which are attributable to both individuals for whom payment may be made under part A or individuals enrolled in an MA plan under a Medicare Advantage organization under this part as a proportion of the estimated total number of patient-bed-days (or discharges) with respect to such hospital during such period.

(B) Avoiding duplication of payments

(i) In general

In the case of a hospital that for a payment year is an eligible hospital described in paragraph (2) and for which at least one-third of their discharges (or bed-days) of Medicare patients for the year are covered under part A, payment for the payment year shall be made only under section 1395ww(n) of this title and not under this subsection.

(ii) Methods

In the case of a hospital that is an eligible hospital described in paragraph (2) and also is eligible for an incentive payment under section 1395ww(n) of this title but is not described in clause (i) for the same payment period, the Secretary shall develop a process

(I) to ensure that duplicate payments are not made with respect to an eligible hospital both under this subsection and under section 1395ww(n) of this title ; and

(II) to collect data from Medicare Advantage organizations to ensure against such duplicate payments.

(4) Payment adjustment

(A) Subject to paragraph (3), in the case of a qualifying MA organization (as defined in subsection ( l )(5)), if, according to the attestation of the organization submitted under subsection ( l )(6) for an applicable period, one or more eligible hospitals (as defined in section 1395ww(n)(6)(B) of this title ) that are under common corporate governance with such organization and that serve individuals enrolled under a plan offered by such organization are not meaningful EHR users (as defined in section 1395ww(n)(3) of this title ) with respect to a period, the payment amount payable under this section for such organization for such period shall be the percent specified in subparagraph (B) for such period of the payment amount otherwise provided under this section for such period.

(B) Specified percent .

The percent specified under this subparagraph for a year is 100 percent minus a number of percentage points equal to the product of

(i) the number of the percentage point reduction effected under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of this title for the period; and

(ii) the Medicare hospital expenditure proportion specified in subparagraph (C) for the year.

(C) Medicare hospital expenditure proportion .

The Medicare hospital expenditure proportion under this subparagraph for a year is the Secretary’s estimate of the proportion, of the expenditures under parts A and B that are not attributable to this part, that are attributable to expenditures for inpatient hospital services.

(D) Application of payment adjustment .

In the case that a qualifying MA organization attests that not all eligible hospitals are meaningful EHR users with respect to an applicable period, the Secretary shall apply the payment adjustment under this paragraph based on a methodology specified by the Secretary, taking into account the proportion of such eligible hospitals, or discharges from such hospitals, that are not meaningful EHR users for such period.

(5) Posting on website

The Secretary shall post on the Internet website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in an easily understandable format

(A) a list of the names, business addresses, and business phone numbers of each qualifying MA organization receiving an incentive payment under this subsection for eligible hospitals described in paragraph (2); and

(B) a list of the names of the eligible hospitals for which such incentive payment is based.

(6) Limitations on review

There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title , section 1395 oo of this title, or otherwise, of

(A) the methodology and standards for determining payment amounts and payment adjustments under this subsection, including avoiding duplication of payments under paragraph (3)(B);

(B) the methodology and standards for determining eligible hospitals under paragraph (2); and

(C) the methodology and standards for determining a meaningful EHR user under section 1395ww(n)(3) of this title , including specification of the means of demonstrating meaningful EHR use under subparagraph (C) of such section and selection of measures under subparagraph (B) of such section.
