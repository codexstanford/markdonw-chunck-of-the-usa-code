#### § 4743. Grants to State and local governments for training
##### (b) Application; time of making; information; terms and conditions; waiver; development costs

An application for a grant from a State or general local government shall be made at such time or times, and shall contain such information, as the Office may prescribe. The Office may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section, only if the application therefor meets requirements established by this subsection unless any requirement is specifically waived by the Office. Such grant to a State, or to a general local government under subsection (c) of this section, may cover the costs of developing the program covered by the application. The program covered by the application shall

(1) provide for designation, by the Governor or chief executive authority, of the State office that will have primary authority and responsibility for the development and administration of the program at the State level;

(2) provide, to the extent feasible, for coordination with relevant training available under or supported by other Federal Government programs or grants;

(3) provide for training needs of the State government and of local governments in that State;

(4) provide, to the extent feasible, for intergovernmental cooperation in employee training matters, especially within metropolitan or regional areas; and

(5) provide assurance that the making of a Federal Government grant will not result in a reduction in relevant State or local government expenditures or the substitution of Federal funds for State or local funds previously made available for these purposes.
