##### (q) Hospital readmissions reduction program

(1) In general

With respect to payment for discharges from an applicable hospital (as defined in paragraph (5)(C)) occurring during a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 2012 , in order to account for excess readmissions in the hospital, the Secretary shall make payments (in addition to the payments described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii)) for such a discharge to such hospital under subsection (d) (or section 1395f(b)(3) of this title , as the case may be) in an amount equal to the product of

(A) the base operating DRG payment amount (as defined in paragraph (2)) for the discharge; and

(B) the adjustment factor (described in paragraph (3)(A)) for the hospital for the fiscal year.

(2) Base operating DRG payment amount defined

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in this subsection, the term “base operating DRG payment amount” means, with respect to a hospital for a fiscal year

(i) the payment amount that would otherwise be made under subsection (d) (determined without regard to subsection ( o )) for a discharge if this subsection did not apply; reduced by

(ii) any portion of such payment amount that is attributable to payments under paragraphs (5)(A), (5)(B), (5)(F), and (12) of subsection (d).

(B) Special rules for certain hospitals

(i) Sole community hospitals and medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals

In the case of a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital (with respect to discharges occurring during fiscal years 2012 and 2013) or a sole community hospital, in applying subparagraph (A)(i), the payment amount that would otherwise be made under subsection (d) shall be determined without regard to subparagraphs (I) and (L) of subsection (b)(3) and subparagraphs (D) and (G) of subsection (d)(5).

(ii) Hospitals paid under section 1395f of this title

In the case of a hospital that is paid under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title , the Secretary may exempt such hospitals provided that States paid under such section submit an annual report to the Secretary describing how a similar program in the State for a participating hospital or hospitals achieves or surpasses the measured results in terms of patient health outcomes and cost savings established herein with respect to this section.

(3) Adjustment factor

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (1), subject to subparagraph (D), the adjustment factor under this paragraph for an applicable hospital for a fiscal year is equal to the greater of

(i) the ratio described in subparagraph (B) for the hospital for the applicable period (as defined in paragraph (5)(D)) for such fiscal year; or

(ii) the floor adjustment factor specified in subparagraph (C).

(B) Ratio

The ratio described in this subparagraph for a hospital for an applicable period is equal to 1 minus the ratio of

(i) the aggregate payments for excess readmissions (as defined in paragraph (4)(A)) with respect to an applicable hospital for the applicable period; and

(ii) the aggregate payments for all discharges (as defined in paragraph (4)(B)) with respect to such applicable hospital for such applicable period.

(C) Floor adjustment factor

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the floor adjustment factor specified in this subparagraph for

(i) fiscal year 2013 is 0.99;

(ii) fiscal year 2014 is 0.98; or

(iii) fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal years is 0.97.

(D) Transitional adjustment for dual eligibles

(i) In general

In determining a hospital’s adjustment factor under this paragraph for purposes of making payments for discharges occurring during and after fiscal year 2019, and before the application of clause (i) of subparagraph (E), the Secretary shall assign hospitals to groups (as defined by the Secretary under clause (ii)) and apply the applicable provisions of this subsection using a methodology in a manner that allows for separate comparison of hospitals within each such group, as determined by the Secretary.

(ii) Defining groups

For purposes of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall define groups of hospitals, based on their overall proportion, of the inpatients who are entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under part A, and who are full-benefit dual eligible individuals (as defined in section 1396u–5(c)(6) of this title ). In defining groups, the Secretary shall consult the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and may consider the analysis done by such Commission in preparing the portion of its report submitted to Congress in June 2013 relating to readmissions.

(iii) Minimizing reporting burden on hospitals

In carrying out this subparagraph, the Secretary shall not impose any additional reporting requirements on hospitals.

(iv) Budget neutral design methodology

The Secretary shall design the methodology to implement this subparagraph so that the estimated total amount of reductions in payments under this subsection equals the estimated total amount of reductions in payments that would otherwise occur under this subsection if this subparagraph did not apply.

(E) Changes in risk adjustment

(i) Consideration of recommendations in IMPACT reports

The Secretary may take into account the studies conducted and the recommendations made by the Secretary under section 2(d)(1) of the IMPACT Act of 2014 ( Public Law 113–185 ; 42 U.S.C. 1395 lll note) with respect to the application under this subsection of risk adjustment methodologies. Nothing in this clause shall be construed as precluding consideration of the use of groupings of hospitals.

(ii) Consideration of exclusion of patient cases based on V or other appropriate codes

In promulgating regulations to carry out this subsection with respect to discharges occurring after fiscal year 2018, the Secretary may consider the use of V or other ICD-related codes for removal of a readmission. The Secretary may consider modifying measures under this subsection to incorporate V or other ICD-related codes at the same time as other changes are being made under this subparagraph.

(iii) Removal of certain readmissions

In promulgating regulations to carry out this subsection, with respect to discharges occurring after fiscal year 2018, the Secretary may consider removal as a readmission of an admission that is classified within one or more of the following: transplants, end-stage renal disease, burns, trauma, psychosis, or substance abuse. The Secretary may consider modifying measures under this subsection to remove readmissions at the same time as other changes are being made under this subparagraph.

For purposes of this subsection:

(A) Aggregate payments for excess readmissions

The term “aggregate payments for excess readmissions” means, for a hospital for an applicable period, the sum, for applicable conditions (as defined in paragraph (5)(A)), of the product, for each applicable condition, of

(i) the base operating DRG payment amount for such hospital for such applicable period for such condition;

(ii) the number of admissions for such condition for such hospital for such applicable period; and

(iii) the excess readmissions ratio (as defined in subparagraph (C)) for such hospital for such applicable period minus 1.

(II) the risk adjusted expected readmissions (as determined consistent with such a methodology) for such hospital for such condition with respect to such applicable period.

(ii) Exclusion of certain readmissions

For purposes of clause (i), with respect to a hospital, excess readmissions shall not include readmissions for an applicable condition for which there are fewer than a minimum number (as determined by the Secretary) of discharges for such applicable condition for the applicable period and such hospital.
