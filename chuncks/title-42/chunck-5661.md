#### § 423. Disability insurance benefit payments
##### (g) Continued payment of disability benefits during appeal

(1) In any case where

(A) an individual is a recipient of disability insurance benefits, or of child’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefits based on disability,

(B) the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are payable is found to have ceased, not to have existed, or to no longer be disabling, and as a consequence such individual is determined not to be entitled to such benefits, and

(C) a timely request for a hearing under section 421(d) of this title , or for an administrative review prior to such hearing, is pending with respect to the determination that he is not so entitled, such individual may elect (in such manner and form and within such time as the Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulations prescribe) to have the payment of such benefits, the payment of any other benefits under this subchapter based on such individual’s wages and self-employment income, the payment of mother’s or father’s insurance benefits to such individual’s mother or father based on the disability of such individual as a child who has attained age 16, and the payment of benefits under subchapter XVIII based on such individual’s disability, continued for an additional period beginning with the first month beginning after January 12, 1983 , for which (under such determination) such benefits are no longer otherwise payable, and ending with the earlier of (i) the month preceding the month in which a decision is made after such a hearing, or (ii) the month preceding the month in which no such request for a hearing or an administrative review is pending.

(2)

(A) If an individual elects to have the payment of his benefits continued for an additional period under paragraph (1), and the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security affirms the determination that he is not entitled to such benefits, any benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to such election (for months in such additional period) shall be considered overpayments for all purposes of this subchapter, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B).

(B) If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the individual’s appeal of his termination of benefits was made in good faith, all of the benefits paid pursuant to such individual’s election under paragraph (1) shall be subject to waiver consideration under the provisions of section 404 of this title . In making for purposes of this subparagraph any determination of whether any individual’s appeal is made in good faith, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language).
