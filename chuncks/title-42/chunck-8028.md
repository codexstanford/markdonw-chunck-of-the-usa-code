#### § 1395ss. Certification of medicare supplemental health insurance policies
##### (q) Guaranteed renewal of policies; termination; suspension

The requirements of this subsection are as follows:

(1) Each medicare supplemental policy shall be guaranteed renewable and

(A) the issuer may not cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of health status of the individual; and

(B) the issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation.

(2) If the medicare supplemental policy is terminated by the group policyholder and is not replaced as provided under paragraph (4), the issuer shall offer certificateholders an individual medicare supplemental policy which (at the option of the certificateholder)

(A) provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy, or

(B) provides for such benefits as otherwise meets  3 the requirements of this section.

(3) If an individual is a certificateholder in a group medicare supplemental policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall

(A) offer the certificateholder the conversion opportunity described in paragraph (2), or

(B) at the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificateholder continuation of coverage under the group policy.

(4) If a group medicare supplemental policy is replaced by another group medicare supplemental policy purchased by the same policyholder, issuer  4 of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new group policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.

(5)

(A) Each medicare supplemental policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder for the period (not to exceed 24 months) in which the policyholder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under subchapter XIX, but only if the policyholder notifies the issuer of such policy within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to such assistance. If such suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses entitlement to such medical assistance, such policy shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of termination of such entitlement) under terms described in subsection (n)(6)(A)(ii) as of the termination of such entitlement if the policyholder provides notice of loss of such entitlement within 90 days after the date of such loss.

(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the authority of a State, under subchapter XIX, to purchase a medicare supplemental policy for an individual otherwise entitled to assistance under such subchapter.

(C) Any person who issues a medicare supplemental policy and fails to comply with the requirements of this paragraph or paragraph (6) is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .

(6) Each medicare supplemental policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder if the policyholder is entitled to benefits under section 426(b) of this title and is covered under a group health plan (as defined in section 1395y(b)(1)(A)(v) of this title ). If such suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses coverage under the group health plan, such policy shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of such loss of coverage) under terms described in subsection (n)(6)(A)(ii) as of the loss of such coverage if the policyholder provides notice of loss of such coverage within 90 days after the date of such loss.
