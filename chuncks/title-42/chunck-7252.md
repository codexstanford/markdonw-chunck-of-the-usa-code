(A) The Secretary shall establish a fee schedule for services of certified registered nurse anesthetists under section 1395x(s)(11) of this title .

(B) In establishing the fee schedule under this paragraph the Secretary may utilize a system of time units, a system of base and time units, or any appropriate methodology.

(C) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to certain services furnished in certain hospitals in rural areas under the provisions of section 9320(k) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended by section 6132 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the fee schedule established under paragraph (1) shall be initially based on audited data from cost reporting periods ending in fiscal year 1985 and such other data as the Secretary determines necessary.

(3)

(A) In establishing the initial fee schedule for those services, the Secretary shall adjust the fee schedule to the extent necessary to ensure that the estimated total amount which will be paid under this subchapter for those services plus applicable coinsurance in 1989 will equal the estimated total amount which would be paid under this subchapter for those services in 1989 if the services were included as inpatient hospital services and payment for such services was made under part A in the same manner as payment was made in fiscal year 1987, adjusted to take into account changes in prices and technology relating to the administration of anesthesia.

(B) The Secretary shall also reduce the prevailing charge of physicians for medical direction of a certified registered nurse anesthetist, or the fee schedule for services of certified registered nurse anesthetists, or both, to the extent necessary to ensure that the estimated total amount which will be paid under this subchapter plus applicable coinsurance for such medical direction and such services in 1989 and 1990 will not exceed the estimated total amount which would have been paid plus applicable coinsurance but for the enactment of the amendments made by section 9320 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. A reduced prevailing charge under this subparagraph shall become the prevailing charge but for subsequent years for purposes of applying the economic index under the fourth sentence of section 1395u(b)(3) of this title .
