##### (p) Breast cancer screening surveillance research grants

(1) Research

(A) Grants

The Secretary shall award grants to such entities as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate to establish surveillance systems in selected geographic areas to provide data to evaluate the functioning and effectiveness of breast cancer screening programs in the United States, including assessments of participation rates in screening mammography, diagnostic procedures, incidence of breast cancer, mode of detection (mammography screening or other methods), outcome and follow up information, and such related epidemiologic analyses that may improve early cancer detection and contribute to reduction in breast cancer mortality. Grants may be awarded for further research on breast cancer surveillance systems upon the Secretary’s review of the evaluation of the program.

(B) Use of funds

Grants awarded under subparagraph (A) may be used

(i) to study

(I) methods to link mammography and clinical breast examination records with population-based cancer registry data;

(II) methods to provide diagnostic outcome data, or facilitate the communication of diagnostic outcome data, to radiology facilities for purposes of evaluating patterns of mammography interpretation; and

(III) mechanisms for limiting access and maintaining confidentiality of all stored data; and

(ii) to conduct pilot testing of the methods and mechanisms described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (i) on a limited basis.

(C) Grant application

To be eligible to receive funds under this paragraph, an entity shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.

(D) Report

A recipient of a grant under this paragraph shall submit a report to the Secretary containing the results of the study and testing conducted under clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (B), along with recommendations for methods of establishing a breast cancer screening surveillance system.

(2) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a breast cancer screening surveillance system based on the recommendations contained in the report described in paragraph (1)(D).

(3) Standards and procedures

The Secretary shall establish standards and procedures for the operation of the breast cancer screening surveillance system, including procedures to maintain confidentiality of patient records.

(4) Information

The Secretary shall recruit facilities to provide to the breast cancer screening surveillance system relevant data that could help in the research of the causes, characteristics, and prevalence of, and potential treatments for, breast cancer and benign breast conditions, if the information may be disclosed under section 552 of title 5 .
