##### (f) Rights of program beneficiaries

(1) In general

If an individual who is a program beneficiary or a prospective program beneficiary objects to the religious character of a program participant, within a reasonable period of time after the date of such objection such program participant shall refer such individual to, and the appropriate Federal, State, or local government that administers a designated program or is a program participant shall provide to such individual (if otherwise eligible for such services), program services that

(B) have a value that is not less than the value of the services that the individual would have received from the program participant to which the individual had such objection. Upon referring a program beneficiary to an alternative provider, the program participant shall notify the appropriate Federal, State, or local government agency that administers the program of such referral.

(2) Notices

Program participants, public agencies that refer individuals to designated programs, and the appropriate Federal, State, or local governments that administer designated programs or are program participants shall ensure that notice is provided to program beneficiaries or prospective program beneficiaries of their rights under this section.

(3) Additional requirements

A program participant making a referral pursuant to paragraph (1) shall

(A) prior to making such referral, consider any list that the State or local government makes available of entities in the geographic area that provide program services; and

(B) ensure that the individual makes contact with the alternative provider to which the individual is referred.

(4) Nondiscrimination

A religious organization that is a program participant shall not in providing program services or engaging in outreach activities under designated programs discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.
