#### § 19052. Research ethics
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) a number of emerging areas of research have potential ethical, social, safety, and security implications that might be apparent as early as the basic research stage;

(2) the incorporation of ethical, social, safety, and security considerations into the research design and review process for Federal awards, may help mitigate potential harms before they happen;

(3) the Foundation’s agreement with the National Academies to conduct a study and make recommendations with respect to governance of research in emerging technologies is a positive step toward accomplishing this goal; and

(4) the Foundation should continue to work with stakeholders to promote best practices for governance of research in emerging technologies at every stage of research.
