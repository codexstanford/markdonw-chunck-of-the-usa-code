##### (d) Incentives

(1) Performance target

The Secretary shall establish for each health care group participating in a demonstration under this section

(A) a base expenditure amount, equal to the average total payments under parts A and B for patients served by the health care group on a fee-for-service basis in a base period determined by the Secretary; and

(B) an annual per capita expenditure target for patients determined to be within the scope of the demonstration, reflecting the base expenditure amount adjusted for risk and expected growth rates.

(2) Incentive bonus

The Secretary shall pay to each participating health care group (subject to paragraph (4)) a bonus for each year under the demonstration equal to a portion of the medicare savings realized for such year relative to the performance target.

(3) Additional bonus for process and outcome improvements

At such time as the Secretary has established appropriate criteria based on evidence the Secretary determines to be sufficient, the Secretary shall also pay to a participating health care group (subject to paragraph (4)) an additional bonus for a year, equal to such portion as the Secretary may designate of the saving to the program under this subchapter resulting from process improvements made by and patient outcome improvements attributable to activities of the group.

(4) Limitation

The Secretary shall limit bonus payments under this section as necessary to ensure that the aggregate expenditures under this subchapter (inclusive of bonus payments) with respect to patients within the scope of the demonstration do not exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates would be expended if the demonstration projects under this section were not implemented.
