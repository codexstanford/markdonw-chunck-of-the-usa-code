##### (b) Interest on loan

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, each State shall pay interest on any advance made to such State under section 1321 of this title . Interest so payable with respect to periods during any calendar year shall be at the rate determined under paragraph (4) for such calendar year.

(2) No interest shall be required to be paid under paragraph (1) with respect to any advance or advances made during any calendar year if

(A) such advances are repaid in full before the close of September 30 of the calendar year in which the advances were made,

(B) no other advance was made to such State under section 1321 of this title during such calendar year and after the date on which the repayment of the advances was completed, and

(C) such State meets funding goals, established under regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor, relating to the accounts of the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund.

(3)

(A) Interest payable under paragraph (1) which was attributable to periods during any fiscal year shall be paid by the State to the Secretary of the Treasury prior to the first day of the following fiscal year. If interest is payable under paragraph (1) on any advance (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “first advance”) by reason of another advance made to such State after September 30 of the calendar year in which the first advance was made, interest on such first advance attributable to periods before such September 30 shall be paid not later than the day after the date on which the other advance was made.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of any advance made during the last 5 months of any fiscal year, interest on such advance attributable to periods during such fiscal year shall not be required to be paid before the last day of the succeeding taxable year. Any interest the time for payment of which is deferred by the preceding sentence shall bear interest in the same manner as if it were an advance made on the day on which it would have been required to be paid but for this subparagraph.
