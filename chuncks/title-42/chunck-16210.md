### CHAPTER 85— AIR POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 7429. Solid waste combustion
##### (e) Permits

Beginning (1) 36 months after the promulgation of a performance standard under subsection (a) and section 7411 of this title applicable to a category of solid waste incineration units, or (2) the effective date of a permit program under subchapter V in the State in which the unit is located, whichever is later, each unit in the category shall operate pursuant to a permit issued under this subsection and subchapter V. Permits required by this subsection may be renewed according to the provisions of subchapter V. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, each permit for a solid waste incineration unit combusting municipal waste issued under this chapter shall be issued for a period of up to 12 years and shall be reviewed every 5 years after date of issuance or reissuance. Each permit shall continue in effect after the date of issuance until the date of termination, unless the Administrator or State determines that the unit is not in compliance with all standards and conditions contained in the permit. Such determination shall be made at regular intervals during the term of the permit, such intervals not to exceed 5 years, and only after public comment and public hearing. No permit for a solid waste incineration unit may be issued under this chapter by an agency, instrumentality or person that is also responsible, in whole or part, for the design and construction or operation of the unit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Administrator or the State shall require the owner or operator of any unit to comply with emissions limitations or implement any other measures, if the Administrator or the State determines that emissions in the absence of such limitations or measures may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or the environment. The Administrator’s determination under the preceding sentence is a discretionary decision.
