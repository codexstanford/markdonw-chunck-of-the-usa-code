##### (o) Optional hospice benefits

(1)

(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the term “hospice care” means the care described in section 1395x(dd)(1) of this title furnished by a hospice program (as defined in section 1395x(dd)(2) of this title ) to a terminally ill individual who has voluntarily elected (in accordance with paragraph (2)) to have payment made for hospice care instead of having payment made for certain benefits described in section 1395d(d)(2)(A) of this title and for which payment may otherwise be made under subchapter XVIII and intermediate care facility services under the plan. For purposes of such election, hospice care may be provided to an individual while such individual is a resident of a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility, but the only payment made under the State plan shall be for the hospice care.

(B) For purposes of this subchapter, with respect to the definition of hospice program under section 1395x(dd)(2) of this title , the Secretary may allow an agency or organization to make the assurance under subparagraph (A)(iii) of such section without taking into account any individual who is afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

(C) A voluntary election to have payment made for hospice care for a child (as defined by the State) shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of the child to be provided with, or to have payment made under this subchapter for, services that are related to the treatment of the child’s condition for which a diagnosis of terminal illness has been made.

(2) An individual’s voluntary election under this subsection

(A) shall be made in accordance with procedures that are established by the State and that are consistent with the procedures established under section 1395d(d)(2) of this title ;

(B) shall be for such a period or periods (which need not be the same periods described in section 1395d(d)(1) of this title ) as the State may establish; and

(C) may be revoked at any time without a showing of cause and may be modified so as to change the hospice program with respect to which a previous election was made.

(3) In the case of an individual

(A) who is residing in a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded and is receiving medical assistance for services in such facility under the plan,

(B) who is entitled to benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII and has elected, under section 1395d(d) of this title , to receive hospice care under such part, and

(C) with respect to whom the hospice program under such subchapter and the nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded have entered into a written agreement under which the program takes full responsibility for the professional management of the individual’s hospice care and the facility agrees to provide room and board to the individual, instead of any payment otherwise made under the plan with respect to the facility’s services, the State shall provide for payment to the hospice program of an amount equal to the additional amount determined in section 1396a(a)(13)(B) of this title and, if the individual is an individual described in section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title , shall provide for payment of any coinsurance amounts imposed under section 1395e(a)(4) of this title .
