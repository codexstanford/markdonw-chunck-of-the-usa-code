(ii) In no case shall the reduction under clause (i) for a surgical procedure result in a prevailing charge in a locality for a year which is less than 75 percent of the weighted national average of such prevailing charges for such procedure for all the localities in the United States for 1986.

(C)

(i) The prevailing charge level determined with respect to A-mode ophthalmic ultrasound procedures may not exceed 5 percent of the prevailing charge level established with respect to extracapsular cataract removal with lens insertion.

(A) In determining payments under section 1395 l ( l ) of this title and section 1395w–4 of this title for anesthesia services furnished on or after January 1, 1994 , the methodology for determining the base and time units used shall be the same for services furnished by physicians, for medical direction by physicians of two, three, or four certified registered nurse anesthetists, or for services furnished by a certified registered nurse anesthetist (whether or not medically directed) and shall be based on the methodology in effect, for anesthesia services furnished by physicians, as of August 10, 1993 .

(B) The Secretary shall require claims for physicians’ services for medical direction of nurse anesthetists during the periods in which the provisions of subparagraph (A) apply to indicate the number of such anesthetists being medically directed concurrently at any time during the procedure, the name of each nurse anesthetist being directed, and the type of procedure for which the services are provided.

(14)

(A)

(i) In determining the reasonable charge for a physicians’ service specified in subparagraph (C)(i) and furnished during the 9-month period beginning on April 1, 1990 , the prevailing charge for such service shall be the prevailing charge otherwise recognized for such service for 1989 reduced by 15 percent or, if less, ⅓ of the percent (if any) by which the prevailing charge otherwise applied in the locality in 1989 exceeds the locally-adjusted reduced prevailing amount (as determined under subparagraph (B)(i)) for the service.

(ii) In determining the reasonable charge for a physicians’ service specified in subparagraph (C)(i) and furnished during 1991, the prevailing charge for such service shall be the prevailing charge otherwise recognized for such service for the period during 1990 beginning on April 1, reduced by the same amount as the amount of the reduction effected under this paragraph (as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) for such service during such period.

(B) For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) The “locally-adjusted reduced prevailing amount” for a locality for a physicians’ service is equal to the product of

(I) the reduced national weighted average prevailing charge for the service (specified under clause (ii)), and

(II) the adjustment factor (specified under clause (iii)) for the locality.

(ii) The “reduced national weighted average prevailing charge” for a physicians’ service is equal to the national weighted average prevailing charge for the service (specified in subparagraph (C)(ii)) reduced by the percentage change (specified in subparagraph (C)(iii)) for the service.

(iii) The “adjustment factor”, for a physicians’ service for a locality, is the sum of

(I) the practice expense component (percent), divided by 100, specified in appendix A (pages 187 through 194) of the Report of the Medicare and Medicaid Health Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1989, prepared by the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, (Committee Print 101–M, 101st Congress, 1st Session) for the service, multiplied by the geographic practice cost index value (specified in subparagraph (C)(iv)) for the locality, and

(II) 1 minus the practice expense component (percent), divided by 100.

(C) For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) The physicians’ services specified in this clause are the procedures specified (by code and description) in the Overvalued Procedures List for Finance Committee, Revised September 20, 1989 , prepared by the Physician Payment Review Commission which specification is of physicians’ services that have been identified as overvalued by at least 10 percent based on a comparison of payments for such services under a resource-based relative value scale and of the national average prevailing charges under this part.

(ii) The “national weighted average prevailing charge” specified in this clause, for a physicians’ service specified in clause (i), is the national weighted average prevailing charge for the service in 1989 as determined by the Secretary using the best data available.

(iii) The “percentage change” specified in this clause, for a physicians’ service specified in clause (i), is the percent difference (but expressed as a positive number) specified for the service in the list referred to in clause (i).

(iv) The geographic practice cost index value specified in this clause for a locality is the Geographic Overhead Costs Index specified for the locality in table 1 of the September 1989 Supplement to the Geographic Medicare Economic Index: Alternative Approaches (prepared by the Urban Institute and the Center for Health Economics Research).

(D) In the case of a reduction in the prevailing charge for a physicians’ service under subparagraph (A), if a nonparticipating physician furnishes the service to an individual entitled to benefits under this part, after the effective date of such reduction, the physician’s actual charge is subject to a limit under subsection (j)(1)(D).

(15)

(A) In determining the reasonable charge for surgery, radiology, and diagnostic physicians’ services which the Secretary shall designate (based on their high volume of expenditures under this part) and for which the prevailing charge (but for this paragraph) differs by physician specialty, the prevailing charge for such a service may not exceed the prevailing charge or fee schedule amount for that specialty of physicians that furnish the service most frequently nationally.

(B) In the case of a reduction in the prevailing charge for a physician’s service under subparagraph (A), if a nonparticipating physician furnishes the service to an individual entitled to benefits under this part, after the effective date of the reduction, the physician’s actual charge is subject to a limit under subsection (j)(1)(D).

(16)

(A) In determining the reasonable charge for all physicians’ services other than physicians’ services specified in subparagraph (B) furnished during 1991, the prevailing charge for a locality shall be 6.5 percent below the prevailing charges used in the locality under this part in 1990 after March 31.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the physicians’ services specified in this subparagraph are as follows:

(i) Radiology, anesthesia and physician pathology services, the technical components of diagnostic tests specified in paragraph (17) and physicians’ services specified in paragraph (14)(C)(i).

(17) With respect to payment under this part for the technical (as distinct from professional) component of diagnostic tests (other than clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, tests specified in paragraph (14)(C)(i), and radiology services, including portable x-ray services) which the Secretary shall designate (based on their high volume of expenditures under this part), the reasonable charge for such technical component (including the applicable portion of a global service) may not exceed the national median of such charges for all localities, as estimated by the Secretary using the best available data.

(18)

(A) Payment for any service furnished by a practitioner described in subparagraph (C) and for which payment may be made under this part on a reasonable charge or fee schedule basis may only be made under this part on an assignment-related basis.

(B) A practitioner described in subparagraph (C) or other person may not bill (or collect any amount from) the individual or another person for any service described in subparagraph (A), except for deductible and coinsurance amounts applicable under this part. No person is liable for payment of any amounts billed for such a service in violation of the previous sentence. If a practitioner or other person knowingly and willfully bills (or collects an amount) for such a service in violation of such sentence, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the practitioner or other person in the same manner as the Secretary may apply sanctions against a physician in accordance with subsection (j)(2) in the same manner as such section applies with respect to a physician.

(19) For purposes of section 1395 l (a)(1) of this title, the reasonable charge for ambulance services (as described in section 1395x(s)(7) of this title ) provided during calendar year 1998 and calendar year 1999 may not exceed the reasonable charge for such services provided during the previous calendar year (after application of this paragraph), increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with the midpoint of the year involved reduced by 1.0 percentage point.
