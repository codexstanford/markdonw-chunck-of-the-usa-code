In this subsection, the term “eligible individual” means an individual who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a full-time or part-time student in a school of nursing.

An individual may complete the period of service described in subparagraph (A) on a part-time basis if the individual has a written agreement that

(i) is entered into by the facility and the individual and is approved by the Secretary; and

(ii) provides that the period of obligated service will be extended so that the aggregate amount of service performed will equal the amount of service that would be performed through a period of full-time service of not less than 2 years.

(4) Applicability of certain provisions

The provisions of subpart III of part D of subchapter II shall, except as inconsistent with this section, apply to the program established in paragraph (1) in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions apply to the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program established in such subpart.
