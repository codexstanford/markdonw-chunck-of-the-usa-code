(C) Risk communication and public preparedness.

(D) Rapid distribution and administration of medical countermeasures.

(E) Response to environmental hazards.

(3) Medical

Increasing the preparedness, response capabilities, and surge capacity of hospitals, other health care facilities (including pharmacies, mental health facilities, and ambulatory care facilities and which may include dental health facilities), and trauma care, critical care, and emergency medical service systems, with respect to public health emergencies (including related availability, accessibility, and coordination), which shall include developing plans for the following:

(F) Protecting health care workers and health care first responders from workplace exposures during a public health emergency or exposures to agents that could cause a public health emergency.

(G) Optimizing a coordinated and flexible approach to the emergency response and medical surge capacity of hospitals, other health care facilities, critical care, trauma care (which may include trauma centers), and emergency medical systems.

(4) At-risk individuals

Minimizing duplication of, and ensuring coordination between, Federal, State, local, and tribal planning, preparedness, and response activities (including the State Emergency Management Assistance Compact and other applicable compacts). Such planning shall be consistent with the National Response Plan, or any successor plan, and National Incident Management System and the National Preparedness Goal.

(6) Continuity of operations

Maintaining vital public health and medical services to allow for optimal Federal, State, local, and tribal operations in the event of a public health emergency.

(8) Medical and public health community resiliency

Strengthening the ability of States, local communities, and tribal communities to prepare for, respond to, and be resilient in the event of public health emergencies, whether naturally occurring, unintentional, or deliberate by

(A) optimizing alignment and integration of medical and public health preparedness and response planning and capabilities with and into routine daily activities; and

(B) promoting familiarity with local medical and public health systems.

(9) Zoonotic disease, food, and agriculture

(10) Global health security

Assessing current or potential health security threats from abroad to inform domestic public health preparedness and response capabilities.
