##### (a) Federal share; apportionment of remainder; annual budget; estimates of proposed Federal appropriations; advances against delayed State appropriations; credit to account in the Treasury

Each commission shall recommend what share of its expenses shall be borne by the Federal Government, but such share shall be subject to approval by the Council. The remainder of the commission’s expenses shall be otherwise apportioned as the commission may determine. Each commission shall prepare a budget annually and transmit it to the Council and the States. Estimates of proposed appropriations from the Federal Government shall be included in the budget estimates submitted by the Council under chapter 11 of title 31, and may include an amount for advance to a commission against State appropriations for which delay is anticipated by reason of later legislative sessions. All sums appropriated to or otherwise received by a commission shall be credited to the commission’s account in the Treasury of the United States.
