(2) draws on community input, information contained in research proposals, allocation requests, insights from Foundation-funded cyber-infrastructure operators, and Foundation-wide information gathering regarding community needs;

(3) considers computational needs of planned major facilities;

(4) reflects anticipated technology trends;

(5) informs users and potential partners about future facilities and services;

(6) addresses the needs of groups historically underrepresented in STEM and geographic regions with low availability and high demand for advanced computing resources;

(7) considers how Foundation-supported advanced computing capabilities can be leveraged for activities through the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships; and

(8) provides an update to Congress about the level of funding necessary to fully meet computational resource needs for the research community.
