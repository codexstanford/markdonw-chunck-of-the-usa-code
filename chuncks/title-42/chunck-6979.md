### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1382h. Benefits for individuals who perform substantial gainful activity despite severe medical impairment
##### (b) Blind or disabled individuals receiving supplemental security income benefits

(1) Except as provided in section 1383(j) of this title , for purposes of subchapter XIX, any individual who was determined to be a blind or disabled individual eligible to receive a benefit under section 1382 of this title or any federally administered State supplementary payment for a month and who in a subsequent month is ineligible for benefits under this subchapter (and for any federally administered State supplementary payments) because of his or her income shall, nevertheless, be considered to be receiving supplemental security income benefits for such subsequent month provided that the Commissioner of Social Security determines under regulations that

(A) such individual continues to be blind or continues to have the disabling physical or mental impairment on the basis of which he was found to be under a disability and, except for his earnings, meets all non-disability-related requirements for eligibility for benefits under this subchapter;

(B) the income of such individual would not, except for his earnings and increases pursuant to section 415(i) of this title in the level of monthly insurance benefits to which the individual is entitled under subchapter II that occur while such individual is considered to be receiving supplemental security income benefits by reason of this subsection, be equal to or in excess of the amount which would cause him to be ineligible for payments under section 1382(b) of this title (if he were otherwise eligible for such payments);

(C) the termination of eligibility for benefits under subchapter XIX would seriously inhibit his ability to continue his employment; and

(D) such individual’s earnings are not sufficient to allow him to provide for himself a reasonable equivalent of the benefits under this subchapter (including any federally administered State supplementary payments), benefits under subchapter XIX, and publicly funded attendant care services (including personal care assistance), which would be available to him in the absence of such earnings.

(2)

(A) Determinations made under paragraph (1)(D) shall be based on information and data updated no less frequently than annually.

(B) In determining an individual’s earnings for purposes of paragraph (1)(D), there shall be excluded from such earnings an amount equal to the sum of any amounts which are or would be excluded under clauses (ii) and (iv) of section 1382a(b)(4)(B) of this title (or under clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 1382a(b)(4)(A) of this title ) in determining his or her income.

(3) In the case of a State that exercises the option under section 1396a(f) of this title , any individual who

(A)

(i) qualifies for a benefit under subsection (a), or

(ii) meets the requirements of paragraph (1); and

(B) was eligible for medical assistance under the State plan approved under subchapter XIX in the month immediately preceding the first month in which the individual qualified for a benefit under such subsection or met such requirements, shall remain eligible for medical assistance under such plan for so long as the individual qualifies for a benefit under such subsection or meets such requirements.
