### CHAPTER 152— ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY
#### § 17194. Enhanced geothermal systems research and development
##### (c) Frontier observatory for research in geothermal energy

(1) In general

The Secretary shall support the establishment and construction of up to 3 field research sites, which shall each be known as a “Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy” or “FORGE” site to develop, test, and enhance techniques and tools for enhanced geothermal energy.

(2) Duties

The Secretary shall

(A) provide financial assistance in support of research and development projects focused on advanced monitoring technologies, new technologies and approaches for implementing multi-zone stimulations, nonstimulation techniques, and dynamic reservoir modeling that incorporates all available high-fidelity characterization data; and

(B) seek opportunities to coordinate efforts and share information with domestic and international partners engaged in research and development of geothermal systems and related technology, including coordination between FORGE sites.

(3) Site selection

Of the FORGE sites referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) consider applications through a competitive, merit-reviewed process, from National Laboratories, multi-institutional collaborations, institutes of higher education and other appropriate entities best suited to provide national leadership on geothermal related issues and perform the duties enumerated under this subsection;

(B) prioritize existing field sites and facilities with capabilities relevant to the duties enumerated under this subsection;

(C) determine the mission need for and potential location of subsequent FORGE sites following the completion of construction and one year of operation of two FORGE sites; and

(D) ensure geologic diversity among FORGE sites when developing subsequent sites, to the maximum extent practicable.

(4) Existing forge sites

A FORGE site already in existence on December 27, 2020 , may continue to receive support.

(5) Site operation

(A) Initial duration

FORGE sites selected under paragraph (3) shall operate for an initial term of not more than 7 years after the date on which site operation begins.

(B) Performance metrics

The Secretary shall establish performance metrics for each FORGE site supported under this paragraph, which may be used by the Secretary to determine whether a FORGE site should continue to receive funding.

(6) Additional terms

(A) In general

At the end of an operational term described in subparagraph (B), a FORGE site may

(i) be transferred to other public or private entities for further enhanced geothermal testing; or

(ii) subject to appropriations and a merit review by the Secretary, operate for an additional term of not more than 7 years.

(B) Operational term described

An operational term referred to in subparagraph (A)

(i) in the case of an existing FORGE site, is the existing operational term; and

(ii) in the case of new FORGE sites selected under paragraph (3), is the initial term under paragraph (5)(A) or an additional term under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph.

(7) Funding

(A) In general

Out of funds authorized to be appropriated under section 17202 of this title , there shall be made available to the Secretary to carry out the FORGE activities under this paragraph

(i) $45,000,000 for fiscal year 2021;

(ii) $55,000,000 for fiscal year 2022;

(iii) $65,000,000 for fiscal year 2023;

(iv) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2024; and

(v) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2025.

(B) Considerations

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the balance between funds dedicated to construction and operations and research activities to reflect the state of site development.
