#### § 1397a. Payments to States
##### (d) Transfers of funds

A State may transfer up to 10 percent of its allotment under section 1397b of this title for any fiscal year for its use for that year under other provisions of Federal law providing block grants for support of health services, health promotion and disease prevention activities, or low-income home energy assistance (or any combination of those activities). Amounts allotted to a State under any provisions of Federal law referred to in the preceding sentence and transferred by a State for use in carrying out the purposes of this division shall be treated as if they were paid to the State under this division but shall not affect the computation of the State’s allotment under this division. The State shall inform the Secretary of any such transfer of funds.
