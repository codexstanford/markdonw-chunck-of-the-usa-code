### CHAPTER 97— ACID PRECIPITATION PROGRAM AND CARBON DIOXIDE STUDY
#### § 8901. Introductory provisions
##### (a) Congressional statement of findings and purpose

The Congress finds and declares that acid precipitation resulting from other than natural sources

(1) could contribute to the increasing pollution of natural and man-made water systems;

(2) could adversely affect agricultural and forest crops;

(3) could adversely affect fish and wildlife and natural ecosystems generally;

(4) could contribute to corrosion of metals, wood, paint, and masonry used in construction and ornamentation of buildings and public monuments;

(5) could adversely affect public health and welfare; and

(6) could affect areas distant from sources and thus involve issues of national and international policy.
