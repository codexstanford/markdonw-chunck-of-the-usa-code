### CHAPTER 50— NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE
#### § 4001. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
##### (b) Participation of Federal Government in flood insurance program carried out by private insurance industry

The Congress also finds that (1) many factors have made it uneconomic for the private insurance industry alone to make flood insurance available to those in need of such protection on reasonable terms and conditions; but (2) a program of flood insurance with large-scale participation of the Federal Government and carried out to the maximum extent practicable by the private insurance industry is feasible and can be initiated.
