#### § 1202. State plans for aid to blind
###### (b) The Secretary shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a), except that he shall not approve any plan which imposes, as a condition of eligibility for aid to the blind under the plan

(1) Any residence requirement which excludes any resident of the State who has resided therein five years during the nine years immediately preceding the application for aid and has resided therein continuously for one year immediately preceding the application; or

(2) Any citizenship requirement which excludes any citizen of the United States. At the option of the State, the plan may provide that manuals and other policy issuances will be furnished to persons without charge for the reasonable cost of such materials, but such provision shall not be required by the Secretary as a condition for the approval of such plan under this subchapter. In the case of any State (other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands) which did not have on January 1, 1949 , a State plan for aid to the blind approved under this subchapter, the Secretary shall approve a plan of such State for aid to the blind for purposes of this subchapter, even though it does not meet the requirements of clause (8) of subsection (a) of this section, if it meets all other requirements of this subchapter for an approved plan for aid to the blind; but payments under section 1203 of this title shall be made, in the case of any such plan, only with respect to expenditures thereunder which would be included as expenditures for the purposes of section 1203 of this title under a plan approved under this section without regard to the provisions of this sentence.
