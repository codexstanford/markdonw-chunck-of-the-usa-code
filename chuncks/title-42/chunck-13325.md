### CHAPTER 66— DOMESTIC VOLUNTEER SERVICES
#### § 5011. Grants and contracts for individual service projects
##### (d) Domestic Volunteer Service; allowances, stipends, and other support

The Director, in accordance with regulations the Director shall prescribe, may provide to low-income persons serving as volunteers under this part, such allowances, stipends, and other support as the Director determines are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part. Any stipend or allowance provided under this section shall not be less than $3.00 per hour, except that (1) such stipend or allowance shall not be increased as a result of an amendment made to this sentence unless the funds appropriated for carrying out this part are sufficient to maintain for the fiscal year in question a number of participants to serve under this part at least equal to the number of such participants serving during the preceding fiscal year, and (2) in the event that sufficient appropriations for any fiscal year are not available to increase any such stipend or allowance provided to the minimum hourly rate specified in this sentence, the Director shall increase the stipend or allowance to such amount as appropriations for such year permit consistent with clause (1) of this exception. In establishing the amount of, and the effective date for, such adjustment, the Director, in consultation with the State Commissions on National and Community Service (as established under section 12638 of this title ) and the heads of the State offices established under section 12651f of this title , shall consider the effect such adjustment will have on the ability of non-federally funded volunteer programs similar to the programs under this subchapter to maintain their current level of volunteer hours.
