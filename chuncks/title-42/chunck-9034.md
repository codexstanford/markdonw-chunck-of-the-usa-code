#### § 1437g. Public housing Capital and Operating Funds
##### (g) Limitations on use of funds

(1) Flexibility in use of funds

(A) Flexibility for Capital Fund amounts

Of any amounts appropriated for fiscal year 2000 or any fiscal year thereafter that are allocated for fiscal year 2000 or any fiscal year thereafter from the Capital Fund for any public housing agency, the agency may use not more than 20 percent for activities that are eligible under subsection (e) for assistance with amounts from the Operating Fund, but only if the public housing agency plan for the agency provides for such use.

(B) Flexibility for Operating Fund amounts

Of any amounts appropriated for fiscal year 2016 or any fiscal year thereafter that are allocated for fiscal year 2016 or any fiscal year thereafter from the Operating Fund for any public housing agency, the agency may use not more than 20 percent for activities that are eligible under subsection (d) for assistance with amounts from the Capital Fund, but only if the public housing plan under section 1437c–1 of this title for the agency provides for such use.

(2) Full flexibility for small PHAs

Of any amounts allocated for any fiscal year for any public housing agency that owns or operates less than 250 public housing dwelling units, is not designated pursuant to section 1437d(j)(2) of this title as a troubled public housing agency, and (in the determination of the Secretary) is operating and maintaining its public housing in a safe, clean, and healthy condition, the agency may use any such amounts for any eligible activities under subsections (d)(1) and (e)(1), regardless of the fund from which the amounts were allocated and provided. This subsection shall take effect on October 21, 1998 .

(3) Limitation on new construction

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a public housing agency may not use any of the amounts allocated for the agency from the Capital Fund or Operating Fund for the purpose of constructing any public housing unit, if such construction would result in a net increase from the number of public housing units owned, assisted, or operated by the public housing agency on October 1, 1999 , including any public housing units demolished as part of any revitalization effort.

(B) Exception regarding use of assistance

A public housing agency may use amounts allocated for the agency from the Capital Fund or Operating Fund for the construction and operation of housing units that are available and affordable to low-income families in excess of the limitations on new construction set forth in subparagraph (A), but the formulas established under subsections (d)(2) and (e)(2) shall not provide additional funding for the specific purpose of allowing construction and operation of housing in excess of those limitations (except to the extent provided in subparagraph (C)).

(C) Exception regarding formulas

Subject to reasonable limitations set by the Secretary, the formulas established under subsections (d)(2) and (e)(2) may provide additional funding for the operation and modernization costs (but not the initial development costs) of housing in excess of amounts otherwise permitted under this paragraph, and such amounts may be so used, if

(i) such units are part of a mixed-finance project or otherwise leverage significant additional private or public investment; and

(ii) the estimated cost of the useful life of the project is less than the estimated cost of providing tenant-based assistance under section 1437f( o ) of this title for the same period of time.
