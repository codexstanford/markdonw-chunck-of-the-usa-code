######## (B) In this subsection, the term “broad-based health care related tax” means a health care related tax which is imposed with respect to a class of health care items or services (as described in paragraph (7)(A)) or with respect to providers of such items or services and which, except as provided in subparagraphs (D), (E), and (F)
######### (i) Subject to clause (ii), for purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii), a tax is considered to be imposed uniformly if

(I) in the case of a tax consisting of a licensing fee or similar tax on a class of health care items or services (or providers of such items or services), the amount of the tax imposed is the same for every provider providing items or services within the class;

(II) in the case of a tax consisting of a licensing fee or similar tax imposed on a class of health care items or services (or providers of such services) on the basis of the number of beds (licensed or otherwise) of the provider, the amount of the tax is the same for each bed of each provider of such items or services in the class;

(III) in the case of a tax based on revenues or receipts with respect to a class of items or services (or providers of items or services) the tax is imposed at a uniform rate for all items and services (or providers of such items or services) in the class on all the gross revenues or receipts, or net operating revenues, relating to the provision of all such items or services (or all such providers) in the State (or, in the case of a tax imposed by a unit of local government within the State, in the area over which the unit has jurisdiction); or

(IV) in the case of any other tax, the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the tax is imposed uniformly.

(ii) Subject to subparagraphs (D) and (E), a tax imposed with respect to a class of health care items and services is not considered to be imposed uniformly if the tax provides for any credits, exclusions, or deductions which have as their purpose or effect the return to providers of all or a portion of the tax paid in a manner that is inconsistent with subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (E)(ii) or provides for a hold harmless provision described in paragraph (4).
