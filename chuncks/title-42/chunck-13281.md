##### (b) Recruitment and placement procedures for local and national placement of volunteers; establishment, requirements, etc.
######## (B) Such volunteer placement office shall develop, operate, and maintain a current and comprehensive database that provides information

(i) to individuals, with respect to specific opportunities for service as a volunteer with approved projects or programs to which no volunteer has been assigned; and

(ii) to approved projects or programs, with respect to the availability of individuals whose applications for service as a volunteer have been approved and who are awaiting an assignment with a specific project or program.

(C) The Director shall assign or hire as necessary, such additional national, regional, and State personnel to carry out the functions described in this subsection and subsection (c) as may be necessary to ensure that such functions are carried out in a timely and effective manner. The Director shall give priority in the hiring of such additional personnel to individuals who have formerly served as volunteers under this part and to individuals who have specialized experience in the recruitment and management of volunteers.

(3) Volunteers shall be selected from among qualified individuals submitting an application for such service at such time, in such form, and containing such information as may be necessary to evaluate the suitability of each individual for such service and to determine, in accordance with paragraph (7), 1 the most appropriate assignment for each such volunteer. The Director shall approve the application of each individual who applies in conformance with this subsection and who, on the basis of the information provided in the application, is determined by the Director to be qualified to serve as a volunteer under this part.

(4) The Director shall ensure that applications for service as a volunteer under this part are available to the public on request to the Corporation (including any State or regional offices of the Agency)  2 and that an individual making such request is informed of the manner in which such application is required to be submitted. A completed application may be submitted by any interested individual to, and shall be accepted by, any office of the Corporation.

(5)

(A) The Director shall provide for the assignment of each applicant approved as a volunteer under this part to a project or program that is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the abilities, experiences, and preferences of such applicant that are set forth in the application described in paragraph (4) and the needs and preferences of projects or programs approved for the assignment of such volunteers.

(B) In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Director shall utilize the database established under paragraph (2)(B).

(C) A sponsoring organization of VISTA may recruit volunteers for service under this part. The Director shall give a locally recruited volunteer priority for placement in the sponsoring organization of VISTA that recruited such volunteer.

(D) A volunteer under this part shall not be assigned to any project or program without the express approval and consent of such project or program.

(E) If an applicant under this part who is recruited locally becomes unavailable for service prior to the commencement of service, the recipient of the project grant or contract that was designated to receive the services of such applicant may replace such applicant with another qualified applicant approved by the Director.

(F) If feasible and appropriate, low-income community volunteers shall be given the option of serving in the home communities of such volunteers in teams with nationally recruited specialist volunteers. The Director shall attempt to assign such volunteers to serve in the home or nearby communities of such volunteers and shall make national efforts to attract other individuals to serve in the VISTA program. The Director shall also, in the assignment of volunteers under this subparagraph, recognize that community-identified needs that cannot be met in the local area and the individual desires of VISTA volunteers in regard to the service in various geographical areas of the United States should be taken into consideration.
