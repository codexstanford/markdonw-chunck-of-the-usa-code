#### § 1101. Employment security administration account
##### (f) Determination of excess in Account; limitation on amount to be retained; use of balance in Account during certain fiscal years; net balance

(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine as of the close of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1961 ) the excess in the employment security administration account.

(2) The excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year is the amount by which the net balance in such account as of such time (after the application of section 1102(b) of this title and paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection) exceeds the net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of that fiscal year (including the fiscal year for which the excess is being computed) for which the net balance was higher than as of the beginning of any other such fiscal year.

(3)

(A) The excess determined as provided in paragraph (2) as of the close of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972 , shall be retained (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) in the employment security administration account until the amount in such account is equal to 40 percent of the amount of the total appropriation by the Congress out of the employment security administration account for the fiscal year for which the excess is determined. Three-eighths of the amount in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972 , or $150 million, whichever is the lesser, is authorized to be made available for such fiscal year pursuant to subsection (c)(1) for additional costs of administration due to an increase in the rate of insured unemployment for a calendar quarter of at least 15 percent over the rate of insured unemployment for the corresponding calendar quarter in the immediately preceding year.

(B) If the entire amount of the excess determined as provided in paragraph (2) as of the close of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972 , is not retained in the employment security administration account, there shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the extended unemployment compensation account the balance of such excess or so much thereof as is required to increase the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account to the limit provided in section 1105(b)(2) of this title .

(C) If as of the close of any fiscal year after June 30, 1972 , the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account exceeds the limit provided in section 1105(b)(2) of this title , such excess shall be transferred to the employment security administration account as of the close of such fiscal year.

(4) For the purposes of this section, the net balance in the employment security administration account as of any time is the amount in such account as of such time reduced by the sum of

(A) the amounts then subject to transfer pursuant to subsection (d), and

(B) the balance of advances (plus interest accrued thereon) then repayable to the revolving fund established by subsection (e). The net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year shall be determined after the disposition of the excess in such account as of the close of the preceding fiscal year.
