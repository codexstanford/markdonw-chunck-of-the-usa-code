#### § 1397ll. Optional coverage of targeted low-income pregnant women through a State plan amendment
##### (f) States providing assistance through other options

(1) Continuation of other options for providing assistance

The option to provide assistance in accordance with the preceding subsections of this section shall not limit any other option for a State to provide

(A) child health assistance through the application of sections 457.10, 457.350(b)(2), 457.622(c)(5), and 457.626(a)(3) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect after the final rule adopted by the Secretary and set forth at 67 Fed. Reg. 61956–61974 ( October 2, 2002 )), or

(B) pregnancy-related services through the application of any waiver authority (as in effect on June 1, 2008 ).

(2) Clarification of authority to provide postpartum services

Any State that provides child health assistance under any authority described in paragraph (1) may continue to provide such assistance, as well as postpartum services, through the end of the month in which the 60-day period (beginning on the last day of the pregnancy) ends, in the same manner as such assistance and postpartum services would be provided if provided under the State plan under subchapter XIX, but only if the mother would otherwise satisfy the eligibility requirements that apply under the State child health plan (other than with respect to age) during such period.

(3) No inference

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed

(A) to infer congressional intent regarding the legality or illegality of the content of the sections specified in paragraph (1)(A); or

(B) to modify the authority to provide pregnancy-related services under a waiver specified in paragraph (1)(B).
