(2) Subject to paragraph (3), at the end of each three-month period occurring during the program year, the Secretary shall pay to each participating neighborhood development organization the product of

(A) the aggregate amount of voluntary contributions that such organization certifies to the satisfaction of the Secretary it received during such three-month period; and

(B) the matching ratio established for such test neighborhoods under paragraph (4).

(3) The Secretary shall pay not more than $50,000 under this section to any participating neighborhood development organization during a single program year, except that, if appropriations for this section exceed $3,000,000, the Secretary may pay not more than $75,000 to any participating neighborhood development organization.

(4) For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, for each participating organization, determine an appropriate ratio by which monetary contributions made to participating neighborhood development organizations will be matched by Federal funds.

(B) eligible neighborhood development activities comply with all applicable provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.].

(6) To carry out this section, the Secretary

(A) may issue regulations as necessary;
