#### § 7424. Assurance of adequacy of State plans
##### (a) State review of implementation plans which relate to major fuel burning sources

As expeditiously as practicable but not later than one year after August 7, 1977 , each State shall review the provisions of its implementation plan which relate to major fuel burning sources and shall determine

(1) the extent to which compliance with requirements of such plan is dependent upon the use by major fuel burning stationary sources of petroleum products or natural gas,

(2) the extent to which such plan may reasonably be anticipated to be inadequate to meet the requirements of this chapter in such State on a reliable and long-term basis by reason of its dependence upon the use of such fuels, and

(3) the extent to which compliance with the requirements of such plan is dependent upon use of coal or coal derivatives which is not locally or regionally available. Each State shall submit the results of its review and its determination under this paragraph to the Administrator promptly upon completion thereof.
