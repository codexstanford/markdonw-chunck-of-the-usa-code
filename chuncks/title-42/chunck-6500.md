#### § 1320a–1. Limitation on use of Federal funds for capital expenditures
##### (e) Treatment of lease or comparable arrangement of any facility or equipment for a facility in determining amount of exclusions from Federal payments

Where a person obtains under lease or comparable arrangement any facility or part thereof, or equipment for a facility, which would have been subject to an exclusion under subsection (d) if the person had acquired it by purchase, the Secretary shall (1) in computing such person’s rental expense in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX with respect to services furnished in such facility, deduct the amount which in his judgment is a reasonable equivalent of the amount that would have been excluded if the person had acquired such facility or such equipment by purchase, and (2) in computing such person’s return on equity capital deduct any amount deposited under the terms of the lease or comparable arrangement.
