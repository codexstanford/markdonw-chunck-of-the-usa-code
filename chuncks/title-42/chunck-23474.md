(I) the delivered generation resource mix for each load-serving entity; and

(II) the distributed energy resources operating within each service area of a load-serving entity;

(ii) harmonize the data on delivered generation resource mix described in clause (i)(I) with measurements of greenhouse gas emissions collected by the Environmental Protection Agency;

(B) Data on the delivered generation resource mix

In collecting the data described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I), the Administrator shall

(ii) consider that generation and transmission entities may provide data on behalf of load-serving entities;

(iii) to the extent that the Administrator determines necessary, and in a manner designed to protect confidential information, require each load-serving entity to submit additional information as needed to determine the delivered generation resource mix of the load-serving entity, including financial or contractual agreements for power and generation resource type attributes with respect to power owned by or retired by the load-serving entity; and
