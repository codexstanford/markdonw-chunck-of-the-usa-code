Non-Federal contributions required in paragraph (1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services.

(i) In making a determination of the amount of non-Federal contributions made by a State for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, subject to clause (ii), include any non-Federal contributions provided by the State for HIV-related services, without regard to whether the contributions are made for programs established pursuant to this subchapter;

(ii) In making a determination for purposes of clause (i), the Secretary may not include any non-Federal contributions provided by the State as a condition of receiving Federal funds under any program under this subchapter (except for the program established in section 300ff–21 of this title ) or under other provisions of law.

(3) Applicability of requirement

(A) Number of cases

A State referred to in paragraph (1) is any State for which the number of cases of HIV/AIDS reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the period described in subparagraph (B) constitutes in excess of 1 percent of the aggregate number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director for such period for the United States.

(4) Diminished State contribution

With respect to a State that does not make available the entire amount of the non-Federal contribution referred to in paragraph (1), the State shall continue to be eligible to receive Federal funds under a grant under section 300ff–21 of this title , except that the Secretary in providing Federal funds under the grant shall provide such funds (in accordance with the ratios prescribed in paragraph (1)) only with respect to the amount of funds contributed by such State.
