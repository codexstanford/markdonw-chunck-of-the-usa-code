(A) in all cases being enforced by the State pursuant to section 654(4) of this title ; and

(B) in all cases not being enforced by the State under this part in which the support order is initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994 , and in which the income of the noncustodial parent is subject to withholding pursuant to section 666(a)(8)(B) of this title .

(2) Operation

The State disbursement unit shall be operated

(B) except in cases described in paragraph (1)(B), in coordination with the automated system established by the State pursuant to section 654a of this title .
