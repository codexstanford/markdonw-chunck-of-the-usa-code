Such notice shall specify the manner in which the entity has not complied with such assurances and direct that the entity initiate (within 30 days of the date the notice is issued by the Secretary or within such longer period as the Secretary determines is reasonable) such action as may be necessary to bring (within such period as the Secretary shall prescribe) the entity into compliance with the assurances. If the entity fails to initiate corrective action within the period prescribed by the notice or fails to comply with the assurances within such period as the Secretary prescribes, then after the Secretary provides the entity a reasonable opportunity for reconsideration of his determination, including, at the entity’s election, a fair hearing (A) the entity shall not be a qualified health maintenance organization for purposes of section 300e–9 of this title until such date as the Secretary determines that it is in compliance with the assurances, and (B) each employer which has offered membership in the entity in compliance with section 300e–9 of this title , each lawfully recognized collective bargaining representative or other employee representative which represents the employees of each such employer, and the members of such entity shall be notified by the entity that the entity is not a qualified health maintenance organization for purposes of such section. The notice required by clause (B) of the preceding sentence shall contain, in readily understandable language, the reasons for the determination that the entity is not a qualified health maintenance organization. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register each determination referred to in this paragraph.

(2) If the Secretary makes, with respect to an entity which has received a grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee under this subchapter, a determination described in subsection (a), the Secretary may, in addition to any other remedies available to him, bring a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which such entity is located to enforce its compliance with the assurances it furnished respecting the provision of basic and supplemental health services or its organization or operation, as the case may be, which assurances were made in connection with its application under this subchapter for the grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.
