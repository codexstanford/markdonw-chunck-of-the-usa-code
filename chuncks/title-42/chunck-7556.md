(1) In general

For purposes of enabling MA organizations that offer MA regional plans to meet applicable provider access requirements under section 1395w–22 of this title with respect to such plans, the Secretary may provide for payment under this section to an essential hospital that provides inpatient hospital services to enrollees in such a plan where the MA organization offering the plan certifies to the Secretary that the organization was unable to reach an agreement between the hospital and the organization regarding provision of such services under the plan. Such payment shall be available only if

(A) the organization provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the organization will make payment to the hospital for inpatient hospital services of an amount that is not less than the amount that would be payable to the hospital under section 1395ww of this title with respect to such services; and

(B) with respect to specific inpatient hospital services provided to an enrollee, the hospital demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the hospital’s costs of such services exceed the payment amount described in subparagraph (A).

(2) Payment amounts

The payment amount under this subsection for inpatient hospital services provided by a subsection (d) hospital to an enrollee in an MA regional plan shall be, subject to the limitation of funds under paragraph (3), the amount (if any) by which

(A) the amount of payment that would have been paid for such services under this subchapter if the enrollees were covered under the original medicare fee-for-service program option and the hospital were a critical access hospital; exceeds

(B) the amount of payment made for such services under paragraph (1)(A).

(3) Available amounts

There shall be available for payments under this subsection

(A) in 2006, $25,000,000; and

(B) in each succeeding year the amount specified in this paragraph for the preceding year increased by the market basket percentage increase (as defined in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title ) for the fiscal year ending in such succeeding year. Payments under this subsection shall be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.

(4) Essential hospital

In this subsection, the term “essential hospital” means, with respect to an MA regional plan offered by an MA organization, a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(d) of this title ) that the Secretary determines, based upon an application filed by the organization with the Secretary, is necessary to meet the requirements referred to in paragraph (1) for such plan.
