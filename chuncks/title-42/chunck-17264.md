#### § 8401. Assistance to areas impacted by increased coal or uranium production
##### (d) General requirements regarding assistance

(1) Assistance under this section shall be provided only upon application, which application shall contain such information as the Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe.

(2) The Secretary of Agriculture may make any grant under this section in whole or in part to the local government or governments serving an area designated and approved under subsection (a), or to a council of local governments which includes one or more local governments serving such area (in lieu of making such grant solely to the State), if he has determined, after consultation with the Governor of the State, that to do so would be appropriate.

(3) The Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe, by rule, criteria for the allocation of assistance under this section. Such criteria shall give due weight to the magnitude of the employment increase involved, the financial resources of the designated area, and the ratio of the financial burden on the area to the resources available to such area.

(4) Assistance under this section shall be provide only if the Secretary of Agriculture is satisfied that

(A) the amounts expended by the State and the local governments involved for the same purposes for which such assistance is provided will not be reduced; and

(B) the amount of such assistance does not reflect any amount for which other Federal financial assistance is provided or on proper application would be provided.
