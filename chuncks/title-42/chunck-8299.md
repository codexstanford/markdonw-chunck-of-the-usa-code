### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396a. State plans for medical assistance
##### (cc) Disabled children eligible to receive medical assistance at option of State
######## (A) If an employer of a parent of an individual described in paragraph (1) offers family coverage under a group health plan (as defined in section 2791(a) of the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 300gg–91(a) ]), the State shall

(i) notwithstanding section 1396e of this title , require such parent to apply for, enroll in, and pay premiums for such coverage as a condition of such parent’s child being or remaining eligible for medical assistance under subsection (a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX) if the parent is determined eligible for such coverage and the employer contributes at least 50 percent of the total cost of annual premiums for such coverage; and

(ii) if such coverage is obtained

(I) subject to paragraph (2) of section 1396 o (h)  17 of this title, reduce the premium imposed by the State under that section in an amount that reasonably reflects the premium contribution made by the parent for private coverage on behalf of a child with a disability; and

(II) treat such coverage as a third party liability under subsection (a)(25).

(B) In the case of a parent to which subparagraph (A) applies, a State, notwithstanding section 1396e of this title but subject to paragraph (1)(C)(ii), may provide for payment of any portion of the annual premium for such family coverage that the parent is required to pay. Any payments made by the State under this subparagraph shall be considered, for purposes of section 1396b(a) of this title , to be payments for medical assistance.
