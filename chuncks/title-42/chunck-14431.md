#### § 6294. Labeling
##### (c) Content of label

(1) Subject to paragraph (6), a rule prescribed under this section shall require that each covered product in the type or class of covered products to which the rule applies bear a label which discloses

(A) the estimated annual operating cost of such product (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title ), except that if

(i) the Secretary determines that disclosure of estimated annual operating cost is not technologically feasible, or

(ii) the Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or is not economically feasible, the Commission shall require disclosure of a different useful measure of energy consumption (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title ); and

(B) information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs for covered products to which the rule applies; except that if the Commission requires disclosure under subparagraph (A) of a measure of energy consumption different from estimated annual operating cost, then the label shall disclose the range of such measure of energy consumption of covered products to which such rule applies.

(2) A rule under this section shall include the following:

(A) A description of the type or class of covered products to which such rule applies.

(B) Subject to paragraph (6), information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs or other useful measure of energy consumption (determined in such manner as the rule may prescribe) for such type or class of covered products.

(C) A description of the test procedures under section 6293 of this title used in determining the estimated annual operating costs or other measure of energy consumption of the type or class of covered products.

(D) A prototype label and directions for displaying such label.

(3) A rule under this section shall require that the label be displayed in a manner that the Commission determines is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and is appropriate to carry out this part. The Commission may permit a tag to be used in lieu of a label in any case in which the Commission finds that a tag will carry out the purposes for which the label was intended.

(4) A rule under this section applicable to a covered product may require disclosure, in any printed matter displayed or distributed at the point of sale of such product, of any information which may be required under this section to be disclosed on the label of such product. Requirements under this paragraph shall not apply to any broadcast advertisement or any advertisement in any newspaper, magazine, or other periodical.

(5) The Commission may require that a manufacturer of a covered product to which a rule under this section applies

(A) include on the label,

(B) separately attach to the product, or

(C) ship with the product, additional information relating to energy consumption, including instructions for the maintenance, use, or repair of the covered product, if the Commission determines that such additional information would assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or in using such product, and that such requirement would not be unduly burdensome to manufacturers.

(6) The Commission may delay the effective date of the requirement specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection applicable to a type or class of covered product, insofar as it requires the disclosure on the label of information respecting range of a measure of energy consumption, for not more than 12 months after the date on which the rule under this section is first applicable to such type or class, if the Commission determines that such information will not be available within an adequate period of time before such date.

(7) Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this subsection shall not apply to the covered product specified in paragraphs (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), and (18) of section 6292(a) of this title .

(8) If a manufacturer of a covered product specified in paragraph (15) or (17) of section 6292(a) of this title elects to provide a label for such covered product conveying the estimated annual operating cost of such product or the range of estimated annual operating costs for the type or class of such product

(A) such estimated cost or range of costs shall be determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title ;

(B) the format of such label shall be in accordance with a format prescribed by the Commission; and

(C) such label shall be displayed in a manner, prescribed by the Commission, to be likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

(9) Discretionary application .

The Commission may apply paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this subsection to the labeling of any product covered by paragraph (2)(I) or (6) of subsection (a).
