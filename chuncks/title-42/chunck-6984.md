#### § 1382i. Medical and social services for certain handicapped persons
##### (c) Requisite features of State plans

In order to participate in the pilot program and be eligible to receive payments for any period under subsection (d), a State (during such period) must have a plan, approved by the Commissioner of Social Security as meeting the requirements of this section, which provides medical and social services for severely handicapped individuals whose earnings are above the level which ordinarily demonstrates an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity and who are not receiving benefits under section 1382 or 1382h of this title or assistance under a State plan approved under section 1396a of this title , and which

(1) declares the intent of the State to participate in the pilot program;

(2) designates an appropriate State agency to administer or supervise the administration of the program in the State;

(3) describes the criteria to be applied by the State in determining the eligibility of any individual for assistance under the plan and in any event requires a determination by the State agency to the effect that (A) such individual’s ability to continue his employment would be significantly inhibited without such assistance and (B) such individual’s earnings are not sufficient to allow him to provide for himself a reasonable equivalent of the cash and other benefits that would be available to him under this subchapter and subchapters XIX and XX in the absence of those earnings;

(4) describes the process by which the eligibility of individuals for such assistance is to be determined (and such process may not involve the performance of functions by any State agency or entity which is engaged in making determinations of disability for purposes of disability insurance or supplemental security income benefits except when the use of a different agency or entity to perform those functions would not be feasible);

(5) describes the medical and social services to be provided under the plan;

(6) describes the manner in which the medical and social services involved are to be provided and, if they are not to be provided through the State’s medical assistance and social services programs under subchapters XIX and XX (with the Federal payments being made under subsection (d) of this section rather than under those subchapters), specifies the particular mechanisms and procedures to be used in providing such services; and

(7) contains such other provisions as the Commissioner of Social Security may find to be necessary or appropriate to meet the requirements of this section or otherwise carry out its purpose.
