#### § 1395w–102. Prescription drug benefits
##### (d) Access to negotiated prices

(1) Access

(A) In general

Under qualified prescription drug coverage offered by a PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan or an MA organization offering an MA–PD plan, the sponsor or organization shall provide enrollees with access to negotiated prices used for payment for covered part D drugs, regardless of the fact that no benefits may be payable under the coverage with respect to such drugs because of the application of a deductible or other cost-sharing or, for a year preceding 2025, an initial coverage limit (described in subsection (b)(3)).

(B) Negotiated prices

For purposes of this part, negotiated prices, subject to subparagraph (D), shall take into account negotiated price concessions, such as discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect remunerations, for covered part D drugs, and include any dispensing fees for such drugs.

(C) Medicaid-related provisions

The prices negotiated by a prescription drug plan, by an MA–PD plan with respect to covered part D drugs, or by a qualified retiree prescription drug plan (as defined in section 1395w–132(a)(2) of this title ) with respect to such drugs on behalf of part D eligible individuals, shall (notwithstanding any other provision of law) not be taken into account for the purposes of establishing the best price under section 1396r–8(c)(1)(C) of this title .

(D) Application of maximum fair price for selected drugs

In applying this section, in the case of a covered part D drug that is a selected drug (as referred to in section 1320f–1(c) of this title ), with respect to a price applicability period (as defined in section 1320f(b)(2) of this title ), the negotiated prices used for payment (as described in this subsection) shall be no greater than the maximum fair price (as defined in section 1320f(c)(3) of this title ) for such drug and for each year during such period plus any dispensing fees for such drug.

(2) Disclosure

A PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan or an MA organization offering an MA–PD plan shall disclose to the Secretary (in a manner specified by the Secretary) the aggregate negotiated price concessions described in paragraph (1)(B) made available to the sponsor or organization by a manufacturer which are passed through in the form of lower subsidies, lower monthly beneficiary prescription drug premiums, and lower prices through pharmacies and other dispensers. The provisions of section 1396r–8(b)(3)(D) of this title apply to information disclosed to the Secretary under this paragraph.

(3) Audits

To protect against fraud and abuse and to ensure proper disclosures and accounting under this part and in accordance with section 1395w–27(d)(2)(B) of this title (as applied under section 1395w–112(b)(3)(C) of this title ), the Secretary may conduct periodic audits, directly or through contracts, of the financial statements and records of PDP sponsors with respect to prescription drug plans and MA organizations with respect to MA–PD plans.
