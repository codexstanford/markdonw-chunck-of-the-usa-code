##### (q) Qualified severely impaired individual

The term “qualified severely impaired individual” means an individual under age 65

(1) who for the month preceding the first month to which this subsection applies to such individual

(A) received (i) a payment of supplemental security income benefits under section 1382(b) of this title on the basis of blindness or disability, (ii) a supplementary payment under section 1382e of this title or under section 212 of Public Law 93–66 on such basis, (iii) a payment of monthly benefits under section 1382h(a) of this title , or (iv) a supplementary payment under section 1382e(c)(3), and

(B) was eligible for medical assistance under the State plan approved under this subchapter; and

(2) with respect to whom the Commissioner of Social Security determines that

(A) the individual continues to be blind or continues to have the disabling physical or mental impairment on the basis of which he was found to be under a disability and, except for his earnings, continues to meet all non-disability-related requirements for eligibility for benefits under subchapter XVI,

(B) the income of such individual would not, except for his earnings, be equal to or in excess of the amount which would cause him to be ineligible for payments under section 1382(b) of this title (if he were otherwise eligible for such payments),

(C) the lack of eligibility for benefits under this subchapter would seriously inhibit his ability to continue or obtain employment, and

(D) the individual’s earnings are not sufficient to allow him to provide for himself a reasonable equivalent of the benefits under subchapter XVI (including any federally administered State supplementary payments), this subchapter, and publicly funded attendant care services (including personal care assistance) that would be available to him in the absence of such earnings. In the case of an individual who is eligible for medical assistance pursuant to section 1382h(b) of this title in June, 1987, the individual shall be a qualified severely impaired individual for so long as such individual meets the requirements of paragraph (2).
