### CHAPTER 163— RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COMPETITION, AND INNOVATION
#### § 18911. Basic energy sciences program
##### (f) Carbon Sequestration Research and Geologic Computational Science Initiative

(1) Initiative

(A) In general

The Secretary of Energy (referred to in this subsection as the “Secretary”) shall establish a research initiative, to be known as the “Carbon Sequestration Research and Geologic Computational Science Initiative” (referred to in this subsection as the “Initiative”), to expand the fundamental knowledge, data collection, data analysis, and modeling of subsurface geology for the purpose of advancing carbon sequestration in geologic formations.

(B) Leveraging

In carrying out programs and activities under the Initiative, the Secretary shall leverage expertise and resources from the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and the United States Geological Survey.

(C) Teams

(i) In general

In carrying out the Initiative, the Secretary shall establish and organize activities among multidisciplinary teams to leverage, to the maximum extent practicable, expertise from the National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and the private sector.

(ii) Goals

The multidisciplinary teams described in clause (i) shall pursue aggressive, milestone-driven research goals established by the Secretary.

(D) Additional activities

The Secretary may organize additional activities under this subsection through other organizational structures.

(2) Research program

(A) In general

The Secretary shall carry out under the Initiative a program to support research needed for, and discover knowledge relevant to, the sequestration of carbon in geologic formations.

(B) Activities

As part of the program described in subparagraph (A), the Director of the Office of Science shall support fundamental research to pursue distinct lines of scientific inquiry, including

(i) gathering geologic data for pore space characterization, including improvements to geologic seismic imaging;

(ii) evaluating pore space quality, including evaluation of geologic samples, to determine appropriate sequestration zones for carbon;

(iii) testing carbon sequestration;

(iv) monitoring carbon migration in geologic formations;

(v) advancements in data analytics, including the analysis of seismic data, and computational science to improve the advanced computing, visualization, and imaging of geologic formations for the sequestration of carbon; and

(vi) predictive understanding of coupled processes in complex subsurface geologic systems for secure carbon storage.

(C) Review

The Secretary shall periodically review activities carried out under the program described in subparagraph (A) to evaluate achievement of scientific objectives and research milestones.

(3) Carbon storage research and geologic computational science centers

(A) In general

In carrying out the activities authorized under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall select and establish not more than 2 carbon storage research and geologic computational science centers (referred to in this paragraph as a “Center”) to develop and advance improvements to data collection, analysis, and modeling of subsurface geology for the purpose of advancing carbon sequestration in geologic formations.

(B) Selection

(i) In general

The Secretary shall

(I) select Centers under subparagraph (A) on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis; and

(II) to the maximum extent practicable, locate each Center in a geographically diverse region with established and ongoing geologic carbon sequestration research and demonstration.

(ii) Applications

In selecting Centers under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider applications from institutions of higher education, multi-institutional collaborations, and other appropriate entities.

(C) Duration

(i) New Centers

A Center established after August 9, 2022 , shall receive support for a period of not more than 5 years beginning on the date of establishment of that Center, subject to the availability of appropriations.

(ii) Existing Centers

A Center already in existence on August 9, 2022 , may continue to receive support for a period of not more than 5 years beginning on August 9, 2022 .

(iii) Renewal

On expiration of a period of support described in clause (i) or (ii), the Secretary may renew support for the Center, on a merit-reviewed basis, for a period of not more than 5 years.

(4) Coordination with existing programs and Centers

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall

(A) ensure coordination with

(i) the United States Geological Survey; and

(ii) the programs established under section 16293 of this title ; and

(B) avoid duplication of efforts to the maximum extent practicable.
