### CHAPTER 130— NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING
#### § 12742. Eligible uses of investment
##### (e) Cost limits

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish limits on the amount of funds under this part that may be invested on a per unit basis. For multifamily housing, such limits shall not be less than the per unit dollar amount limitations set forth in section 1715 l (d)(3)(ii) of title 12, as such limitations may be adjusted in accordance therewith, except that for purposes of this subsection the Secretary shall, by regulation, increase the per unit dollar amount limitations in any geographical area by an amount, not to exceed 140 percent, that equals the amount by which the costs of multifamily housing construction in the area exceed the national average of such costs. The limits shall be established on a market-by-market basis, with adjustments made for number of bedrooms, and shall reflect the actual cost of new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of housing that meets applicable State and local housing and building codes and the cost of land, including necessary site improvements. Adjustments shall be made annually to reflect inflation. Separate limits may be set for different eligible activities.

(2) Criteria

In calculating per unit limits, the Secretary shall take into account that assistance under this subchapter is intended to

(A) provide nonluxury housing with suitable amenities;

(B) operate effectively in all jurisdictions;

(C) facilitate mixed-income housing; and

(D) reflect the costs associated with meeting the special needs of tenants or homeowners that the housing is designed to serve.

(3) Consultation

In calculating cost limits, the Secretary shall consult with organizations that have expertise in the development of affordable housing, including national nonprofit organizations and national organizations representing private development firms and State and local governments.
