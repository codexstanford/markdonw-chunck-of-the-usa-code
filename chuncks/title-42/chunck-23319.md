### CHAPTER 161— DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
#### § 18645. Fusion energy
##### (o) High-performance computation collaborative research program

(1) In general

The Secretary shall carry out a program to conduct and support collaborative research, development, and demonstration of fusion energy technologies, through high-performance computation modeling and simulation techniques, in order

(A) to support fundamental research in plasmas and matter at very high temperatures and densities;

(B) to inform the development of a broad range of fusion energy systems; and

(C) to facilitate the translation of research results in fusion energy science to industry.

(2) Coordination

In carrying out the program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall coordinate with relevant Federal agencies, and prioritize the following objectives:

(A) To use expertise from the private sector, institutions of higher education, and the National Laboratories to leverage existing, and develop new, computational software and capabilities that prospective users may use to accelerate research and development of fusion energy systems.

(B) To develop computational tools to simulate and predict fusion energy science phenomena that may be validated through physical experimentation.

(C) To increase the utility of the research infrastructure of the Department by coordinating with the Advanced Scientific Computing Research program within the Office of Science.

(D) To leverage experience from existing modeling and simulation entities sponsored by the Department.

(E) To ensure that new experimental and computational tools are accessible to relevant research communities, including private sector entities engaged in fusion energy technology development.

(F) To ensure that newly developed computational tools are compatible with modern virtual engineering and visualization capabilities to accelerate the realization of fusion energy technologies and systems.

(3) Duplication

The Secretary shall ensure the coordination of, and avoid unnecessary duplication of, the activities of the program under paragraph (1) with the activities of

(A) other research entities of the Department, including the National Laboratories, the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy, and the Advanced Scientific Computing Research program within the Office of Science; and

(B) industry.

(4) High-Performance Computing for Fusion Innovation Center

(A) In general

In carrying out the program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, in coordination with the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy, establish and operate a national High-Performance Computing for Fusion Innovation Center (referred to in this paragraph as the “Center”), to support the program under paragraph (1) by providing, to the extent practicable, a centralized entity for multidisciplinary, collaborative, fusion energy research and development through high-performance computing and advanced data analytics technologies and processes.

(B) Eligible entities

An entity eligible to serve as the Center shall be

(i) a National Laboratory;

(ii) an institution of higher education;

(iii) a multi-institutional collaboration; or

(iv) any other entity that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(C) Application; selection

(i) Application

To be eligible to serve as the Center, an eligible entity shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.

(ii) Selection

The Secretary shall select the Center on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis.

(D) Existing activities

The Center may incorporate existing research activities that are consistent with the program under paragraph (1).

(E) Priorities

(i) In general

The Center shall prioritize activities that utilize expertise and infrastructure from a balance among the private sector, institutions of higher education, and the National Laboratories to enhance existing computation tools and develop new computational software and capabilities to accelerate the commercial application of fusion energy systems.

(ii) Maintenance of resource availability

The Secretary may enter into contracts with commercial cloud computing providers to ensure that resource availability within the Department is not reduced or disproportionately distributed as a result of Center activities.

(F) Duration

Subject to subparagraph (G), the Center shall receive support for a period of not more than 5 years, subject to the availability of appropriations.

(G) Renewal

On the expiration of the period of support of the Center under subparagraph (F), the Secretary may renew support for the Center, on a merit-reviewed basis, for a period of not more than 5 years.
