#### § 415. Computation of primary insurance amount
##### (f) Recomputation of benefits
######## (D) A recomputation under this paragraph with respect to any year shall be effective

(i) in the case of an individual who did not die in that year, for monthly benefits beginning with benefits for January of the following year; or

(ii) in the case of an individual who died in that year, for monthly benefits beginning with benefits for the month in which he died.

(3) Repealed. Pub. L. 95–216, title II, § 201(f)(2) , Dec. 20, 1977 , 91 Stat. 1521 .

(4) A recomputation shall be effective under this subsection only if it increases the primary insurance amount by at least $1.

(5) In the case of a man who became entitled to old-age insurance benefits and died before the month in which he attained retirement age (as defined in section 416( l ) of this title), the Commissioner of Social Security shall recompute his primary insurance amount as provided in subsection (a) as though he became entitled to old-age insurance benefits in the month in which he died; except that (i) his computation base years referred to in subsection (b)(2) shall include the year in which he died, and (ii) his elapsed years referred to in subsection (b)(3) shall not include the year in which he died or any year thereafter. Such recomputation of such primary insurance amount shall be effective for and after the month in which he died.

(6) Upon the death after 1967 of an individual entitled to benefits under section 402(a) or section 423 of this title , if any person is entitled to monthly benefits or a lump-sum death payment, on the wages and self-employment income of such individual, the Commissioner of Social Security shall recompute the decedent’s primary insurance amount, but only if the decedent during his lifetime was paid compensation which was treated under section 405( o ) of this title as remuneration for employment.

(7) This subsection as in effect in December 1978 shall continue to apply to the recomputation of a primary insurance amount computed under subsection (a) or (d) as in effect (without regard to the table in subsection (a)) in that month, and, where appropriate, under subsection (d) as in effect in December 1977, including a primary insurance amount computed under any such subsection whose operation is modified as a result of the amendments made by section 5117 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. For purposes of recomputing a primary insurance amount determined under subsection (a) or (d) (as so in effect) in the case of an individual to whom those subsections apply by reason of subsection (a)(4)(B) as in effect after December 1978, no remuneration shall be taken into account for the year in which the individual initially became eligible for an old-age or disability insurance benefit or died, or for any year thereafter, and (effective January 1982) the recomputation shall be modified by the application of subsection (a)(6) where applicable.

(8) The Commissioner of Social Security shall recompute the primary insurance amounts applicable to beneficiaries whose benefits are based on a primary insurance amount which was computed under subsection (a)(3) effective prior to January 1979, or would have been so computed if the dollar amount specified therein were $11.50. Such recomputation shall be effective January 1979, and shall include the effect of the increase in the dollar amount provided by subsection (a)(1)(C)(i). Such primary insurance amount shall be deemed to be provided under such section for purposes of subsection (i).

(9)

(A) In the case of an individual who becomes entitled to a periodic payment determined under subsection (a)(7)(A) (including a payment determined under subsection (a)(7)(C)) in a month subsequent to the first month in which he or she becomes entitled to an old-age or disability insurance benefit, and whose primary insurance amount has been computed without regard to either such subsection or subsection (d)(3), such individual’s primary insurance amount shall be recomputed (notwithstanding paragraph (4)), in accordance with either such subsection or subsection (d)(3), as may be applicable, effective with the first month of his or her concurrent entitlement to such benefit and such periodic payment.
