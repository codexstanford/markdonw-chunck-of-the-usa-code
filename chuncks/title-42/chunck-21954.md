##### (f) Bioenergy research centers

(1) In general

In carrying out the program under section 18644(a) of this title , the Director shall support up to 6 bioenergy research centers to conduct fundamental research in plant and microbial systems biology, biological imaging and analysis, and genomics, and to accelerate advanced research and development of advanced biofuels, bioenergy or biobased materials, chemicals, and products that are produced from a variety of regionally diverse feedstocks, and to facilitate the translation of research results to industry. The activities of the centers authorized under this subsection may include

(A) accelerating the domestication of bioenergy-relevant plants, microbes, and associated microbial communities to enable high-impact, value-added coproduct development at multiple points in the bioenergy supply chain;

(B) developing the science and technological advances to ensure process sustainability is considered in the creation of advanced biofuels and bioproducts from lignocellulosic biomass; and

(C) using the latest tools in genomics, molecular biology, catalysis science, chemical engineering, systems biology, and computational and robotics technologies to sustainably produce and transform biomass into advanced biofuels and bioproducts.

(2) Selection and duration

(A) In general

A center established under paragraph (1) shall be selected on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis for a period of not more than 5 years, subject to the availability of appropriations, beginning on the date of establishment of that center.

(B) Applications

The Director shall consider applications from National Laboratories, multi-institutional collaborations, and other appropriate entities.

(C) Existing centers

A center already in existence on August 9, 2022 , may continue to receive support for a period of not more than 5 years beginning on the date of establishment of that center.

(D) New centers

The Director shall select any new center pursuant to paragraph (1) on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, with special consideration for applications from an institution of higher education (as defined in section 1001 of title 20 ) that is located in an eligible jurisdiction (as defined in section 13503(b)(3)(A) of this title ).

(3) Renewal

After the end of the applicable period described in paragraph (2), the Director may renew support for a center for a period of not more than 5 years on a merit-reviewed basis. For a center in operation for 10 years after its previous selection on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, the Director may renew support for the center on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis for a period of not more than 5 years, and may subsequently provide an additional renewal on a merit-reviewed basis for a period of not more than 5 years.

(4) Activities

Centers shall undertake research activities to accelerate the production of advanced biofuels and bioproducts from biomass resources by identifying the most suitable species of plants for use as energy crops; and improving methods of breeding, propagation, planting, producing, harvesting, storage and processing. Activities may include the following:

(A) Research activities to increase sustainability, including

(i) advancing knowledge of how bioenergy crop interactions with biotic and abiotic environmental factors influence crop growth, yield, and quality;

(ii) identifying the most impactful research areas that address the economics of advanced biofuels and bioproducts production; and

(iii) utilizing multiscale modeling to advance predictive understanding of advanced biofuel cropping ecosystems.

(B) Research activities to further feedstock development, including lignocellulosic, algal, gaseous wastes including carbon oxides and methane, and direct air capture of single carbon gases via plants and microbes, including

(i) developing genetic and genomic tools, high-throughput analytical tools, and biosystems design approaches to enhance bioenergy feedstocks and their associated microbiomes;

(ii) conducting field testing of new potential bioenergy feedstock crops under environmentally benign and geographically diverse conditions to assess viability and robustness; and

(iii) developing quantitative models informed by experimentation to predict how bioenergy feedstocks perform under diverse conditions.

(C) Research activities to improve lignocellulosic deconstruction and separation methods, including

(i) developing feedstock-agnostic deconstruction processes capable of efficiently fractionating biomass into targeted output streams;

(ii) gaining a detailed understanding of plant cell wall biosynthesis, composition, structure, and properties during deconstruction; and

(iii) improving enzymes and approaches for biomass breakdown and cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin processing.

(D) Research activities to improve the feedstock conversion process for advanced biofuels and bioproducts, including

(i) developing high-throughput methods to screen or select high-performance microbial strains and communities to improve product formation rates, yields, and selectivity;

(ii) establishing a broad set of platform microorganisms and microbial communities suitable for metabolic engineering to produce advanced biofuels and bioproducts and high-throughput methods for experimental validation of gene function;

(iii) developing techniques to enhance microbial robustness for tolerating toxins to improve advanced biofuel and bioproduct yields and to gain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular bases of tolerance for major chemical classes of inhibitors found in these processes;

(iv) advancing technologies for the use of batch, continuous, and consolidated bioprocessing;

(v) identifying, creating, and optimizing microbial and chemical pathways to produce promising, atom-economical intermediates and final bioproducts from biomass with considerations given to environmentally benign processes;

(vi) developing high-throughput, real-time, in situ analytical techniques to understand and characterize the pre- and post-bioproduct separation streams in detail;

(vii) creating methodologies for efficiently identifying viable target molecules, identifying high-value bioproducts in existing biomass streams, and utilizing current byproduct streams;

(viii) identifying and improving plant feedstocks with enhanced extractable levels of desired bioproducts or bioproduct precursors, including lignin streams; and

(ix) developing integrated biological and chemical catalytic approaches to valorize and produce a diverse portfolio of advanced biofuels and bioproducts.

(5) Industry partnerships

Centers shall establish industry partnerships to translate research results to commercial applications.

(6) Coordination

In coordination with the Bioenergy Technologies Office of the Department, the Secretary shall support interdisciplinary research activities to improve the capacity, efficiency, resilience, security, reliability, and affordability, of the production and use of advanced biofuels and bioproducts, as well as activities to enable positive impacts and avoid the potential negative impacts that the production and use of advanced biofuels and bioproducts may have on ecosystems, people, and historically marginalized communities.
