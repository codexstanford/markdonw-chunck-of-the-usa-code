#### § 5306. Allocation and distribution of funds
##### (b) Computation of amount allocated to metropolitan cities and urban counties
######## (A) Where data are available, the amount determined under paragraph (1) for a metropolitan city that has been formed by the consolidation of one or more metropolitan cities with an urban county shall be equal to the sum of the amounts that would have been determined under paragraph (1) for the metropolitan city or cities and the balance of the consolidated government, if such consolidation had not occurred. This paragraph shall apply only to any consolidation that

(i) included all metropolitan cities that received grants under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation and that were located within the urban county;

(ii) included the entire urban county that received a grant under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation; and

(iii) took place on or after January 1, 1983 .

(B) The population growth rate of all metropolitan cities referred to in section 5302(a)(12) of this title shall be based on the population of (i) metropolitan cities other than consolidated governments the grant for which is determined under this paragraph; and (ii) cities that were metropolitan cities before their incorporation into consolidated governments. For purposes of calculating the entitlement share for the balance of the consolidated government under this paragraph, the entire balance shall be considered to have been an urban county.
