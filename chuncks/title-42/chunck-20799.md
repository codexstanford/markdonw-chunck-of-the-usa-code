#### § 13552. Use of energy futures for fuel purchases
##### (a) Fuel study

The Secretary shall conduct a study

(1) to ascertain if the use of energy futures and options contracts could provide cost-effective protection for Government entities (including Government purchases for military purposes and for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) and consumer cooperatives (or any organization whose purpose is to purchase fuel in bulk) from unanticipated surges in the price of fuel; and

(2) to ascertain how such Government entities or consumer cooperatives may be educated in the prudent use of energy futures and options contracts to maximize their purchasing effectiveness, protect themselves against unanticipated surges in the price of fuel, and minimize fuel costs.
