#### § 8833. Guaranteed construction loans
##### (e) Payment to lender

If the Secretary of Energy determines that

(1) the borrower is unable to meet payments and is not in default,

(2) it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of such project, and

(3) the probable net benefit to the United States in paying the principal and interest due under a loan guarantee agreement will be greater than that which would result in the event of a default, then the Secretary may pay to the lender under a loan guarantee agreement an amount not greater than the principal and interest which the borrower is obligated to pay to such lender, if the borrower agrees to reimburse the Secretary for such payment on terms and conditions, including interest, which the Secretary determines are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States.
