##### (a) Establishment

(1) In general

There is established the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.

(2) Program activities

The activities of the Program shall be designed to

(A) develop effective measures for earthquake hazards reduction;

(B) promote the adoption of earthquake hazards reduction measures by Federal, State, and local governments, national standards and model code organizations, architects and engineers, building owners, and others with a role in planning and constructing buildings, structures, and lifeline infrastructure through
