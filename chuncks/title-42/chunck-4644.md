##### (c) Grievance procedures

(1) Federal responsibility

(A) Models

The Secretary shall, through a process that includes consultations with grantees under this subpart and public and private experts in grievance procedures, arbitration, and mediation, develop model grievance procedures that may be implemented by the planning council under subsection (b)(1) and grantees under this subpart. Such model procedures shall describe the elements that must be addressed in establishing local grievance procedures and provide grantees with flexibility in the design of such local procedures.

(B) Review

The Secretary shall review grievance procedures established by the planning council and grantees under this subpart to determine if such procedures are adequate. In making such a determination, the Secretary shall assess whether such procedures permit legitimate grievances to be filed, evaluated, and resolved at the local level.

(2) Grantees

To be eligible to receive funds under this subpart, a grantee shall develop grievance procedures that are determined by the Secretary to be consistent with the model procedures developed under paragraph (1)(A). Such procedures shall include a process for submitting grievances to binding arbitration.
