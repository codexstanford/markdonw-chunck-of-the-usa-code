(1)

(A) The Secretary shall, in consultation with Federal and State regulatory agencies, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, private insurers, and organizations representing consumers and the aged, conduct a comprehensive study and evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of various State approaches to the regulation of medicare supplemental policies in (i) limiting marketing and agent abuse, (ii) assuring the dissemination of such information to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter (and to other consumers) as is necessary to permit informed choice, (iii) promoting policies which provide reasonable economic benefits for such individuals, (iv) reducing the purchase of unnecessary duplicative coverage, (v) improving price competition, and (vi) establishing effective approved State regulatory programs described in subsection (b).

(B) Such study shall also address the need for standards or certification of health insurance policies, other than medicare supplemental policies, sold to individuals eligible for benefits under this subchapter.

(C) The Secretary shall, no later than January 1, 1982 , submit a report to the Congress on the results of such study and evaluation, accompanied by such recommendations as the Secretary finds warranted by such results with respect to the need for legislative or administrative changes to accomplish the objectives set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), including the need for a mandatory Federal regulatory program to assure the marketing of appropriate types of medicare supplemental policies, and such other means as he finds may be appropriate to enhance effective State regulation of such policies.

(2) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress no later than July 1, 1982 , and periodically as may be appropriate thereafter (but not less often than once every 2 years), a report evaluating the effectiveness of the certification procedure and the criminal penalties established under this section, and shall include in such reports an analysis of

(A) the impact of such procedure and penalties on the types, market share, value, and cost to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter of medicare supplemental policies which have been certified by the Secretary;

(B) the need for any change in the certification procedure to improve its administration or effectiveness; and

(C) whether the certification program and criminal penalties should be continued.

(3) The Secretary shall provide information via a toll-free telephone number on medicare supplemental policies (including the relationship of State programs under subchapter XIX to such policies).
