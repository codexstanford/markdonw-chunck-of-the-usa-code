The Secretary shall ensure, as determined appropriate by the Secretary, that no duplicative payments are made under this part or part D for items and services furnished by an opioid treatment program.

In developing such bundles, the Secretary may consider payment rates paid to opioid treatment programs for comparable services under State plans under subchapter XIX or under the TRICARE program under chapter 55 of title 10.
