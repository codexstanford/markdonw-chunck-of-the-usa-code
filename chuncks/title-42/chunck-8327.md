#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (g) Decrease in Federal medical assistance percentage of amounts paid for services furnished under State plan after June 30, 1973
######## (A) No reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under this subsection shall take effect

(i) if such reduction is due to the State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning before January 1, 1977 ;

(ii) before January 1, 1978 ;

(iii) unless a notice of such reduction has been provided to the State at least 30 days before the date such reduction takes effect; or

(iv) due to the State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning after September 30, 1977 , unless notice of such reduction has been provided to the State no later than the first day of the fourth calendar quarter following the calendar quarter with respect to which such showing was made.

(B) The Secretary shall waive application of any reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under paragraph (1) because a showing by the State, made under such paragraph with respect to a calendar quarter ending after January 1, 1977 , and before January 1, 1978 , is determined to be either unsatisfactory under such paragraph or invalid under paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State’s showing made under paragraph (1) with respect to any calendar quarter ending on or before December 31, 1978 , is satisfactory under such paragraph and is valid under paragraph (2).

(4)

(A) The Secretary may not find the showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory if the showing is submitted to the Secretary later than the 30th day after the last day of the calendar quarter, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary good cause for not meeting such deadline.
