(II) has earned income (other than income excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title ) for any month in the 12-month period preceding such month that is equal to or in excess of the amount that would cause him or her to be ineligible for payments under section 1382(b) of this title for that month (if he or she were otherwise eligible for such payments); or

(ii)

(I) on the basis of the same impairment on which his or her eligibility under such section 1382h(b) of this title was based becomes eligible under section 1382h(b) of this title for a month that follows a period during which the individual was ineligible under section 1382 of this title and section 1382h of this title , and

(II) has earned income (other than income excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title ) for such month or for any month in the 12-month period preceding such month that is equal to or in excess of the amount that would cause him or her to be ineligible for payments under section 1382(b) of this title for that month (if he or she were otherwise eligible for such payments); shall, upon becoming eligible (as described in clause (i)(I) or (ii)(I)), be subject to a prompt review of the type described in section 1382c(a)(4) of this title .

(B) If the Commissioner of Social Security determines pursuant to a review required by subparagraph (A) that the impairment upon which the eligibility of an individual is based has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling, such individual may not thereafter become eligible for a benefit under or pursuant to section 1382 of this title or section 1382h of this title until the individual has reapplied for benefits under section 1382 of this title and been determined to be eligible for benefits under such section.
