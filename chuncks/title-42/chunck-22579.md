#### § 17193. General geothermal systems research and development
##### (b) Environmental impacts

The Secretary shall

(1) support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of technologies and practices designed to mitigate or preclude potential adverse environmental impacts of geothermal energy development, production or use;

(2) support a research program to identify potential environmental impacts, including induced seismicity, and environmental benefits of geothermal energy development, production, and use, and ensure that the program described in paragraph (1) addresses such impacts, including water use and effects on groundwater and local hydrology;

(3) support a program of research to compare the potential environmental impacts and environmental benefits identified as part of the development, production, and use of geothermal energy with the potential emission reductions of greenhouse gases gained by geothermal energy development, production, and use; and

(4) in carrying out this section, the Secretary shall, 1 to the maximum extent practicable, consult with relevant federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency.
