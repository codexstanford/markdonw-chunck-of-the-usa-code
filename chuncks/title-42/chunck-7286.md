(1) In general

With respect to services described in section 1395 l (a)(8) or 1395 l (a)(9) of this title for which payment is determined under this subsection, the payment basis shall be

(A) for services furnished during 1998, the amount determined under paragraph (2); or

(B) for services furnished during a subsequent year, 80 percent of the lesser of

(i) the actual charge for the services, or

(ii) the applicable fee schedule amount (as defined in paragraph (3)) for the services.

(2) Payment in 1998 based upon adjusted reasonable costs

The amount under this paragraph for services is the lesser of

(A) the charges imposed for the services, or

(B) the adjusted reasonable costs (as defined in paragraph (4)) for the services, less 20 percent of the amount of the charges imposed for such services.

(3) Applicable fee schedule amount

In this subsection, the term “applicable fee schedule amount” means, with respect to services furnished in a year, the amount determined under the fee schedule established under section 1395w–4 of this title for such services furnished during the year or, if there is no such fee schedule established for such services, the amount determined under the fee schedule established for such comparable services as the Secretary specifies.

(4) Adjusted reasonable costs

In paragraph (2), the term “adjusted reasonable costs” means, with respect to any services, reasonable costs determined for such services, reduced by 10 percent. The 10-percent reduction shall not apply to services described in section 1395 l (a)(8)(B) of this title (relating to services provided by hospitals).

(5) Uniform coding

For claims for services submitted on or after April 1, 1998 , for which the amount of payment is determined under this subsection, the claim shall include a code (or codes) under a uniform coding system specified by the Secretary that identifies the services furnished.

(6) Restraint on billing

The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1395u(b)(18) of this title shall apply to therapy services for which payment is made under this subsection in the same manner as they apply to services provided by a practitioner described in section 1395u(b)(18)(C) of this title .

(7) Adjustment in discount for certain multiple therapy services

In the case of therapy services furnished on or after April 1, 2013 , and for which payment is made under this subsection pursuant to the applicable fee schedule amount (as defined in paragraph (3)), instead of the 25 percent multiple procedure payment reduction specified in the final rule published by the Secretary in the Federal Register on November 29, 2010 , the reduction percentage shall be 50 percent.
