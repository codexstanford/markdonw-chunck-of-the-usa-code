### CHAPTER 8— LOW-INCOME HOUSING
#### § 1437u. Family Self-Sufficiency program
##### (e) Incentives for participation

(1) Maximum rents

During the term of the contract of participation, the amount of rent paid by any participating family shall be calculated under the rental provisions of section 1437a of this title or section 1437f( o ) of this title, as applicable.

(2) Escrow savings accounts

For each participating family, an amount equal to any increase in the amount of rent paid by the family in accordance with the provisions of section 1437a or 1437f( o ) of this title, as applicable, that is attributable to increases in earned income by the participating family, shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account established by the eligible entity on behalf of the participating family. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an eligible entity may use funds it controls under section 1437f or 1437g of this title for purposes of making the escrow deposit for participating families assisted under, or residing in units assisted under, section 1437f or 1437g of this title, respectively, provided such funds are offset by the increase in the amount of rent paid by the participating family. All Family Self-Sufficiency programs administered under this section shall include an escrow account. The Secretary shall not escrow any amounts for any family whose adjusted income exceeds 80 percent of the area median income. Amounts in the escrow account may be withdrawn by the participating family after the family ceases to receive income assistance under Federal or State welfare programs, upon successful performance of the obligations of the family under the contract of participation entered into by the family under subsection (d), as determined according to the specific goals and terms included in the contract, and under other circumstances in which the Secretary determines an exception for good cause is warranted. An eligible entity establishing such escrow accounts may make certain amounts in the accounts available to the participating families before full performance of the contract obligations based on compliance with, and completion of, specific interim goals included in the contract; except that any such amounts shall be used by the participating families for purposes consistent with the contracts of participation, as determined by such eligible entity.

(3) Forfeited escrow

Any amount placed in an escrow account established by an eligible entity for a participating family as required under paragraph (2), that exists after the end of a contract of participation by a household member of a participating family that does not qualify to receive the escrow, shall be used by the eligible entity for the benefit of participating families in good standing.
