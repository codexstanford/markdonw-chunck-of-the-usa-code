(2) gather the production information of these marginal wells and reservoirs;

(3) estimate the remaining producible reserves based on variable pipeline pressures;

(4) locate low-pressure gathering facilities and pipelines;

(5) recommend incentives which will enable the continued production of these resources;

(6) produce maps and literature to disseminate to States to promote conservation of natural gas reserves; and
