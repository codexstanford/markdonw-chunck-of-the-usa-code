#### § 13503. Supporting research and technical analysis
##### (a) Basic energy sciences

(1) Program direction

The Secretary shall continue to support a vigorous program of basic energy sciences to provide basic research support for the development of energy technologies. Such program shall focus on the efficient production and use of energy, and the expansion of our knowledge of materials, chemistry, geology, and other related areas of advancing technology development.

(2) User facilities

(A) As part of the program referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall carry out planning, construction, and operation of user facilities to provide special scientific and research capabilities, including technical expertise and support as appropriate, to serve the research needs of our Nation’s universities, industry, private laboratories, Federal laboratories, and others. Research institutions or individuals from other nations shall be accommodated at such user facilities in cases where reciprocal accommodations are provided to United States research institutions and individuals or where the Secretary considers such accommodation to be in the national interest.

(B) The construction of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory is hereby authorized.

(C) The Secretary shall not change the user fee practice in effect as of October 1, 1991 , with respect to user facilities unless the Secretary notifies Congress 90 days before the effective date of any change.

(D) The Secretary shall expedite the design for construction of the Advanced Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in order to provide critical research capabilities in support of our national research initiatives for advanced materials and biotechnology, as well as a broad range of research. Such action shall be consistent with the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee’s Technical Evaluation of accelerator and reactor neutron source technologies. Within 90 days after October 24, 1992 , the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a plan for such design, including a schedule for construction.

(3) Cost sharing

The Secretary shall not require cost sharing for research and development pursuant to this subsection, except

(A) as otherwise provided for in cooperative research and development agreements or other agreements entered into under existing law;

(B) for fees for user facilities, as determined by the Secretary; or

(C) in the case of specific projects, where the Secretary determines that the benefits of such research and development accrue to a specific industry or group of industries, in which case cost sharing under section 13542 of this title shall apply.
