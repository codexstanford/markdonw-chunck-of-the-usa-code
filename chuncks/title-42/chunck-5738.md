##### (g) Recovery of unemployment benefit payments

(1) A State shall deduct from unemployment benefits otherwise payable to an individual an amount equal to any overpayment made to such individual under an unemployment benefit program of the United States or of any other State, and not previously recovered. The amount so deducted shall be paid to the jurisdiction under whose program such overpayment was made. Any such deduction shall be made only in accordance with the same procedures relating to notice and opportunity for a hearing as apply to the recovery of overpayments of regular unemployment compensation paid by such State.

(2) Any State may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor under which

(A) the State agrees to recover from unemployment benefits otherwise payable to an individual by such State any overpayments made under an unemployment benefit program of the United States to such individual and not previously recovered, in accordance with paragraph (1), and to pay such amounts recovered to the United States for credit to the appropriate account, and

(B) the United States agrees to allow the State to recover from unemployment benefits otherwise payable to an individual under an unemployment benefit program of the United States any overpayments made by such State to such individual under a State unemployment benefit program and not previously recovered, in accordance with the same procedures as apply under paragraph (1).

(3) For purposes of this subsection, “unemployment benefits” means unemployment compensation, trade adjustment allowances, Federal additional compensation, and other unemployment assistance.
