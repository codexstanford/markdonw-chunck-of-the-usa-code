##### (f) 2 Standardized complaint form

(1) Development by the Secretary

The Secretary shall develop a standardized complaint form for use by a resident (or a person acting on the resident’s behalf) in filing a complaint with a State survey and certification agency and a State long-term care ombudsman program with respect to a facility.

(i) a resident of a facility; and

(ii) any person acting on the resident’s behalf.

The State must establish a complaint resolution process in order to ensure that the legal representative of a resident of a facility or other responsible party is not denied access to such resident or otherwise retaliated against if they have complained about the quality of care provided by the facility or other issues relating to the facility. Such complaint resolution process shall include

(i) procedures to assure accurate tracking of complaints received, including notification to the complainant that a complaint has been received;
