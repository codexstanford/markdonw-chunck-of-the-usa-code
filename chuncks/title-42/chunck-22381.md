(1) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a program for making grants for providing assistance to retail and wholesale motor fuel dealers or other entities for the installation, replacement, or conversion of motor fuel storage and dispensing infrastructure to be used exclusively to store and dispense renewable fuel blends.

(2) Selection criteria

Not later than 12 months after December 19, 2007 , the Secretary shall establish criteria for evaluating applications for grants under this subsection that will maximize the availability and use of renewable fuel blends, and that will ensure that renewable fuel blends are available across the country. Such criteria shall provide for

(A) consideration of the public demand for each renewable fuel blend in a particular geographic area based on State registration records showing the number of flexible-fuel vehicles;

(B) consideration of the opportunity to create or expand corridors of renewable fuel blend stations along interstate or State highways;

(C) consideration of the experience of each applicant with previous, similar projects;

(D) consideration of population, number of flexible-fuel vehicles, number of retail fuel outlets, and saturation of flexible-fuel vehicles; and

(E) priority consideration to applications that

(i) are most likely to maximize displacement of petroleum consumption, measured as a total quantity and a percentage;

(ii) are best able to incorporate existing infrastructure while maximizing, to the extent practicable, the use of renewable fuel blends; and

(iii) demonstrate the greatest commitment on the part of the applicant to ensure funding for the proposed project and the greatest likelihood that the project will be maintained or expanded after Federal assistance under this subsection is completed.

(3) Limitations

Assistance provided under this subsection shall not exceed

(A) 33 percent of the estimated cost of the installation, replacement, or conversion of motor fuel storage and dispensing infrastructure; or

(B) $180,000 for a combination of equipment at any one retail outlet location.

(4) Operation of renewable fuel blend stations

The Secretary shall establish rules that set forth requirements for grant recipients under this section that include providing to the public the renewable fuel blends, establishing a marketing plan that informs consumers of the price and availability of the renewable fuel blends, clearly labeling the dispensers and related equipment, and providing periodic reports on the status of the renewable fuel blend sales, the type and amount of the renewable fuel blends dispensed at each location, and the average price of such fuel.

(5) Notification requirements

Not later than the date on which each renewable fuel blend station begins to offer renewable fuel blends to the public, the grant recipient that used grant funds to construct or upgrade such station shall notify the Secretary of such opening. The Secretary shall add each new renewable fuel blend station to the renewable fuel blend station locator on its Website when it receives notification under this subsection.

(6) Double counting

No person that receives a credit under section 30C of title 26 may receive assistance under this section.

(7) Reservation of funds

The Secretary shall reserve funds appropriated for the renewable fuel blends infrastructure development grant program for technical and marketing assistance described in subsection (c).
