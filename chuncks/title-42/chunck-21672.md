#### § 16161d. Clean hydrogen electrolysis program
##### (e) Focus

The program shall focus on research relating to, and the development, demonstration, and deployment of

(1) low-temperature electrolyzers, including liquid-alkaline electrolyzers, membrane-based electrolyzers, and other advanced electrolyzers, capable of converting intermittent sources of electric power to clean hydrogen with enhanced efficiency and durability;

(2) high-temperature electrolyzers that combine electricity and heat to improve the efficiency of clean hydrogen production;

(3) advanced reversible fuel cells that combine the functionality of an electrolyzer and a fuel cell;

(4) new highly active, selective, and durable electrolyzer catalysts and electro-catalysts that

(A) greatly reduce or eliminate the need for platinum group metals; and

(B) enable electrolysis of complex mixtures with impurities, including seawater;

(5) modular electrolyzers for distributed energy systems and the bulk-power system (as defined in section 824 o (a) of title 16);

(6) low-cost membranes or electrolytes and separation materials that are durable in the presence of impurities or seawater;

(7) improved component design and material integration, including with respect to electrodes, porous transport layers and bipolar plates, and balance-of-system components, to allow for scale-up and domestic manufacturing of electrolyzers at a high volume;

(8) clean hydrogen storage technologies;

(9) technologies that integrate hydrogen production with

(A) clean hydrogen compression and drying technologies;

(B) clean hydrogen storage; and

(C) transportation or stationary systems; and

(10) integrated systems that combine hydrogen production with renewable power or nuclear power generation technologies, including hybrid systems with hydrogen storage.
