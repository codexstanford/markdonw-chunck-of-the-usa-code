### CHAPTER 105— COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAMS
#### § 9858f. Criminal background checks
##### (e) Background check results and appeals

(1) Background check results

The State shall carry out the request of a child care provider for a criminal background check as expeditiously as possible, but not to exceed 45 days after the date on which such request was submitted, and shall provide the results of the criminal background check to such provider and to the current or prospective staff member.

(2) Privacy

(A) In general

The State shall provide the results of the criminal background check to the provider in a statement that indicates whether a child care staff member (including a prospective child care staff member) is eligible or ineligible for employment described in subsection (c), without revealing any disqualifying crime or other related information regarding the individual.

(B) Ineligible staff member

If the child care staff member is ineligible for such employment due to the background check, the State will, when providing the results of the background check, include information related to each disqualifying crime, in a report to the staff member or prospective staff member.

(C) Public release of results

No State shall publicly release or share the results of individual background checks, except States may release aggregated data by crime as listed under subsection (c)(1)(D) from background check results, as long as such data is not personally identifiable information.

(3) Appeals

(A) In general

The State shall provide for a process by which a child care staff member (including a prospective child care staff member) may appeal the results of a criminal background check conducted under this section to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in such member’s criminal background report.

(B) Appeals process

The State shall ensure that

(i) each child care staff member shall be given notice of the opportunity to appeal;

(ii) a child care staff member will receive instructions about how to complete the appeals process if the child care staff member wishes to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in such member’s criminal background report; and

(iii) the appeals process is completed in a timely manner for each child care staff member.

(4) Review

The State may allow for a review process through which the State may determine that a child care staff member (including a prospective child care staff member) disqualified for a crime specified in subsection (c)(1)(D)(ix) is eligible for employment described in subsection (c)(1), notwithstanding subsection (c). The review process shall be consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.).

(5) No private right of action

Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a private right of action if a provider has acted in accordance with this section.
