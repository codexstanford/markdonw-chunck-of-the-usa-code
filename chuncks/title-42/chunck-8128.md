##### (g) Prospective payment for capital-related costs; return on equity capital for hospitals

(1)

(A) Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title , instead of any amounts that are otherwise payable under this subchapter with respect to the reasonable costs of subsection (d) hospitals and subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals for capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services, the Secretary shall, for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 , provide for payments for such costs in accordance with a prospective payment system established by the Secretary. Aggregate payments made under subsection (d) and this subsection during fiscal years 1992 through 1995 shall be reduced in a manner that results in a reduction (as estimated by the Secretary) in the amount of such payments equal to a 10 percent reduction in the amount of payments attributable to capital-related costs that would otherwise have been made during such fiscal year had the amount of such payments been based on reasonable costs (as defined in section 1395x(v) of this title ). For discharges occurring after September 30, 1993 , the Secretary shall reduce by 7.4 percent the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in 42 CFR 412.308(c), as in effect on August 10, 1993 ) and shall (for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 ) redetermine which payment methodology is applied to the hospital under such system to take into account such reduction. In addition to the reduction described in the preceding sentence, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 , the Secretary shall apply the budget neutrality adjustment factor used to determine the Federal capital payment rate in effect on September 30, 1995 (as described in section 412.352 of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations), to (i) the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in section 412.308(c) of that title, as in effect on September 30, 1997 ), and (ii) the unadjusted hospital-specific rate (as described in section 412.328(e)(1) of that title, as in effect on September 30, 1997 ), and, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 , and before October 1, 2002 , reduce the rates described in clauses (i) and (ii) by 2.1 percent.
