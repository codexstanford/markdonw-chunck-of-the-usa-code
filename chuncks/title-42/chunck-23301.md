### CHAPTER 161— DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
#### § 18644. Biological and environmental research
##### (h) Biological and environmental research user facilities

(1) In general

The Director shall carry out a program for the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of user facilities to enhance the collection and analysis of observational data related to complex biological, climate, and environmental systems.

(2) Selection

(A) In general

The Director shall select user facilities under paragraph (1) on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis.

(B) Applicants

In selecting user facilities under paragraph (1), the Director shall consider applications from the National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, multi-institutional collaborations, and other appropriate entities.

(3) Facility requirements

To the maximum extent practicable, the user facilities developed, constructed, operated, or maintained under paragraph (1) shall include

(A) distributed field research and observation platforms for understanding earth system processes;

(B) analytical techniques, instruments, and modeling resources, including high-throughput molecular phenotyping, for understanding and predicting the functional processes of biological and environmental systems;

(C) integrated high-throughput sequencing, advanced bioanalytic techniques, DNA design and synthesis, metabolomics, and computational analysis; and

(D) such other facilities as the Director considers appropriate, consistent with section 7139 of this title .

(4) Existing facilities

In carrying out the program established under paragraph (1), the Director is encouraged to evaluate the capabilities of existing user facilities and, to the maximum extent practicable, invest in modernization of those capabilities to address emerging research priorities.

(5) Earth and environmental systems sciences user facilities

In carrying out the program established under paragraph (1), the Director shall operate at least 1 user facility to advance the collection, validation, and analysis of atmospheric data, including through activities

(A) to advance knowledge of the Earth and environmental systems and improve model representations; and

(B) to measure the impact of atmospheric gases, aerosols, and clouds on the Earth and environmental systems.

(6) Microbial molecular phenotyping capability project

(A) In general

The Secretary shall provide for the expansion of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, or subsequent facility successor, to advance high-throughput microbial plant and molecular phenotyping capability to accelerate discovery of new protein functions and metabolic pathways in microbial systems.

(B) Capabilities

In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure the following capabilities:

(i) Coupled high-throughput autonomous experimental and multimodal analytical capabilities.

(ii) Direct integration of automated multiomics analyses, biomolecular and cellular imaging, and functional biological assays with high-throughput microbial culturing and cultivation capabilities at timescales relevant to biological processes under natural and perturbed environmental conditions.

(C) Data coordination

In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure integration and coordination with existing data platforms and user facilities of the Department.

(D) Start of operations

Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall begin carrying out subparagraph (A) not later than September 29, 2027 .

(E) Funding

Of the funds authorized to be appropriated under subsection (k) for a fiscal year, there are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this paragraph

(i) $550,000 for fiscal year 2023;

(ii) $29,000,000 for fiscal year 2024;

(iii) $32,000,000 for fiscal year 2025;

(iv) $30,500,000 for fiscal year 2026; and

(v) $27,500,000 for fiscal year 2027.

(7) User facilities integration and collaboration program

(A) In general

The Director shall support a program of collaboration between user facilities to encourage and enable researchers to more readily integrate the tools, expertise, resources, and capabilities of multiple Office of Science user facilities (as described in subsection (d) of section 7139 of this title ) to further research and advance emerging technologies.

(B) Activities

The program shall advance the integration of automation, robotics, computational biology, bioinformatics, biosensing, cellular platforms and other relevant emerging technologies as determined by the Director to enhance productivity and scientific impact of user facilities.

(8) Coordination

In carrying out the program authorized under paragraph (1), the Director shall ensure that the Office of Science coordinates with

(A) the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and any other relevant Federal agency on the collection, validation, and analysis of atmospheric data; and

(B) relevant stakeholders, including institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, industry, State, territorial, local, and Tribal governments, and other appropriate entities to ensure access to the best available relevant atmospheric and historical weather data.
