(1) Beginning April 1, 1990 , for provisions relating to the extension of eligibility for medical assistance for certain families who have received aid pursuant to a State plan approved under part A of subchapter IV and have earned income, see section 1396r–6 of this title .

(2)

(A) In the case of an individual who is enrolled with a medicaid managed care organization (as defined in section 1396b(m)(1)(A) of this title ), with a primary care case manager (as defined in section 1396d(t) of this title ), or with an eligible organization with a contract under section 1395mm of this title and who would (but for this paragraph) lose eligibility for benefits under this subchapter before the end of the minimum enrollment period (defined in subparagraph (B)), the State plan may provide, notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, that the individual shall be deemed to continue to be eligible for such benefits until the end of such minimum period, but, except for benefits furnished under section 1396d(a)(4)(C) of this title , only with respect to such benefits provided to the individual as an enrollee of such organization or entity or by or through the case manager.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “minimum enrollment period” means, with respect to an individual’s enrollment with an organization or entity under a State plan, a period, established by the State, of not more than six months beginning on the date the individual’s enrollment with the organization or entity becomes effective.

(3) At the option of the State, any individual who

(A) is 18 years of age or younger and qualifies as a disabled individual under section 1382c(a) of this title ;

(B) with respect to whom there has been a determination by the State that

(i) the individual requires a level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded,

(ii) it is appropriate to provide such care for the individual outside such an institution, and

(iii) the estimated amount which would be expended for medical assistance for the individual for such care outside an institution is not greater than the estimated amount which would otherwise be expended for medical assistance for the individual within an appropriate institution; and

(C) if the individual were in a medical institution, would be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan under this subchapter, shall be deemed, for purposes of this subchapter only, to be an individual with respect to whom a supplemental security income payment, or State supplemental payment, respectively, is being paid under subchapter XVI.

(4) A child born to a woman eligible for and receiving medical assistance under a State plan on the date of the child’s birth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and to have been found eligible for such assistance under such plan on the date of such birth and to remain eligible for such assistance for a period of one year. During the period in which a child is deemed under the preceding sentence to be eligible for medical assistance, the medical assistance eligibility identification number of the mother shall also serve as the identification number of the child, and all claims shall be submitted and paid under such number (unless the State issues a separate identification number for the child before such period expires). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a child who is born in the United States to an alien mother for whom medical assistance for the delivery of the child is made available pursuant to section 1396b(v) of this title , the State immediately shall issue a separate identification number for the child upon notification by the facility at which such delivery occurred of the child’s birth.

(6) In the case of a pregnant woman described in subsection (a)(10) who, because of a change in income of the family of which she is a member, would not otherwise continue to be described in such subsection, the woman shall be deemed to continue to be an individual described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and subsection ( l )(1)(A) without regard to such change of income through the end of the month in which the 60-day period (beginning on the last day of her pregnancy) ends. The preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of a woman who has been provided ambulatory prenatal care pursuant to section 1396r–1 of this title during a presumptive eligibility period and is then, in accordance with such section, determined to be ineligible for medical assistance under the State plan.

(7) In the case of an infant or child described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of subsection ( l )(1) or paragraph (2) of section 1396d(n) of this title

(A) who is receiving inpatient services for which medical assistance is provided on the date the infant or child attains the maximum age with respect to which coverage is provided under the State plan for such individuals, and

(B) who, but for attaining such age, would remain eligible for medical assistance under such subsection, the infant or child shall continue to be treated as an individual described in such respective provision until the end of the stay for which the inpatient services are furnished.

(8) If an individual is determined to be a qualified medicare beneficiary (as defined in section 1396d(p)(1) of this title ), such determination shall apply to services furnished after the end of the month in which the determination first occurs. For purposes of payment to a State under section 1396b(a) of this title , such determination shall be considered to be valid for an individual for a period of 12 months, except that a State may provide for such determinations more frequently, but not more frequently than once every 6 months for an individual.
