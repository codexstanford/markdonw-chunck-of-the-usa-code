### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300x–30. Maintenance of effort regarding State expenditures
##### (d) Noncompliance by State

(1) In general

In making a grant under section 300x–21 of this title to a State for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall make a determination of whether, for the previous fiscal year, the State maintained material compliance with any agreement made under subsection (a). If the Secretary determines that a State has failed to maintain such compliance, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment under section 300x–21 of this title for the State for the fiscal year for which the grant is being made by an amount equal to the amount constituting such failure for the previous fiscal year.

(2) Submission of information to Secretary

The Secretary may make a grant under section 300x–21 of this title for a fiscal year only if the State involved submits to the Secretary information sufficient for the Secretary to make the determination required in paragraph (1).

(3) Alternative

A State that has failed to comply with this section and would otherwise be subject to a reduction in the State’s allotment under section 300x–21 of this title , may, upon request by the State, in lieu of having the State’s allotment under section 300x–21 of this title reduced, agree to comply with a negotiated agreement that is approved by the Secretary and carried out in accordance with guidelines issued by the Secretary. If a State fails to enter into or comply with a negotiated agreement, the Secretary may take action under this paragraph or the terms of the negotiated agreement.
