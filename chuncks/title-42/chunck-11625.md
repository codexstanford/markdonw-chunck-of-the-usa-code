#### § 2642. Acceleration of public works
##### (c) Grants-in-aid; law governing; amount of Federal contributions

All grants-in-aid made from allocations made by the President under this section shall be made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government administering the law authorizing such grants, and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, shall be made in accordance with all of the provisions of such law except (1) provisions requiring allocation of funds among the States, and (2) limitations upon the total amount of such grants for any period. Notwithstanding any provisions of such law requiring the Federal contribution to the State or local government involved to be less than a fixed portion of the cost of a project, grants-in-aid may be made under authority of this section which bring the total of all Federal contributions to such project up to 50 per centum of the cost of such project, or up to 75 per centum of the cost of such project if the State or local government does not have economic and financial capacity to assume all of the additional financial obligations required.
