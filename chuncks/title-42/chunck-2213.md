(A) and which is an applicable clinical trial as defined in section 282(j) of this title , the entity conducting such clinical research shall submit the results of such valid analysis to the clinical trial registry data bank expanded under section 282(j)(3) of this title , and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall, as appropriate, consider whether such entity has complied with the reporting requirement described in this subparagraph in awarding any future grant to such entity, including pursuant to section 282(j)(5)(A)(ii) of this title when applicable; and

(B) the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall encourage the reporting of the results of such valid analysis described in paragraph (1) through any additional means determined appropriate by the Director.
