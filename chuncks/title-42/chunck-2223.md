#### § 289b–1. Protection against financial conflicts of interest in certain projects of research
##### (a) Issuance of regulations

The Secretary shall by regulation define the specific circumstances that constitute the existence of a financial interest in a project on the part of an entity or individual that will, or may be reasonably expected to, create a bias in favor of obtaining results in such project that are consistent with such financial interest. Such definition shall apply uniformly to each entity or individual conducting a research project under this chapter. In the case of any entity or individual receiving assistance from the Secretary for a project of research described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall by regulation establish standards for responding to, including managing, reducing, or eliminating, the existence of such a financial interest. The entity may adopt individualized procedures for implementing the standards.
