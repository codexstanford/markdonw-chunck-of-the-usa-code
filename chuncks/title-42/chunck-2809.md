#### § 291j–3. Applications and conditions
##### (b) Conditions for approval

The Secretary may approve such application only if

(1) there remains sufficient balance in the allotment determined for such State pursuant to section 291j–2 of this title to cover the amount of the loan for which a guarantee is sought, or the amount of the direct loan sought (as the case may be), in such application,

(2) he makes each of the findings which are required by clauses (1) through (4) of section 291e(b) of this title for the approval of applications for projects thereunder (except that, in the case of the finding required under such clause (4) of entitlement of a project to a priority established under section 291c(a) of this title ; such finding shall be made without regard to the provisions of clauses (1) and (3) of such section),

(3) he finds that there is compliance with section 291e(e) of this title ,

(4) he obtains assurances that the applicant will keep such records, and afford such access thereto, and make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may reasonably require, and

(5) he also determines, in the case of a loan for which a guarantee is sought, that the terms, conditions, maturity, security (if any), and schedule and amounts of repayments with respect to the loan are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and are otherwise reasonable and in accord with regulations, including a determination that the rate of interest does not exceed such per centum per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States.
