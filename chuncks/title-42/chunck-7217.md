(1) Estimate of expenditures

Before the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2000), the Secretary shall estimate the level of expenditures under this part for services described in subsection (a) for that fiscal year.

(2) Adjustment in payments

(A) Proportional adjustment

If the Secretary determines that the level estimated under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year will exceed the trigger level (as defined in subparagraph (C)) for that fiscal year, the Secretary shall, subject to subparagraph (B), provide for such a proportional reduction in payment amounts under this part for services described in subsection (a) for the fiscal year involved as will assure that such level (taking into account any adjustment under subparagraph (B)) does not exceed the trigger level for that fiscal year.

(B) Alternative adjustments

The Secretary may, instead of making some or all of the reduction described in subparagraph (A), impose such other conditions or limitations with respect to the coverage of covered services (including limitations on new elections of coverage and new facilities) as may be appropriate to reduce the level of expenditures described in paragraph (1) to the trigger level.

(C) Trigger level

For purposes of this subsection

(i) In general

Subject to adjustment under paragraph (3)(B), the “trigger level” for a year is the unadjusted trigger level described in clause (ii).

(ii) Unadjusted trigger level

The “unadjusted trigger level” for

(I) fiscal year 1998, is $20,000,000, or

(II) a succeeding fiscal year is the amount specified under this clause for the previous fiscal year increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) for the 12-month period ending with July preceding the beginning of the fiscal year.

(D) Prohibition of administrative and judicial review

There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title , 1395 oo of this title, or otherwise of the estimation of expenditures under subparagraph (A) or the application of reduction amounts under subparagraph (B).

(E) Effect on billing

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, in the case of a reduction in payment provided under this subsection for services of a religious nonmedical health care institution provided to an individual, the amount that the institution is otherwise permitted to charge the individual for such services is increased by the amount of such reduction.

(3) Monitoring expenditure level

(A) In general

The Secretary shall monitor the expenditure level described in paragraph (2)(A) for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1999).

(B) Adjustment in trigger level

(i) In general

If the Secretary determines that such level for a fiscal year exceeded, or was less than, the trigger level for that fiscal year, then, subject to clause (ii), the trigger level for the succeeding fiscal year shall be reduced, or increased, respectively, by the amount of such excess or deficit.

(ii) Limitation on carryforward

In no case may the increase effected under clause (i) for a fiscal year exceed $50,000,000.
