### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396u–2. Provisions relating to managed care
##### (e) Sanctions for noncompliance

(1) Use of intermediate sanctions by the State to enforce requirements

(A) In general

A State may not enter into or renew a contract under section 1396b(m) of this title unless the State has established intermediate sanctions, which may include any of the types described in paragraph (2), other than the termination of a contract with a medicaid managed care organization, which the State may impose against a medicaid managed care organization with such a contract, if the organization

(i) fails substantially to provide medically necessary items and services that are required (under law or under such organization’s contract with the State) to be provided to an enrollee covered under the contract;

(ii) imposes premiums or charges on enrollees in excess of the premiums or charges permitted under this subchapter;

(iii) acts to discriminate among enrollees on the basis of their health status or requirements for health care services, including expulsion or refusal to reenroll an individual, except as permitted by this subchapter, or engaging in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging enrollment with the organization by eligible individuals whose medical condition or history indicates a need for substantial future medical services;

(iv) misrepresents or falsifies information that is furnished

(I) to the Secretary or the State under this subchapter; or

(II) to an enrollee, potential enrollee, or a health care provider under such subchapter; or

(v) fails to comply with the applicable requirements of section 1396b(m)(2)(A)(x) of this title . The State may also impose such intermediate sanction against a managed care entity if the State determines that the entity distributed directly or through any agent or independent contractor marketing materials in violation of subsection (d)(2)(A)(i)(II).

(B) Rule of construction

Clause (i) of subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the provision of abortion services, except that a State may impose a sanction on any medicaid managed care organization that has a contract to provide abortion services if the organization does not provide such services as provided for under the contract.

(2) Intermediate sanctions

The sanctions described in this paragraph are as follows:

(A) Civil money penalties as follows:

(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), (iii), or (iv), not more than $25,000 for each determination under paragraph (1)(A).

(ii) With respect to a determination under clause (iii) or (iv)(I) of paragraph (1)(A), not more than $100,000 for each such determination.

(iii) With respect to a determination under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), double the excess amount charged in violation of such subsection (and the excess amount charged shall be deducted from the penalty and returned to the individual concerned).

(iv) Subject to clause (ii), with respect to a determination under paragraph (1)(A)(iii), $15,000 for each individual not enrolled as a result of a practice described in such subsection.

(B) The appointment of temporary management

(i) to oversee the operation of the medicaid managed care organization upon a finding by the State that there is continued egregious behavior by the organization or there is a substantial risk to the health of enrollees; or

(ii) to assure the health of the organization’s enrollees, if there is a need for temporary management while

(I) there is an orderly termination or reorganization of the organization; or

(II) improvements are made to remedy the violations found under paragraph (1),  except that temporary management under this subparagraph may not be terminated until the State has determined that the medicaid managed care organization has the capability to ensure that the violations shall not recur.

(C) Permitting individuals enrolled with the managed care entity to terminate enrollment without cause, and notifying such individuals of such right to terminate enrollment.

(D) Suspension or default of all enrollment of individuals under this subchapter after the date the Secretary or the State notifies the entity of a determination of a violation of any requirement of section 1396b(m) of this title or this section.

(E) Suspension of payment to the entity under this subchapter for individuals enrolled after the date the Secretary or State notifies the entity of such a determination and until the Secretary or State is satisfied that the basis for such determination has been corrected and is not likely to recur.

(3) Treatment of chronic substandard entities

In the case of a medicaid managed care organization which has repeatedly failed to meet the requirements of section 1396b(m) of this title and this section, the State shall (regardless of what other sanctions are provided) impose the sanctions described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2).

(4) Authority to terminate contract

(A) In general

In the case of a managed care entity which has failed to meet the requirements of this part or a contract under section 1396b(m) or 1396d(t)(3) of this title, the State shall have the authority to terminate such contract with the entity and to enroll such entity’s enrollees with other managed care entities (or to permit such enrollees to receive medical assistance under the State plan under this subchapter other than through a managed care entity).

(B) Availability of hearing prior to termination of contract

A State may not terminate a contract with a managed care entity under subparagraph (A) unless the entity is provided with a hearing prior to the termination.

(C) Notice and right to disenroll in cases of termination hearing

A State may

(i) notify individuals enrolled with a managed care entity which is the subject of a hearing to terminate the entity’s contract with the State of the hearing, and

(ii) in the case of such an entity, permit such enrollees to disenroll immediately with the entity without cause.

(5) Other protections for managed care entities against sanctions imposed by State

Before imposing any sanction against a managed care entity other than termination of the entity’s contract, the State shall provide the entity with notice and such other due process protections as the State may provide, except that a State may not provide a managed care entity with a pre-termination hearing before imposing the sanction described in paragraph (2)(B).
