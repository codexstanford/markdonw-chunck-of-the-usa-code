#### § 1395w–4. Payment for physicians’ services
##### (d) Conversion factors

(1) Establishment

(A) In general

The conversion factor for each year shall be the conversion factor established under this subsection for the previous year (or, in the case of 1992, specified in subparagraph (B)) adjusted by the update (established under paragraph (3)) for the year involved (for years before 2001) and, for years beginning with 2001 and ending with 2025, multiplied by the update (established under paragraph (4) or a subsequent paragraph) for the year involved. There shall be two separate conversion factors for each year beginning with 2026, one for items and services furnished by a qualifying APM participant (as defined in section 1395 l (z)(2) of this title) (referred to in this subsection as the “qualifying APM conversion factor”) and the other for other items and services (referred to in this subsection as the “nonqualifying APM conversion factor”), equal to the respective conversion factor for the previous year (or, in the case of 2026, equal to the single conversion factor for 2025) multiplied by the update established under paragraph (20) for such respective conversion factor for such year.

(B) Special provision for 1992

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the conversion factor specified in this subparagraph is a conversion factor (determined by the Secretary) which, if this section were to apply during 1991 using such conversion factor, would result in the same aggregate amount of payments under this part for physicians’ services as the estimated aggregate amount of the payments under this part for such services in 1991.

(C) Special rules for 1998

Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the single conversion factor for 1998 under this subsection shall be the conversion factor for primary care services for 1997, increased by the Secretary’s estimate of the weighted average of the three separate updates that would otherwise occur were it not for the enactment of chapter 1 of subtitle F of title IV of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

(D) Special rules for anesthesia services

The separate conversion factor for anesthesia services for a year shall be equal to 46 percent of the single conversion factor (or, beginning with 2026, applicable conversion factor) established for other physicians’ services, except as adjusted for changes in work, practice expense, or malpractice relative value units.

(E) Publication and dissemination of information

The Secretary shall

(i) cause to have published in the Federal Register not later than November 1 of each year (beginning with 2000) the conversion factor which will apply to physicians’ services for the succeeding year, the update determined under paragraph (4) for such succeeding year, and the allowed expenditures under such paragraph for such succeeding year; and

(ii) make available to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the public by March 1 of each year (beginning with 2000) an estimate of the sustainable growth rate and of the conversion factor which will apply to physicians’ services for the succeeding year and data used in making such estimate.

(2) Repealed. Pub. L. 105–33, title IV, § 4502(b) , Aug. 5, 1997 , 111 Stat. 433

(3) Update for 1999 and 2000

(A) In general

Unless otherwise provided by law, subject to subparagraph (D) and the budget-neutrality factor determined by the Secretary under subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii), the update to the single conversion factor established in paragraph (1)(C) for 1999 and 2000 is equal to the product of

(i) 1 plus the Secretary’s estimate of the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title ) for the year (divided by 100), and

(ii) 1 plus the Secretary’s estimate of the update adjustment factor for the year (divided by 100), minus 1 and multiplied by 100.

(B) Update adjustment factor

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the “update adjustment factor” for a year is equal (as estimated by the Secretary) to

(i) the difference between (I) the sum of the allowed expenditures for physicians’ services (as determined under subparagraph (C)) for the period beginning April 1, 1997 , and ending on March 31 of the year involved, and (II) the amount of actual expenditures for physicians’ services furnished during the period beginning April 1, 1997 , and ending on March 31 of the preceding year; divided by

(ii) the actual expenditures for physicians’ services for the 12-month period ending on March 31 of the preceding year, increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the fiscal year which begins during such 12-month period.

(C) Determination of allowed expenditures

For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (4), the allowed expenditures for physicians’ services for the 12-month period ending with March 31 of

(i) 1997 is equal to the actual expenditures for physicians’ services furnished during such 12-month period, as estimated by the Secretary; or

(ii) a subsequent year is equal to the allowed expenditures for physicians’ services for the previous year, increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the fiscal year which begins during such 12-month period.

(D) Restriction on variation from medicare economic index

Notwithstanding the amount of the update adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (B) for a year, the update in the conversion factor under this paragraph for the year may not be

(i) greater than 100 times the following amount: (1.03 + (MEI percentage/100)) −1; or

(ii) less than 100 times the following amount: (0.93 + (MEI percentage/100)) −1, where “MEI percentage” means the Secretary’s estimate of the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title ) for the year involved.

(4) Update for years beginning with 2001 and ending with 2014

(A) In general

Unless otherwise provided by law, subject to the budget-neutrality factor determined by the Secretary under subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii) and subject to adjustment under subparagraph (F), the update to the single conversion factor established in paragraph (1)(C) for a year beginning with 2001 and ending with 2014 is equal to the product of

(i) 1 plus the Secretary’s estimate of the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in section 1395u(i)(3) of this title ) for the year (divided by 100); and

(ii) 1 plus the Secretary’s estimate of the update adjustment factor under subparagraph (B) for the year.

(B) Update adjustment factor

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), subject to subparagraph (D) and the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, the “update adjustment factor” for a year is equal (as estimated by the Secretary) to the sum of the following:

(i) Prior year adjustment component

An amount determined by

(I) computing the difference (which may be positive or negative) between the amount of the allowed expenditures for physicians’ services for the prior year (as determined under subparagraph (C)) and the amount of the actual expenditures for such services for that year;

(II) dividing that difference by the amount of the actual expenditures for such services for that year; and

(III) multiplying that quotient by 0.75.

(ii) Cumulative adjustment component

An amount determined by

(I) computing the difference (which may be positive or negative) between the amount of the allowed expenditures for physicians’ services (as determined under subparagraph (C)) from April 1, 1996 , through the end of the prior year and the amount of the actual expenditures for such services during that period;

(II) dividing that difference by actual expenditures for such services for the prior year as increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the year for which the update adjustment factor is to be determined; and

(III) multiplying that quotient by 0.33.

(C) Determination of allowed expenditures

For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) Period up to April 1, 1999

The allowed expenditures for physicians’ services for a period before April 1, 1999 , shall be the amount of the allowed expenditures for such period as determined under paragraph (3)(C).

(ii) Transition to calendar year allowed expenditures

Subject to subparagraph (E), the allowed expenditures for

(I) the 9-month period beginning April 1, 1999 , shall be the Secretary’s estimate of the amount of the allowed expenditures that would be permitted under paragraph (3)(C) for such period; and

(II) the year of 1999, shall be the Secretary’s estimate of the amount of the allowed expenditures that would be permitted under paragraph (3)(C) for such year.

(iii) Years beginning with 2000

The allowed expenditures for a year (beginning with 2000) is equal to the allowed expenditures for physicians’ services for the previous year, increased by the sustainable growth rate under subsection (f) for the year involved.

(D) Restriction on update adjustment factor

The update adjustment factor determined under subparagraph (B) for a year may not be less than −0.07 or greater than 0.03.

(E) Recalculation of allowed expenditures for updates beginning with 2001

For purposes of determining the update adjustment factor for a year beginning with 2001, the Secretary shall recompute the allowed expenditures for previous periods beginning on or after April 1, 1999 , consistent with subsection (f)(3).

(F) Transitional adjustment designed to provide for budget neutrality
