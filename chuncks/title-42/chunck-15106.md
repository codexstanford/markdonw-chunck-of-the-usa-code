### CHAPTER 82— SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
#### § 6901. Congressional findings
##### (c) Materials

The Congress finds with respect to materials, that

(1) millions of tons of recoverable material which could be used are needlessly buried each year;

(2) methods are available to separate usable materials from solid waste; and

(3) the recovery and conservation of such materials can reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign resources and reduce the deficit in its balance of payments.
