### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (l) Standards for other covered products

(1) The Secretary may prescribe an energy conservation standard for any type (or class) of covered products of a type specified in paragraph (20) of section 6292(a) of this title if the requirements of subsections ( o ) and (p) are met and the Secretary determines that

(A) the average per household energy use within the United States by products of such type (or class) exceeded 150 kilowatt-hours (or its Btu equivalent) for any 12-month period ending before such determination;

(B) the aggregate household energy use within the United States by products of such type (or class) exceeded 4,200,000,000 kilowatt-hours (or its Btu equivalent) for any such 12-month period;

(C) substantial improvement in the energy efficiency of products of such type (or class) is technologically feasible; and

(D) the application of a labeling rule under section 6294 of this title to such type (or class) is not likely to be sufficient to induce manufacturers to produce, and consumers and other persons to purchase, covered products of such type (or class) which achieve the maximum energy efficiency which is technologically feasible and economically justified.

(2) Any new or amended standard for covered products of a type specified in paragraph (20) of section 6292(a) of this title shall not apply to products manufactured within five years after the publication of a final rule establishing such standard.

(3) The Secretary may, in accordance with subsections ( o ) and (p), prescribe an energy conservation standard for television sets. Any such standard may not become effective with respect to products manufactured before January 1, 1992 .

(4) Energy efficiency standards for certain lamps.

(A) In general .

The Secretary shall prescribe an energy efficiency standard for rough service lamps, vibration service lamps, 3-way incandescent lamps, 2,601–3,300 lumen general service incandescent lamps, and shatter-resistant lamps in accordance with this paragraph.

(B) Benchmarks .

Not later than 1 year after December 19, 2007 , the Secretary, in consultation with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, shall

(i) collect actual data for United States unit sales for each of calendar years 1990 through 2006 for each of the 5 types of lamps described in subparagraph (A) to determine the historical growth rate of the type of lamp; and

(ii) construct a model for each type of lamp based on coincident economic indicators that closely match the historical annual growth rate of the type of lamp to provide a neutral comparison benchmark to model future unit sales after calendar year 2006.

(C) Actual sales data.

(i) In general .

Effective for each of calendar years 2010 through 2025, the Secretary, in consultation with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, shall

(I) collect actual United States unit sales data for each of 5 types of lamps described in subparagraph (A); and

(II) not later than 90 days after the end of each calendar year, compare the lamp sales in that year with the sales predicted by the comparison benchmark for each of the 5 types of lamps described in subparagraph (A).

(ii) Continuation of tracking.

(I) Determination .

Not later than January 1, 2023 , the Secretary shall determine if actual sales data should be tracked for the lamp types described in subparagraph (A) after calendar year 2025.

(II) Continuation .

If the Secretary finds that the market share of a lamp type described in subparagraph (A) could significantly erode the market share for general service lamps, the Secretary shall continue to track the actual sales data for the lamp type.

(D) Rough service lamps.

(i) In general .

Effective beginning with the first year that the reported annual sales rate for rough service lamps demonstrates actual unit sales of rough service lamps that achieve levels that are at least 100 percent higher than modeled unit sales for that same year, the Secretary shall

(I) not later than 90 days after the end of the previous calendar year, issue a finding that the index has been exceeded; and

(II) not later than the date that is 1 year after the end of the previous calendar year, complete an accelerated rulemaking to establish an energy conservation standard for rough service lamps.

(ii) Backstop requirement .

If the Secretary fails to complete an accelerated rulemaking in accordance with clause (i)(II), effective beginning 1 year after the date of the issuance of the finding under clause (i)(I), the Secretary shall require rough service lamps to

(I) have a shatter-proof coating or equivalent technology that is compliant with NSF/ANSI 51 and is designed to contain the glass if the glass envelope of the lamp is broken and to provide effective containment over the life of the lamp;

(II) have a maximum 40-watt limitation; and

(III) be sold at retail only in a package containing 1 lamp.

(E) Vibration service lamps.

(i) In general .

Effective beginning with the first year that the reported annual sales rate for vibration service lamps demonstrates actual unit sales of vibration service lamps that achieve levels that are at least 100 percent higher than modeled unit sales for that same year, the Secretary shall

(I) not later than 90 days after the end of the previous calendar year, issue a finding that the index has been exceeded; and

(II) not later than the date that is 1 year after the end of the previous calendar year, complete an accelerated rulemaking to establish an energy conservation standard for vibration service lamps.

(ii) Backstop requirement .

If the Secretary fails to complete an accelerated rulemaking in accordance with clause (i)(II), effective beginning 1 year after the date of the issuance of the finding under clause (i)(I), the Secretary shall require vibration service lamps to

(I) have a maximum 40-watt limitation; and

(II) be sold at retail only in a package containing 1 lamp.

(F) 3- way incandescent lamps.

(i) In general .

Effective beginning with the first year that the reported annual sales rate for 3-way incandescent lamps demonstrates actual unit sales of 3-way incandescent lamps that achieve levels that are at least 100 percent higher than modeled unit sales for that same year, the Secretary shall

(I) not later than 90 days after the end of the previous calendar year, issue a finding that the index has been exceeded; and

(II) not later than the date that is 1 year after the end of the previous calendar year, complete an accelerated rulemaking to establish an energy conservation standard for 3-way incandescent lamps.
