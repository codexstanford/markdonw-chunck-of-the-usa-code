#### § 4022. State and local land use controls
##### (b) Community rating system and incentives for community floodplain management

(1) Authority and goals

The Administrator shall carry out a community rating system program, under which communities participate voluntarily

(A) to provide incentives for measures that reduce the risk of flood or erosion damage that exceed the criteria set forth in section 4102 of this title and evaluate such measures;

(B) to encourage adoption of more effective measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions;

(C) to encourage floodplain and erosion management; and

(D) to promote the reduction of Federal flood insurance losses.

(2) Incentives

The program shall provide incentives in the form of credits on premium rates for flood insurance coverage in communities that the Administrator determines have adopted and enforced measures that reduce the risk of flood and erosion damage that exceed the criteria set forth in section 4102 of this title . In providing incentives under this paragraph, the Administrator may provide for credits to flood insurance premium rates in communities that the Administrator determines have implemented measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions.

(3) Credits

The credits on premium rates for flood insurance coverage shall be based on the estimated reduction in flood and erosion damage risks resulting from the measures adopted by the community under this program. If a community has received mitigation assistance under section 4104c of this title , the credits shall be phased in a manner, determined by the Administrator, to recover the amount of such assistance provided for the community.

(4) Reports

Not later than 2 years after September 23, 1994 , and not less than every 2 years thereafter, the Administrator shall submit a report to the Congress regarding the program under this subsection. Each report shall include an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the program, any other accomplishments or shortcomings of the program, and any recommendations of the Administrator for legislation regarding the program.
