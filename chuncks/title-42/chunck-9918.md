#### § 1786. Special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children
##### (f) Plan of operation and administration by State agency
######## (D) Each local agency operating the program within a hospital and each local agency operating the program that has a cooperative arrangement with a hospital shall

(i) advise potentially eligible individuals that receive inpatient or outpatient prenatal, maternity, or postpartum services, or accompany a child under the age of 5 who receives well-child services, of the availability of program benefits; and

(ii) to the extent feasible, provide an opportunity for individuals who may be eligible to be certified within the hospital for participation in such program.

(8)

(A) The State agency shall grant a fair hearing, and a prompt determination thereafter, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, to any applicant, participant, or local agency aggrieved by the action of a State or local agency as it affects participation.

(B) Any State agency that must suspend or terminate benefits to any participant during the participant’s certification period due to a shortage of funds for the program shall first issue a notice to such participant.

(9) If an individual certified as eligible for participation in the program under this section in one area moves to another area in which the program is operating, that individual’s certification of eligibility shall remain valid for the period for which the individual was originally certified.

(10) The Secretary shall establish standards for the proper, efficient, and effective administration of the program. If the Secretary determines that a State agency has failed without good cause to administer the program in a manner consistent with this section or to implement the approved plan of operation and administration under this subsection, the Secretary may withhold such amounts of the State agency’s funds for nutrition services and administration as the Secretary deems appropriate. Upon correction of such failure during a fiscal year by a State agency, any funds so withheld for such fiscal year shall be provided the State agency.

(11) Supplemental foods.

(A) In general .

The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the supplemental foods to be made available in the program under this section.

(B) Appropriate content .

To the degree possible, the Secretary shall assure that the fat, sugar, and salt content of the prescribed foods is appropriate.

(C) Review of available supplemental foods .

As frequently as determined by the Secretary to be necessary to reflect the most recent scientific knowledge, but not less than every 10 years, the Secretary shall

(i) conduct a scientific review of the supplemental foods available under the program; and

(ii) amend the supplemental foods available, as necessary, to reflect nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns.

(12) A competent professional authority shall be responsible for prescribing the appropriate supplemental foods, taking into account medical and nutritional conditions and cultural eating patterns, and, in the case of homeless individuals, the special needs and problems of such individuals.

(13) The State agency may (A) provide nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion, and drug abuse education materials and instruction in languages other than English and (B) use appropriate foreign language materials in the administration of the program, in areas in which a substantial number of low-income households speak a language other than English.

(14) If a State agency determines that a member of a family has received an overissuance of food benefits under the program authorized by this section as the result of such member intentionally making a false or misleading statement or intentionally misrepresenting, concealing, or withholding facts, the State agency shall recover, in cash, from such member an amount that the State agency determines is equal to the value of the overissued food benefits, unless the State agency determines that the recovery of the benefits would not be cost effective.

(15) To be eligible to participate in the program authorized by this section, a manufacturer of infant formula that supplies formula for the program shall

(A) register with the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]; and

(B) before bidding for a State contract to supply infant formula for the program, certify with the State health department that the formula complies with such Act and regulations issued pursuant to such Act.

(16) The State agency may adopt methods of delivering benefits to accommodate the special needs and problems of homeless individuals.

(17) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(2)(A)(i), not later than July 1 of each year, a State agency may implement income eligibility guidelines under this section concurrently with the implementation of income eligibility guidelines under the medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).

(18) Each local agency participating in the program under this section may provide information about other potential sources of food assistance in the local area to individuals who apply in person to participate in the program under this section, but who cannot be served because the program is operating at capacity in the local area.

(19) The State agency shall adopt policies that

(A) require each local agency to attempt to contact each pregnant woman who misses an appointment to apply for participation in the program under this section, in order to reschedule the appointment, unless the phone number and the address of the woman are unavailable to such local agency; and

(B) in the case of local agencies that do not routinely schedule appointments for individuals seeking to apply or be recertified for participation in the program under this section, require each such local agency to schedule appointments for each employed individual seeking to apply or be recertified for participation in such program so as to minimize the time each such individual is absent from the workplace due to such application or request for recertification.

(20) Each State agency shall conduct monitoring reviews of each local agency at least biennially.

(21) Use of claims from local agencies, vendors, and participants .

A State agency may use funds recovered from local agencies, vendors, and participants, as a result of a claim arising under the program, to carry out the program during

(A) the fiscal year in which the claim arises;

(B) the fiscal year in which the funds are collected; and

(C) the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds are collected.

(22) The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall carry out an initiative to assure that, in a case in which a State medicaid program uses coordinated care providers under a contract entered into under section 1903(m), or a waiver granted under section 1915(b), of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396b(m) or 1396n(b)), coordination between the program authorized by this section and the medicaid program is continued, including

(A) the referral of potentially eligible women, infants, and children between the 2 programs; and

(B) the timely provision of medical information related to the program authorized by this section to agencies carrying out the program.

(23) Individuals participating at more than one site .

Each State agency shall implement a system designed by the State agency to identify individuals who are participating at more than one site under the program.

(24) High risk vendors .

Each State agency shall

(A) identify vendors that have a high probability of program abuse; and

(B) conduct compliance investigations of the vendors.

(25) Infant formula benefits .

A State agency may round up to the next whole can of infant formula to allow all participants under the program to receive the full-authorized nutritional benefit specified by regulation.

(26) Notification of violations .

If a State agency finds that a vendor has committed a violation that requires a pattern of occurrences in order to impose a penalty or sanction, the State agency shall notify the vendor of the initial violation in writing prior to documentation of another violation, unless the State agency determines that notifying the vendor would compromise an investigation.
