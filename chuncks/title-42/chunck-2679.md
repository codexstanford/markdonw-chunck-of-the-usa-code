##### (b) Considerations in making grants

(1) Requirement of status as grantee under part B of subchapter XVII

The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) to a public entity only if

(A) in the case of a public entity that is a State, the State is a grantee under section 300x of this title ;

(B) in the case of a public entity that is a political subdivision of a State, the State in which the political subdivision is located is such a grantee; and

(C) in the case of a public entity that is an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the State in which the tribe or tribal organization is located is such a grantee.

(2) Requirement of status as medicaid provider

(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) only if, in the case of any service under such subsection that is covered in the State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] for the State involved

(i) the public entity involved will provide the service directly, and the entity has entered into a participation agreement under the State plan and is qualified to receive payments under such plan; or

(ii) the public entity will enter into an agreement with an organization under which the organization will provide the service, and the organization has entered into such a participation agreement and is qualified to receive such payments.

(B)

(i) In the case of an organization making an agreement under subparagraph (A)(ii) regarding the provision of services under subsection (a), the requirement established in such subparagraph regarding a participation agreement shall be waived by the Secretary if the organization does not, in providing health or mental health services, impose a charge or accept reimbursement available from any third-party payor, including reimbursement under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State health benefits program.

(ii) A determination by the Secretary of whether an organization referred to in clause (i) meets the criteria for a waiver under such clause shall be made without regard to whether the organization accepts voluntary donations regarding the provision of services to the public.

(3) Certain considerations

In making grants under subsection (a), the Secretary shall

(A) equitably allocate such assistance among the principal geographic regions of the United States;

(B) consider the extent to which the public entity involved has a need for the grant; and

(C) in the case of any public entity that is a political subdivision of a State or that is an Indian tribe or tribal organization

(i) shall consider any comments regarding the application of the entity for such a grant that are received by the Secretary from the State in which the entity is located; and

(ii) shall give special consideration to the entity if the State agrees to provide a portion of the non-Federal contributions required in subsection (c) regarding such a grant.
