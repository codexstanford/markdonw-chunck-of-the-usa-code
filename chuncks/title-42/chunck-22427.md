### CHAPTER 152— ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY
#### § 17086. Advanced integration of buildings onto the electric grid
##### (a) In general

The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, and demonstration to enable components of commercial and residential buildings to serve as dynamic energy loads on and resources for the electric grid. The program shall focus on

(1) developing low-cost, low power, wireless sensors to

(A) monitor building energy load;

(B) forecast building energy need; and

(C) enable building-level energy control;

(2) developing data management capabilities and standard communication protocols to further interoperability at the building and grid-level;

(3) developing advanced building-level energy management of components through integration of smart technologies, control systems, and data processing, to enable energy efficiency and savings;

(4) optimizing energy consumption at the building level to enable grid stability and resilience;

(5) improving visualization of behind the meter equipment and technologies to provide better insight into the energy needs and energy forecasts of individual buildings;

(6) reducing the cost of key components to accelerate the adoption of smart building technologies;

(7) protecting against cybersecurity threats and addressing security vulnerabilities of building systems or equipment; and

(8) other areas determined appropriate by the Secretary.
