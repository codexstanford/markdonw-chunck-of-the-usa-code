#### § 1395w–3a. Use of average sales price payment methodology
##### (e) Authority to use alternative payment in response to public health emergency

In the case of a public health emergency under section 247d of this title in which there is a documented inability to access drugs and biologicals, and a concomitant increase in the price, 1 of a drug or biological which is not reflected in the manufacturer’s average sales price for one or more quarters, the Secretary may use the wholesale acquisition cost (or other reasonable measure of drug or biological price) instead of the manufacturer’s average sales price for such quarters and for subsequent quarters until the price and availability of the drug or biological has stabilized and is substantially reflected in the applicable manufacturer’s average sales price.
