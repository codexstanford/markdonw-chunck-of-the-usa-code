### CHAPTER 13A— CHILD NUTRITION
#### § 1786. Special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children
##### (m) Women, infants, and children farmers’ market nutrition program; establishment, grants, etc.

(1) Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for the purposes of this subsection, and as specified in this subsection, the Secretary shall award grants to States that submit State plans that are approved for the establishment or maintenance of programs designed to provide recipients of assistance under subsection (c), or those who are on the waiting list to receive the assistance, with coupons that may be exchanged for fresh, nutritious, unprepared foods at farmers’ markets and (at the option of a State) roadside stands, as defined in the State plans submitted under this subsection.

(2) A grant provided to any State under this subsection shall be provided to the chief executive officer of the State, who shall

(A) designate the appropriate State agency or agencies to administer the program in conjunction with the appropriate nonprofit organizations; and

(B) ensure coordination of the program among the appropriate agencies and organizations.

(3) The Secretary shall not make a grant to any State under this subsection unless the State agrees to provide State, local, or private funds for the program in an amount that is equal to not less than 30 percent of the administrative cost of the program, which may be satisfied from program income or State contributions that are made for similar programs. The Secretary may negotiate with an Indian State agency a lower percentage of matching funds than is required under the preceding sentence, but not lower than 10 percent of the administrative cost of the program, if the Indian State agency demonstrates to the Secretary financial hardship for the affected Indian tribe, band, group, or council.

(4) Subject to paragraph (6), the Secretary shall establish a formula for determining the amount of the grant to be awarded under this subsection to each State for which a State plan is approved under paragraph (6), according to the number of recipients proposed to participate as specified in the State plan. In determining the amount to be awarded to new States, the Secretary shall rank order the State plans according to the criteria of operation set forth in this subsection, and award grants accordingly. The Secretary shall take into consideration the minimum amount needed to fund each approved State plan, and need not award grants to each State that submits a State plan.

(5) Each State that receives a grant under this subsection shall ensure that the program for which the grant is received complies with the following requirements:

(A) Individuals who are eligible to receive Federal benefits under the program shall only be individuals who are receiving assistance under subsection (c), or who are on the waiting list to receive the assistance.

(B) Construction or operation of a farmers’ market may not be carried out using funds

(i) provided under the grant; or

(ii) required to be provided by the State under paragraph (3).

(C) The value of the Federal share of the benefits received by any recipient under the program may not be

(i) less than $10 per year; or

(ii) more than $30 per year.

(D) The coupon issuance process under the program shall be designed to ensure that coupons are targeted to areas with

(i) the highest concentration of eligible individuals;

(ii) the greatest access to farmers’ markets; and

(iii) certain characteristics, in addition to those described in clauses (i) and (ii), that are determined to be relevant by the Secretary and that maximize the availability of benefits to eligible individuals.

(E) The coupon redemption process under the program shall be designed to ensure that the coupons may be

(i) redeemed only by producers authorized by the State to participate in the program; and

(ii) redeemed only to purchase fresh nutritious unprepared food for human consumption.

(F)

(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), the State may use for administration of the program in any fiscal year not more than 17 percent of the total amount of program funds.

(ii) During any fiscal year for which a State receives assistance under this subsection, the Secretary shall permit the State to use not more than 2 percent of total program funds for market development or technical assistance to farmers’ markets if the Secretary determines that the State intends to promote the development of farmers’ markets in socially or economically disadvantaged areas, or remote rural areas, where individuals eligible for participation in the program have limited access to locally grown fruits and vegetables.

(iii) The provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to the use of program funds shall not apply to any funds that a State may contribute in excess of the funds used by the State to meet the requirements of paragraph (3).

(G) The State shall ensure that no State or local taxes are collected within the State on purchases of food with coupons distributed under the program.

(6)

(A) The Secretary shall give the same preference for funding under this subsection to eligible States that participated in the program under this subsection in a prior fiscal year as to States that participated in the program in the most recent fiscal year. The Secretary shall inform each State of the award of funds as prescribed by subparagraph (G) by February 15 of each year.

(B)

(i) Subject to the availability of appropriations, if a State provides the amount of matching funds required under paragraph (3), the State shall receive assistance under this subsection in an amount that is not less than the amount of such assistance that the State received in the most recent fiscal year in which it received such assistance.

(ii) If amounts appropriated for any fiscal year pursuant to the authorization contained in paragraph (10) for grants under this subsection are not sufficient to pay to each State for which a State plan is approved under paragraph (6) the amount that the Secretary determines each such State is entitled to under this subsection, each State’s grant shall be ratably reduced, except that (if sufficient funds are available) each State shall receive at least $75,000 or the amount that the State received for the prior fiscal year if that amount is less than $75,000.
