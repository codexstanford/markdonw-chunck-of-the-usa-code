(ii) particular pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions where more complete knowledge and testing of therapeutics, including drugs and biologics, and identification of biomarkers for such diseases, disorders, or conditions, may be beneficial in pediatric populations; and

(iii) the adequacy of necessary infrastructure to conduct pediatric pharmacological research, including research networks and trained pediatric investigators; and

(B) may consider the availability of qualified countermeasures (as defined in section 247d–6a of this title ), security countermeasures (as defined in section 247d–6b of this title ), and qualified pandemic or epidemic products (as defined in section 247d–6d of this title ) to address the needs of pediatric populations, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, consistent with the purposes of this section.
