######## (A) If

(i) a provider of services or supplier follows the written guidance (which may be transmitted electronically) provided by the Secretary or by a medicare contractor (as defined in section 1395zz(g) of this title ) acting within the scope of the contractor’s contract authority, with respect to the furnishing of items or services and submission of a claim for benefits for such items or services with respect to such provider or supplier;

(ii) the Secretary determines that the provider of services or supplier has accurately presented the circumstances relating to such items, services, and claim to the contractor in writing; and

(iii) the guidance was in error; the provider of services or supplier shall not be subject to any penalty or interest under this subchapter or the provisions of subchapter XI insofar as they relate to this subchapter (including interest under a repayment plan under section 1395ddd of this title or otherwise) relating to the provision of such items or service or such claim if the provider of services or supplier reasonably relied on such guidance.
