(1) In general

(A) Use of fund

A security countermeasure may, in accordance with this subsection, be procured with amounts in the special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h).

(B) Security countermeasure

For purposes of this subsection, the term “security countermeasure” means a drug (as that term is defined by section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) )), biological product (as that term is defined by section 262(i) of this title ), or device (as that term is defined by section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 321(h) )) that

(i)

(I) the Secretary determines to be a priority (consistent with sections 182(2) and 184(a) of title 6) to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from any biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent identified as a material threat under paragraph (2)(A)(ii), or to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from a condition that may result in adverse health consequences or death and may be caused by administering a drug, biological product, or device against such an agent;

(II) the Secretary determines under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) to be a necessary countermeasure; and

(III)

(aa) is approved or cleared under chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.] or licensed under section 262 of this title ; or

(bb) is a countermeasure for which the Secretary determines that sufficient and satisfactory clinical experience or research data (including data, if available, from pre-clinical and clinical trials) support a reasonable conclusion that the countermeasure will qualify for approval or licensing within 10 years after the date of a determination under paragraph (5); or

(ii) is authorized for emergency use under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 360bbb–3 ].

(C) Notice to Congress

The Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall send to Congress, on an annual basis, all current material threat determinations and shall promptly notify the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives that a determination has been made pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B).

(D) Assuring access to threat information

In making the assessment and determination required under subparagraph (A), the Homeland Security Secretary shall use all relevant information to which such Secretary is entitled under section 122 of title 6 , including but not limited to information, regardless of its level of classification, relating to current and emerging threats of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents.

(3) Assessment of availability and appropriateness of countermeasures

(A) In general

The Secretary, in consultation with the Homeland Security Secretary, shall assess on an ongoing basis the availability and appropriateness of specific countermeasures to address specific threats identified under paragraph (2).

(B) Information

The Secretary shall institute a process for making publicly available the results of assessments under subparagraph (A) while withholding such information as

(i) would, in the judgment of the Secretary, tend to reveal public health vulnerabilities; or

(ii) would otherwise be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 .

(4) Call for development of countermeasures; commitment for recommendation for procurement

(A) Proposal to the President

If, pursuant to an assessment under paragraph (3), the Homeland Security Secretary and the Secretary make a determination that a countermeasure would be appropriate but is either currently not developed or unavailable for procurement as a security countermeasure or is approved, licensed, or cleared only for alternative uses, such Secretaries may jointly submit to the President a proposal to

(i) issue a call for the development of such countermeasure; and

(ii) make a commitment that, upon the first development of such countermeasure that meets the conditions for procurement under paragraph (5), the Secretaries will, based in part on information obtained pursuant to such call, and subject to the availability of appropriations, make available the special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h) for procurement of such countermeasure, as applicable.

(B) Countermeasure specifications

The Homeland Security Secretary and the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, include in the proposal under subparagraph (A)

(i) estimated quantity of purchase (in the form of number of doses or number of effective courses of treatments regardless of dosage form);

(ii) necessary measures of minimum safety and effectiveness;

(iii) estimated price for each dose or effective course of treatment regardless of dosage form; and

(iv) other information that may be necessary to encourage and facilitate research, development, and manufacture of the countermeasure or to provide specifications for the countermeasure.

(C) Presidential approval

If the President approves a proposal under subparagraph (A), the Homeland Security Secretary and the Secretary shall make known to persons who may respond to a call for the countermeasure involved

(i) the call for the countermeasure;

(5) Secretary’s determination of countermeasures appropriate for funding from special reserve fund

(A) In general

The Secretary, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, shall identify specific security countermeasures that the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Homeland Security Secretary, to be appropriate for inclusion in the stockpile under subsection (a) pursuant to procurements made with amounts in the special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h) (referred to in this subsection individually as a “procurement under this subsection”).

(B) Requirements

In making a determination under subparagraph (A) with respect to a security countermeasure, the Secretary shall determine and consider the following:

(i) The quantities of the product that will be needed to meet the stockpile needs.

(ii) The feasibility of production and delivery within 10 years of sufficient quantities of the product.

(iii) Whether there is a lack of a significant commercial market for the product at the time of procurement, other than as a security countermeasure.

(6) Recommendations for procurement

(A) Notice to appropriate congressional committees

The Secretary shall notify the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives of each decision to make available the special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h) for procurement of a security countermeasure, including, where available, the number of, the nature of, and other information concerning potential suppliers of such countermeasure, and whether other potential suppliers of the same or similar countermeasures were considered and rejected for procurement under this section and the reasons for each such rejection.

(B) Subsequent specific countermeasures

Procurement under this subsection of a security countermeasure for a particular purpose does not preclude the subsequent procurement under this subsection of any other security countermeasure for such purpose if the Secretary has determined under paragraph (5)(A) that such countermeasure is appropriate for inclusion in the stockpile and if, as determined by the Secretary, such countermeasure provides improved safety or effectiveness, or for other reasons enhances preparedness to respond to threats of use of a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent. Such a determination by the Secretary is committed to agency discretion.

(7) Procurement

(A) Payments from special reserve fund

The special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h) shall be available for payments made by the Secretary to a vendor for procurement of a security countermeasure in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.

(B) Procurement

(i) In general

The Secretary shall be responsible for

(I) arranging for procurement of a security countermeasure, including negotiating terms (including quantity, production schedule, and price) of, and entering into, contracts and cooperative agreements, and for carrying out such other activities as may reasonably be required, including advanced research and development, in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph; and

(II) promulgating such regulations as the Secretary determines necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection.

(ii) Contract terms

A contract for procurements under this subsection shall (or, as specified below, may) include the following terms:

(I) Payment conditioned on delivery

The contract shall provide that no payment may be made until delivery of a portion, acceptable to the Secretary, of the total number of units contracted for, except that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the contract may provide that, if the Secretary determines (in the Secretary’s discretion) that an advance payment, partial payment for significant milestones, or payment to increase manufacturing capacity is necessary to ensure success of a project, the Secretary shall pay an amount, not to exceed 10 percent of the contract amount, in advance of delivery. The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, make the determination of advance payment at the same time as the issuance of a solicitation. The contract shall provide that such advance payment is required to be repaid if there is a failure to perform by the vendor under the contract. The contract may also provide for additional advance payments of 5 percent each for meeting the milestones specified in such contract, except that such payments shall not exceed 50 percent of the total contract amount. If the specified milestones are reached, the advanced payments of 5 percent shall not be required to be repaid. Nothing in this subclause shall be construed as affecting the rights of vendors under provisions of law or regulation (including the Federal Acquisition Regulation) relating to the termination of contracts for the convenience of the Government.

(II) Discounted payment

The contract may provide for a discounted price per unit of a product that is not licensed, cleared, or approved as described in paragraph (1)(B)(i)(III)(aa) at the time of delivery, and may provide for payment of an additional amount per unit if the product becomes so licensed, cleared, or approved before the expiration date of the contract (including an additional amount per unit of product delivered before the effective date of such licensing, clearance, or approval).

(III) Contract duration

The contract shall be for a period not to exceed five years, except that, in first awarding the contract, the Secretary may provide for a longer duration, not exceeding 10 years, if the Secretary determines that complexities or other difficulties in performance under the contract justify such a period. The contract shall be renewable for additional periods, none of which shall exceed five years. The Secretary shall notify the vendor within 90 days of a determination by the Secretary to renew, extend, or terminate such contract.

(IV) Storage by vendor

The contract may provide that the vendor will provide storage for stocks of a product delivered to the ownership of the Federal Government under the contract, for such period and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may specify, and in such case amounts from the special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h) shall be available for costs of shipping, handling, storage, and related costs for such product.

(V) Product approval

The contract shall provide that the vendor seek approval, clearance, or licensing of the product from the Secretary; for a timetable for the development of data and other information to support such approval, clearance, or licensing; and that the Secretary may waive part or all of this contract term on request of the vendor or on the initiative of the Secretary.

(VI) Non-stockpile transfers of security countermeasures

The contract shall provide that the vendor will comply with all applicable export-related controls with respect to such countermeasure.

(VII) Sales exclusivity

The contract may provide that the vendor is the exclusive supplier of the product to the Federal Government for a specified period of time, not to exceed the term of the contract, on the condition that the vendor is able to satisfy the needs of the Government. During the agreed period of sales exclusivity, the vendor shall not assign its rights of sales exclusivity to another entity or entities without approval by the Secretary. Such a sales exclusivity provision in such a contract shall constitute a valid basis for a sole source procurement under section 3304(a)(1) of title 41 .

(VIII) Warm based surge capacity

The contract may provide that the vendor establish domestic manufacturing capacity of the product to ensure that additional production of the product is available in the event that the Secretary determines that there is a need to quickly purchase additional quantities of the product. Such contract may provide a fee to the vendor for establishing and maintaining such capacity in excess of the initial requirement for the purchase of the product. Additionally, the cost of maintaining the domestic manufacturing capacity shall be an allowable and allocable direct cost of the contract.

(IX) Contract terms

The Secretary, in any contract for procurement under this section

(aa) may specify

(AA) the dosing and administration requirements for the countermeasure to be developed and procured;

(BB) the amount of funding that will be dedicated by the Secretary for advanced research, development, and procurement of the countermeasure; and

(CC) the specifications the countermeasure must meet to qualify for procurement under a contract under this section; and

(bb) shall provide a clear statement of defined Government purpose limited to uses related to a security countermeasure, as defined in paragraph (1)(B).

(iii) Availability of simplified acquisition procedures

(I) In general

If the Secretary determines that there is a pressing need for a procurement of a specific countermeasure, the amount of the procurement under this subsection shall be deemed to be below the threshold amount specified in section 134 of title 41 , for purposes of application to such procurement, pursuant to section 3101(b)(1)(A) of title 41 , of

(aa) section 3305(a)(1) of title 41 and its implementing regulations; and

(bb) section 3101(b)(1)(B) of title 41 and its implementing regulations.

(II) Application of certain provisions

Notwithstanding subclause (I) and the provision of law and regulations referred to in such clause, each of the following provisions shall apply to procurements described in this clause to the same extent that such provisions would apply to such procurements in the absence of subclause (I):

(aa) Chapter 37 of title 40 (relating to contract work hours and safety standards).

(bb) Section 8703(a) of title 41 .

(cc) Section 4706 of title 41 (relating to the examination of contractor records).

The Secretary shall establish appropriate internal controls for procurements made under this clause, including requirements with respect to documentation of the justification for the use of the authority provided under this paragraph with respect to the procurement involved.

(IV) Authority to limit competition

In conducting a procurement under this subparagraph, the Secretary may not use the authority provided for under subclause (I) to conduct a procurement on a basis other than full and open competition unless the Secretary determines that the mission of the BioShield Program under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 would be seriously impaired without such a limitation.

(iv) Procedures other than full and open competition

(I) In general

In using the authority provided in section 3304(a)(1) of title 41 to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the case of a procurement under this subsection, the phrase “available from only one responsible source” in such section 3304(a)(1) shall be deemed to mean “available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources”.

(II) Relation to other authorities

The authority under subclause (I) is in addition to any other authority to use procedures other than competitive procedures.

(III) Applicable government-wide regulations

The Secretary shall implement this clause in accordance with government-wide regulations implementing such section 3304(a)(1) (including requirements that offers be solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances, that required notices be published, and that submitted offers be considered), as such regulations apply to procurements for which an agency has authority to use procedures other than competitive procedures when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.

(v) Premium provision in multiple award contracts

(I) In general

If, under this subsection, the Secretary enters into contracts with more than one vendor to procure a security countermeasure, such Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, include in each of such contracts a provision that

(aa) identifies an increment of the total quantity of security countermeasure required, whether by percentage or by numbers of units; and

(bb) promises to pay one or more specified premiums based on the priority of such vendors’ production and delivery of the increment identified under item (aa), in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.

(II) Determination of Government’s requirement not reviewable

If the Secretary includes in each of a set of contracts a provision as described in subclause (I), such Secretary’s determination of the total quantity of security countermeasure required, and any amendment of such determination, is committed to agency discretion.

(vi) Extension of closing date for receipt of proposals not reviewable

A decision by the Secretary to extend the closing date for receipt of proposals for a procurement under this subsection is committed to agency discretion.

(vii) Limiting competition to sources responding to request for information

In conducting a procurement under this subsection, the Secretary may exclude a source that has not responded to a request for information under section 3306(a)(1)(B) of title 41 if such request has given notice that the Secretary may so exclude such a source.

(viii) Flexibility

In carrying out this section, the Secretary may, consistent with the applicable provisions of this section, enter into contracts and other agreements that are in the best interest of the Government in meeting identified security countermeasure needs, including with respect to reimbursement of the cost of advanced research and development as a reasonable, allowable, and allocable direct cost of the contract involved.

(8) Interagency cooperation

(A) In general

In carrying out activities under this section, the Homeland Security Secretary and the Secretary are authorized, subject to subparagraph (B), to enter into interagency agreements and other collaborative undertakings with other agencies of the United States Government. Such agreements may allow other executive agencies to order qualified and security countermeasures under procurement contracts or other agreements established by the Secretary. Such ordering process (including transfers of appropriated funds between an agency and the Department of Health and Human Services as reimbursements for such orders for countermeasures) may be conducted under the authority of section 1535 of title 31 , except that all such orders shall be processed under the terms established under this subsection for the procurement of countermeasures.

(B) Limitation

An agreement or undertaking under this paragraph shall not authorize another agency to exercise the authorities provided by this section to the Homeland Security Secretary or to the Secretary.
