For the purpose of carrying out this section, there is authorized to be appropriated $685,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023 for awards pursuant to paragraph (3) (subject to the authority of the Secretary to make awards pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5)).

(B) Requirement for State matching funds

Beginning in fiscal year 2009, in the case of any State or consortium of two or more States, the Secretary may not award a cooperative agreement under this section unless the State or consortium of States agree that, with respect to the amount of the cooperative agreement awarded by the Secretary, the State or consortium of States will make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions in an amount equal to

(i) for the first fiscal year of the cooperative agreement, not less than 5 percent of such costs ($1 for each $20 of Federal funds provided in the cooperative agreement); and

(ii) for any second fiscal year of the cooperative agreement, and for any subsequent fiscal year of such cooperative agreement, not less than 10 percent of such costs ($1 for each $10 of Federal funds provided in the cooperative agreement).

(C) Determination of amount of non-Federal contributions

As determined by the Secretary, non-Federal contributions required in subparagraph (B) may be provided directly or through donations from public or private entities and may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment or services. Amounts provided by the Federal government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.

(2) Maintaining State funding

(A) In general

An entity that receives an award under this section shall maintain expenditures for public health security at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the entity for the preceding 2 year period.

(B) Rule of construction

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the use of awards under this section to pay salary and related expenses of public health and other professionals employed by State, local, or tribal public health agencies who are carrying out activities supported by such awards (regardless of whether the primary assignment of such personnel is to carry out such activities).

(3) Determination of amount

(A) In general

The Secretary shall award cooperative agreements under subsection (a) to each State or consortium of 2 or more States that submits to the Secretary an application that meets the criteria of the Secretary for the receipt of such an award and that meets other implementation conditions established by the Secretary for such awards.

(B) Base amount

In determining the amount of an award pursuant to subparagraph (A) for a State, the Secretary shall first determine an amount the Secretary considers appropriate for the State (referred to in this paragraph as the “base amount”), except that such amount may not be greater than the minimum amount determined under subparagraph (D).

(C) Increase on basis of population

After determining the base amount for a State under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall increase the base amount by an amount equal to the product of

(i) the amount appropriated under paragraph (1)(A) for the fiscal year, less an amount equal to the sum of all base amounts determined for the States under subparagraph (B), and less the amount, if any, reserved by the Secretary under paragraphs (4) and (5); and

(ii) subject to paragraph (4)(C), the percentage constituted by the ratio of an amount equal to the population of the State over an amount equal to the total population of the States (as indicated by the most recent data collected by the Bureau of the Census).

(D) Minimum amount

Subject to the amount appropriated under paragraph (1)(A), an award pursuant to subparagraph (A) for a State shall be the greater of the base amount as increased under subparagraph (C), or the minimum amount under this subparagraph. The minimum amount under this subparagraph is

(i) in the case of each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, an amount equal to the lesser of

(I) $5,000,000; or

(II) if the amount appropriated under paragraph (1)(A) is less than $667,000,000, an amount equal to 0.75 percent of the amount appropriated under such paragraph, less the amount, if any, reserved by the Secretary under paragraphs (4) and (5); or

(ii) in the case of each of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands, an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, except that such amount may not exceed the amount determined under clause (i).

(4) Certain political subdivisions

(A) In general

For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, before making awards pursuant to paragraph (3) for such year, reserve from the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for the year an amount determined necessary by the Secretary to make awards under subsection (a) to political subdivisions that have a substantial number of residents, have a substantial local infrastructure for responding to public health emergencies, and face a high degree of risk from bioterrorist attacks or other public health emergencies. Not more than three political subdivisions may receive awards pursuant to this subparagraph.

(B) Coordination with Statewide plans

An award pursuant to subparagraph (A) may not be made unless the application of the political subdivision involved is in coordination with, and consistent with, applicable Statewide plans described in subsection (b).

(C) Relationship to formula grants

In the case of a State that will receive an award pursuant to paragraph (3), and in which there is located a political subdivision that will receive an award pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, in determining the amount under paragraph (3)(C) for the State, subtract from the population of the State an amount equal to the population of such political subdivision.

(D) Continuity of funding

In determining whether to make an award pursuant to subparagraph (A) to a political subdivision, the Secretary may consider, as a factor indicating that the award should be made, that the political subdivision received public health funding from the Secretary for fiscal year 2006.

(5) Significant unmet needs; degree of risk

(A) In general

For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, before making awards pursuant to paragraph (3) for such year, reserve from the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for the year an amount determined necessary by the Secretary to make awards under subsection (a) to eligible entities that

(i) have a significant need for funds to build capacity to identify, detect, monitor, and respond to a bioterrorist or other threat to the public health, which need will not be met by awards pursuant to paragraph (3); and

(ii) face a particularly high degree of risk of such a threat.

(B) Recipients of grants

Awards pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be supplemental awards to States that receive awards pursuant to paragraph (3), or may be awards to eligible entities described in subsection (b)(1)(B) within such States.

(C) Finding with respect to District of Columbia

The Secretary shall consider the District of Columbia to have a significant unmet need for purposes of subparagraph (A), and to face a particularly high degree of risk for such purposes, on the basis of the concentration of entities of national significance located within the District.

(6) Funding of local entities

The Secretary shall, in making awards under this section, ensure that with respect to the cooperative agreement awarded, the entity make available appropriate portions of such award to political subdivisions and local departments of public health through a process involving the consensus, approval or concurrence with such local entities.

(7) Availability of cooperative agreement funds

Amounts provided to an eligible entity under a cooperative agreement under subsection (a) for a fiscal year and remaining unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such entity for the next fiscal year for the purposes for which such funds were provided.
