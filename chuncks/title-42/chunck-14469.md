##### (k) Standards for water closets and urinals
######## (A) If the maximum flush volume requirements of ASME Standard A112.19.6–1990 are amended to improve the efficiency of water use of any low consumption water closet or low consumption urinal and are approved by ANSI, the Secretary shall, not later than 12 months after the date of such amendment, publish a final rule establishing an amended uniform national standard for that product at the level specified in amended ASME/ANSI Standard A112.19.6 and providing that such standard shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is one year after the publication of such rule, unless the Secretary determines, by rule published in the Federal Register, that adoption of a uniform national standard at the level specified in such amended ASME/ANSI Standard A112.19.6
######### (i) As part of the rulemaking conducted under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall also determine if adoption of a uniform national standard for any type or class of low consumption water closet or low consumption urinal more stringent than such amended ASME/ANSI Standard A112.19.6 for such product

(I) would result in additional conservation of energy or water;
