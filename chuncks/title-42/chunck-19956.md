##### (b) Grants

The Corporation shall establish a Nonprofit Capacity Building Program to make grants to intermediary nonprofit organizations to serve as intermediary nonprofit grantees. The Corporation shall make the grants to enable the intermediary nonprofit grantees to pay for the Federal share of the cost of delivering organizational development assistance, including training on best practices, financial planning, grantwriting, and compliance with the applicable tax laws, for small and midsize nonprofit organizations, especially those nonprofit organizations facing resource hardship challenges. Each of the grantees shall match the grant funds by providing a non-Federal share as described in subsection (f).
