### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–115. Subsidies for part D eligible individuals for qualified prescription drug coverage
##### (c) Adjustments relating to bids

(1) Health status risk adjustment

(A) Establishment of risk adjustors

The Secretary shall establish an appropriate methodology for adjusting the standardized bid amount under subsection (a)(1)(A) to take into account variation in costs for basic prescription drug coverage among prescription drug plans and MA–PD plans based on the differences in actuarial risk of different enrollees being served. Any such risk adjustment shall be designed in a manner so as not to result in a change in the aggregate amounts payable to such plans under subsection (a)(1) and through that portion of the monthly beneficiary prescription drug premiums described in subsection (a)(1)(B) and MA monthly prescription drug beneficiary premiums.

(B) Considerations

In establishing the methodology under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may take into account the similar methodologies used under section 1395w–23(a)(3) of this title to adjust payments to MA organizations for benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option.

(C) Data collection

In order to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary shall require

(i) PDP sponsors to submit data regarding drug claims that can be linked at the individual level to part A and part B data and such other information as the Secretary determines necessary; and

(ii) MA organizations that offer MA–PD plans to submit data regarding drug claims that can be linked at the individual level to other data that such organizations are required to submit to the Secretary and such other information as the Secretary determines necessary.

(D) Publication

At the time of publication of risk adjustment factors under section 1395w–23(b)(1)(B)(i)(II) of this title , the Secretary shall publish the risk adjusters established under this paragraph for the succeeding year.

(2) Geographic adjustment

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), for purposes of section 1395w–113(a)(1)(B)(iii) of this title , the Secretary shall establish an appropriate methodology for adjusting the national average monthly bid amount (computed under section 1395w–113(a)(4) of this title ) to take into account differences in prices for covered part D drugs among PDP regions.

(B) De minimis rule

If the Secretary determines that the price variations described in subparagraph (A) among PDP regions are de minimis, the Secretary shall not provide for adjustment under this paragraph.

(C) Budget neutral adjustment

Any adjustment under this paragraph shall be applied in a manner so as to not result in a change in the aggregate payments made under this part that would have been made if the Secretary had not applied such adjustment.
