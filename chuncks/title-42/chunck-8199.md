##### (g) Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program

(1) Expansion of Program

(A) In general

The Secretary shall enter into contracts with eligible entities or otherwise for the purpose of ensuring that, beginning with 2006, the Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program (commonly referred to as the “Medi-Medi Program”) is conducted with respect to the program established under this subchapter and State Medicaid programs under subchapter XIX for the purpose of

(i) identifying program vulnerabilities in the program established under this subchapter and the Medicaid program established under subchapter XIX through the use of computer algorithms to review claims data to look for payment anomalies (including billing or billing patterns identified with respect to provider, service, time, or patient that appear to be suspect or otherwise implausible);

(ii) working with States, the Attorney General, and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate appropriate actions to investigate and recover amounts with respect to suspect claims to protect the Federal and State share of expenditures under the Medicaid program under subchapter XIX, as well as the program established under this subchapter;

(iii) increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of both such programs through cost avoidance, savings, and recoupments of fraudulent, wasteful, or abusive expenditures; and

(iv) furthering the Secretary’s design, development, installation, or enhancement of an automated data system architecture

(I) to collect, integrate, and assess data for purposes of program integrity, program oversight, and administration, including the Medi-Medi Program; and

(II) that improves the coordination of requests for data from States.

(B) Reporting requirements

The Secretary shall make available in a timely manner any data and statistical information collected by the Medi-Medi Program to the Attorney General, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the States (including a Medicaid fraud and abuse control unit described in section 1396b(q) of this title ). Such information shall be disseminated no less frequently than quarterly.

(2) Limited waiver authority

The Secretary shall waive only such requirements of this section and of subchapters XI and XIX as are necessary to carry out paragraph (1).

(3) Incentives for States

The Secretary shall study and, as appropriate, may specify incentives for States to work with the Secretary for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii). The application of the previous sentence may include use of the waiver authority described in paragraph (2).
