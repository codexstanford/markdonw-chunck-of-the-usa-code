(C) hold one or more public hearings to obtain the views of citizens on community development and housing needs;

Any final statement of activities may be modified or amended from time to time by the grantee in accordance with the same procedures required in this paragraph for the preparation and submission of such statement.

(3) A grant under section 5306 of this title may be made only if the grantee certifies that it is following a detailed citizen participation plan which

(A) provides for and encourages citizen participation, with particular emphasis on participation by persons of low and moderate income who are residents of slum and blight areas and of areas in which section 106 [ 42 U.S.C. 5306 ] funds are proposed to be used, and in the case of a grantee described in section 5306(a) of this title , provides for participation of residents in low and moderate income neighborhoods as defined by the local jurisdiction;
