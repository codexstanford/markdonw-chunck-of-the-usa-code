#### § 1962–3. Water resources principles and guidelines
##### (a) National water resources planning policy

It is the policy of the United States that all water resources projects should reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment by

(1) seeking to maximize sustainable economic development;

(2) seeking to avoid the unwise use of floodplains and flood-prone areas and minimizing adverse impacts and vulnerabilities in any case in which a floodplain or flood-prone area must be used; and

(3) protecting and restoring the functions of natural systems and mitigating any unavoidable damage to natural systems.
