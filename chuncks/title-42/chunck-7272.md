(A) Prior authorization medical review

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall use prior authorization medical review for services described in paragraph (1) that are furnished to an individual by a chiropractor described in section 1395x(r)(5) of this title that are part of an episode of treatment that includes more than 12 services. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an episode of treatment shall be determined by the underlying cause that justifies the need for services, such as a diagnosis code.

(ii) Ending application of prior authorization medical review

The Secretary shall end the application of prior authorization medical review under clause (i) to services described in paragraph (1) by such a chiropractor if the Secretary determines that the chiropractor has a low denial rate under such prior authorization medical review. The Secretary may subsequently reapply prior authorization medical review to such chiropractor if the Secretary determines it to be appropriate and the chiropractor has, in the time period subsequent to the determination by the Secretary of a low denial rate with respect to the chiropractor, furnished such services described in paragraph (1).

(iii) Early request for prior authorization review permitted

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent such a chiropractor from requesting prior authorization for services described in paragraph (1) that are to be furnished to an individual before the chiropractor furnishes the twelfth such service to such individual for an episode of treatment.

(B) Type of review

The Secretary may use pre-payment review or post-payment review of services described in section 1395x(r)(5) of this title that are not subject to prior authorization medical review under subparagraph (A).

(C) Relationship to law enforcement activities

The Secretary may determine that medical review under this subsection does not apply in the case where potential fraud may be involved.

(3) No payment without prior authorization

With respect to a service described in paragraph (1) for which prior authorization medical review under this subsection applies, the following shall apply:

(A) Prior authorization determination

The Secretary shall make a determination, prior to the service being furnished, of whether the service would or would not meet the applicable requirements of section 1395y(a)(1)(A) of this title .

(B) Denial of payment

Subject to paragraph (5), no payment may be made under this part for the service unless the Secretary determines pursuant to subparagraph (A) that the service would meet the applicable requirements of such section 1395y(a)(1)(A) of this title .

(4) Submission of information

A chiropractor described in section 1395x(r)(5) of this title may submit the information necessary for medical review by fax, by mail, or by electronic means. The Secretary shall make available the electronic means described in the preceding sentence as soon as practicable.

(5) Timeliness

If the Secretary does not make a prior authorization determination under paragraph (3)(A) within 14 business days of the date of the receipt of medical documentation needed to make such determination, paragraph (3)(B) shall not apply.

(6) Application of limitation on beneficiary liability

Where payment may not be made as a result of the application of paragraph (2)(B), section 1395pp of this title shall apply in the same manner as such section applies to a denial that is made by reason of section 1395y(a)(1) of this title .

(7) Review by contractors

The medical review described in paragraph (2) may be conducted by medicare administrative contractors pursuant to section 1395kk–1(a)(4)(G) of this title or by any other contractor determined appropriate by the Secretary that is not a recovery audit contractor.

(8) Multiple services

The Secretary shall, where practicable, apply the medical review under this subsection in a manner so as to allow an individual described in paragraph (1) to obtain, at a single time rather than on a service-by-service basis, an authorization in accordance with paragraph (3)(A) for multiple services.

(9) Construction

With respect to a service described in paragraph (1) that has been affirmed by medical review under this subsection, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the subsequent denial of a claim for such service that does not meet other applicable requirements under this chapter.

(10) Implementation

(A) Authority

The Secretary may implement the provisions of this subsection by interim final rule with comment period.

(B) Administration

Chapter 35 of title 44 shall not apply to medical review under this subsection.
