### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 410. Definitions relating to employment
##### (l) Service in uniformed services

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the term “employment” shall, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, include

(A) service performed after December 1956 by an individual as a member of a uniformed service on active duty, but such term shall not include any such service which is performed while on leave without pay, and

(B) service performed after December 1987 by an individual as a member of a uniformed service on inactive duty training.

(2) The term “active duty” means “active duty” as described in paragraph (21) of section 101 of title 38 , except that it shall also include “active duty for training” as described in paragraph (22) of such section.

(3) The term “inactive duty training” means “inactive duty training” as described in paragraph (23) of such section 101.

(4)

(A) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply in the case of any service, performed by an individual as a member of a uniformed service, which is creditable under section 231b(i) of title 45 . The Railroad Retirement Board shall notify the Commissioner of Social Security, 3 with respect to all such service which is so creditable.

(B) In any case where benefits under this subchapter are already payable on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income at the time such notification (with respect to such individual) is received by the Commissioner of Social Security, the Commissioner of Social Security shall certify no further benefits for payment under this subchapter on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income, or shall recompute the amount of any further benefits payable on the basis of such wages and self-employment income, as may be required as a consequence of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. No payment of a benefit to any person on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income, certified by the Commissioner of Social Security prior to the end of the month in which the Commissioner receives such notification from the Railroad Retirement Board, shall be deemed by reason of this subparagraph to have been an erroneous payment or a payment to which such person was not entitled. The Commissioner of Social Security shall, as soon as possible after the receipt of such notification from the Railroad Retirement Board, advise such Board whether or not any such benefit will be reduced or terminated by reason of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, and if any such benefit will be so reduced or terminated, specify the first month with respect to which such reduction or termination will be effective.
