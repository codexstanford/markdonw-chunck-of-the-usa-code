#### § 4104c. Mitigation assistance
##### (c) Eligible mitigation activities

(1) Requirement of consistency with approved mitigation plan

Amounts provided under this section may be used only for mitigation activities that are consistent with mitigation plans that are approved by the Administrator and identified under paragraph (4). The Administrator shall provide assistance under this section to the extent amounts are available in the National Flood Mitigation Fund pursuant to appropriation Acts, subject only to the absence of approvable mitigation plans.

(2) Requirements of technical feasibility, cost effectiveness, and interest of National Flood Insurance Fund

(A) In general

The Administrator may approve only mitigation activities that the Administrator determines

(i) are technically feasible and cost-effective; or

(ii) will eliminate future payments from the National Flood Insurance Fund for severe repetitive loss structures through an acquisition or relocation activity.

(B) Considerations

In making a determination under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall take into consideration recognized ancillary benefits.

(3) Eligible activities

Eligible activities under a mitigation plan may include

(A) demolition or relocation of any structure located on land that is along the shore of a lake or other body of water and is certified by an appropriate State or local land use authority to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or flooding;

(B) elevation, relocation, demolition, or floodproofing of structures (including public structures) located in areas having special flood hazards or other areas of flood risk;

(C) acquisition by States and communities of properties (including public properties) located in areas having special flood hazards or other areas of flood risk and properties substantially damaged by flood, for public use, as the Administrator determines is consistent with sound land management and use in such area;

(D) elevation, relocation, or floodproofing of utilities (including equipment that serves structures);

(E) minor physical mitigation efforts that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of other Federal agencies and that lessen the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood damages, which shall not include major flood control projects such as dikes, levees, seawalls, groins, and jetties unless the Administrator specifically determines in approving a mitigation plan that such activities are the most cost-effective mitigation activities for the National Flood Mitigation Fund;

(F) the development or update of mitigation plans by a State or community which meet the planning criteria established by the Administrator, except that the amount from grants under this section that may be used under this subparagraph may not exceed $50,000 for any mitigation plan of a State or $25,000 for any mitigation plan of a community;

(G) the provision of technical assistance by States to communities and individuals to conduct eligible mitigation activities;

(H) other activities that the Administrator considers appropriate and specifies in regulation;

(I) other mitigation activities not described in subparagraphs (A) through (G) or the regulations issued under subparagraph (H), that are described in the mitigation plan of a State or community; and

(J) without regard to the requirements under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d), and if the State applied for and was awarded at least $1,000,000 in grants available under this section in the prior fiscal year, technical assistance to communities to identify eligible activities, to develop grant applications, and to implement grants awarded under this section, not to exceed $50,000 to any 1 State in any fiscal year.

(4) Eligibility of demolition and rebuilding of properties

The Administrator shall consider as an eligible activity the demolition and rebuilding of properties to at least base flood elevation or greater, if required by the Administrator or if required by any State regulation or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator.
