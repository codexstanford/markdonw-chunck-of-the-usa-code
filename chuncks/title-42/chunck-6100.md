#### § 673. Adoption and guardianship assistance program
##### (a) Agreements with adoptive parents of children with special needs; State payments; qualifying children; amount of payments; changes in circumstances; placement period prior to adoption; nonrecurring adoption expenses
######## (C) A child shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph for the purpose of paragraph (1)(B)(ii) if

(i) in the case of a child who is not an applicable child for the fiscal year (as defined in subsection (e)), the child

(I) meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(i)(II);

(II) was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part with respect to a prior adoption;

(III) is available for adoption because

(aa) the prior adoption has been dissolved, and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated; or

(bb) the child’s adoptive parents have died; and

(IV) fails to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A)(i) but would meet such requirements if

(aa) the child were treated as if the child were in the same financial and other circumstances the child was in the last time the child was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part; and

(bb) the prior adoption were treated as never having occurred; or

(ii) in the case of a child who is an applicable child for the fiscal year (as so defined), the child meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), is determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part with respect to a prior adoption (or who would have been determined eligible for such payments had the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 been in effect at the time that such determination would have been made), and is available for adoption because the prior adoption has been dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated or because the child’s adoptive parents have died.

(D) In determining the eligibility for adoption assistance payments of a child in a legal guardianship arrangement described in section 671(a)(28) of this title , the placement of the child with the relative guardian involved and any kinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of the child shall be considered never to have been made.

(3) The amount of the payments to be made in any case under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive parents and the State or local agency administering the program under this section, which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted, and may be readjusted periodically, with the concurrence of the adopting parents (which may be specified in the adoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such circumstances. However, in no case may the amount of the adoption assistance payment made under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) exceed the foster care maintenance payment which would have been paid during the period if the child with respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had been in a foster family home.
