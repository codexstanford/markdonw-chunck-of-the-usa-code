#### § 1395eee. Payments to, and coverage of benefits under, programs of all-inclusive care for elderly (PACE)
##### (d) Payments to PACE providers on capitated basis

(1) In general

In the case of a PACE provider with a PACE program agreement under this section, except as provided in this subsection or by regulations, the Secretary shall make prospective monthly payments of a capitation amount for each PACE program eligible individual enrolled under the agreement under this section in the same manner and from the same sources as payments are made to a Medicare+ÐChoice organization under section 1395w–23 of this title (or, for periods beginning before January 1, 1999 , to an eligible organization under a risk-sharing contract under section 1395mm of this title ). Such payments shall be subject to adjustment in the manner described in section 1395w–23(a)(2) of this title or section 1395mm(a)(1)(E) of this title , as the case may be.

(2) Capitation amount

The capitation amount to be applied under this subsection for a provider for a contract year shall be an amount specified in the PACE program agreement for the year. Such amount shall be based upon payment rates established for purposes of payment under section 1395w–23 of this title (or, for periods before January 1, 1999 , for purposes of risk-sharing contracts under section 1395mm of this title ) and shall be adjusted to take into account the comparative frailty of PACE enrollees and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Such amount under such an agreement shall be computed in a manner so that the total payment level for all PACE program eligible individuals enrolled under a program is less than the projected payment under this subchapter for a comparable population not enrolled under a PACE program.

(3) Capitation rates determined without regard to the phase-out of the indirect costs of medical education from the annual Medicare Advantage capitation rate

Capitation amounts under this subsection shall be determined without regard to the application of section 1395w–23(k)(4) of this title .
