#### § 5308. Guarantee and commitment to guarantee loans for acquisition of property
##### (h) Federal taxation of guaranteed obligations; grants to borrowing entity or agency of taxable obligations for net interest costs, etc.; limitation on amount of grant; assistance to issuer in hardship cases

Obligations guaranteed under this section shall be subject to Federal taxation as provided in subsection (j). The Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, grants, in such amounts as may be approved in appropriations Acts, to or on behalf of the issuing eligible public entity or public agency to cover not to exceed 30 per centum of the net interest cost (including such servicing, underwriting, or other costs as may be specified in regulations of the Secretary) to the borrowing entity or agency of such obligations. The Secretary may also, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, assist the issuer of a note or other obligation guaranteed under this section in the payment of all or a portion of the principal and interest amount due under the note or other obligation, if the Secretary determines that the issuer is unable to pay the amount because of circumstances of extreme hardship beyond the control of the issuer.
