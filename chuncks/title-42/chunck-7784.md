(1) No payment may be made under this subchapter with respect to any item or service (other than an emergency item or service, not including items or services furnished in an emergency room of a hospital) furnished

(A) by an individual or entity during the period when such individual or entity is excluded pursuant to section 1320a–7, 1320a–7a, 1320c–5 or 1395u(j)(2) of this title from participation in the program under this subchapter; or

(2) Where an individual eligible for benefits under this subchapter submits a claim for payment for items or services furnished by an individual or entity excluded from participation in the programs under this subchapter, pursuant to section 1320a–7, 1320a–7a, 1320c–5, 1320c–9 (as in effect on September 2, 1982 ), 1395u(j)(2), 1395y(d) (as in effect on August 18, 1987 ), or 1395cc of this title, and such beneficiary did not know or have reason to know that such individual or entity was so excluded, then, to the extent permitted by this subchapter, and notwithstanding such exclusion, payment shall be made for such items or services.
