### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–22. Benefits and beneficiary protections
##### (d) Access to services

(1) In general

A Medicare+Choice organization offering a Medicare+Choice plan may select the providers from whom the benefits under the plan are provided so long as

(A) the organization makes such benefits available and accessible to each individual electing the plan within the plan service area with reasonable promptness and in a manner which assures continuity in the provision of benefits;

(B) when medically necessary the organization makes such benefits available and accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week;

(C) the plan provides for reimbursement with respect to services which are covered under subparagraphs (A) and (B) and which are provided to such an individual other than through the organization, if

(i) the services were not emergency services (as defined in paragraph (3)), but (I) the services were medically necessary and immediately required because of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition, and (II) it was not reasonable given the circumstances to obtain the services through the organization,

(ii) the services were renal dialysis services and were provided other than through the organization because the individual was temporarily out of the plan’s service area, or

(iii) the services are maintenance care or post-stabilization care covered under the guidelines established under paragraph (2);

(D) the organization provides access to appropriate providers, including credentialed specialists, for medically necessary treatment and services; and

(E) coverage is provided for emergency services (as defined in paragraph (3)) without regard to prior authorization or the emergency care provider’s contractual relationship with the organization.

(2) Guidelines respecting coordination of post-stabilization care

A Medicare+Choice plan shall comply with such guidelines as the Secretary may prescribe relating to promoting efficient and timely coordination of appropriate maintenance and post-stabilization care of an enrollee after the enrollee has been determined to be stable under section 1395dd of this title .

(3) “Emergency services” defined

In this subsection

(A) In general

The term “emergency services” means, with respect to an individual enrolled with an organization, covered inpatient and outpatient services that

(i) are furnished by a provider that is qualified to furnish such services under this subchapter, and

(ii) are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition (as defined in subparagraph (B)).

(B) Emergency medical condition based on prudent layperson

The term “emergency medical condition” means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in

(i) placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy,

(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or

(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

(4) Assuring access to services in Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plans

In addition to any other requirements under this part, in the case of a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan, the organization offering the plan must demonstrate to the Secretary that the organization has sufficient number and range of health care professionals and providers willing to provide services under the terms of the plan. Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), the Secretary shall find that an organization has met such requirement with respect to any category of health care professional or provider if, with respect to that category of provider

(A) the plan has established payment rates for covered services furnished by that category of provider that are not less than the payment rates provided for under part A, part B, or both, for such services, or

(B) the plan has contracts or agreements (other than deemed contracts or agreements under subsection (j)(6)) with a sufficient number and range of providers within such category to meet the access standards in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1), or a combination of both. The previous sentence shall not be construed as restricting the persons from whom enrollees under such a plan may obtain covered benefits, except that, if a plan entirely meets such requirement with respect to a category of health care professional or provider on the basis of subparagraph (B), it may provide for a higher beneficiary copayment in the case of health care professionals and providers of that category who do not have contracts or agreements (other than deemed contracts or agreements under subsection (j)(6)) to provide covered services under the terms of the plan.

(5) Requirement of certain nonemployer Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans to use contracts with providers

(A) In general

For plan year 2011 and subsequent plan years, in the case of a Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plan not described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1395w–27(i) of this title operating in a network area (as defined in subparagraph (B)), the plan shall meet the access standards under paragraph (4) in that area only through entering into written contracts as provided for under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph and not, in whole or in part, through the establishment of payment rates meeting the requirements under subparagraph (A) of such paragraph.

(B) Network area defined

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “network area” means, for a plan year, an area which the Secretary identifies (in the Secretary’s announcement of the proposed payment rates for the previous plan year under section 1395w–23(b)(1)(B) of this title ) as having at least 2 network-based plans (as defined in subparagraph (C)) with enrollment under this part as of the first day of the year in which such announcement is made.

(C) Network-based plan defined

(i) In general

For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term “network-based plan” means

(II) a network-based MSA plan; and

(III) a reasonable cost reimbursement plan under section 1395mm of this title .

(ii) Exclusion of non-network regional PPOS

The term “network-based plan” shall not include an MA regional plan that, with respect to the area, meets access adequacy standards under this part substantially through the authority of section 422.112(a)(1)(ii) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, rather than through written contracts.

(6) Requirement of all employer Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans to use contracts with providers

For plan year 2011 and subsequent plan years, in the case of a Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plan that is described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1395w–27(i) of this title , the plan shall meet the access standards under paragraph (4) only through entering into written contracts as provided for under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph and not, in whole or in part, through the establishment of payment rates meeting the requirements under subparagraph (A) of such paragraph.
