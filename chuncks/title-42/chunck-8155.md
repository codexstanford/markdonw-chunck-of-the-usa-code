(ii) measures that apply to the facility for the performance period for the applicable fiscal year.

(2) Application of measures

(A) In general

The Secretary

(i) shall apply the measure specified under subsection (g)(1) for purposes of the SNF VBP Program; and

(ii) may, with respect to payments for services furnished on or after October 1, 2023 , apply additional measures determined appropriate by the Secretary, which may include measures of functional status, patient safety, care coordination, or patient experience. Subject to the succeeding sentence, in the case that the Secretary applies additional measures under clause (ii), the Secretary shall consider and apply, as appropriate, quality measures specified under section 1395 lll (c)(1) of this title. In no case may the Secretary apply more than 10 measures under this subparagraph.

For purposes of the SNF VBP Program, the Secretary shall apply the measure specified under (g)(2)  1 instead of the measure specified under (g)(1)  1 as soon as practicable.

(3) Performance standards

(A) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish performance standards with respect to the measures applied under paragraph (2) for a performance period for a fiscal year.

(B) Higher of achievement and improvement

The performance standards established under subparagraph (A) shall include levels of achievement and improvement. In calculating the SNF performance score under paragraph (4), the Secretary shall use the higher of either improvement or achievement.

(C) Timing

The Secretary shall establish and announce the performance standards established under subparagraph (A) not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of the performance period for the fiscal year involved.

(4) SNF performance score

(A) In general

The Secretary shall develop a methodology for assessing the total performance of each skilled nursing facility based on performance standards established under paragraph (3) with respect to the measures applied under paragraph (2). Using such methodology, the Secretary shall provide for an assessment (in this subsection referred to as the “SNF performance score”) for each skilled nursing facility for each such performance period.

(B) Ranking of SNF performance scores

The Secretary shall, for the performance period for each fiscal year, rank the SNF performance scores determined under subparagraph (A) from low to high.

(5) Calculation of value-based incentive payments

(A) In general

With respect to a skilled nursing facility, based on the ranking under paragraph (4)(B) for a performance period for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall increase the adjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subsection (e)(4)(G) otherwise applicable to such skilled nursing facility (and after application of paragraph (6)) for services furnished by such facility during such fiscal year by the value-based incentive payment amount under subparagraph (B).

(B) Value-based incentive payment amount

The value-based incentive payment amount for services furnished by a skilled nursing facility in a fiscal year shall be equal to the product of

(i) the adjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subsection (e)(4)(G) otherwise applicable to such skilled nursing facility for such services furnished by the skilled nursing facility during such fiscal year; and

(ii) the value-based incentive payment percentage specified under subparagraph (C) for the skilled nursing facility for such fiscal year.

(C) Value-based incentive payment percentage

(i) In general

The Secretary shall specify a value-based incentive payment percentage for a skilled nursing facility for a fiscal year which may include a zero percentage.

(ii) Requirements

In specifying the value-based incentive payment percentage for each skilled nursing facility for a fiscal year under clause (i), the Secretary shall ensure that

(I) such percentage is based on the SNF performance score of the skilled nursing facility provided under paragraph (4) for the performance period for such fiscal year;

(II) the application of all such percentages in such fiscal year results in an appropriate distribution of value-based incentive payments under subparagraph (B) such that

(aa) skilled nursing facilities with the highest rankings under paragraph (4)(B) receive the highest value-based incentive payment amounts under subparagraph (B);

(bb) skilled nursing facilities with the lowest rankings under paragraph (4)(B) receive the lowest value-based incentive payment amounts under subparagraph (B); and

(cc) in the case of skilled nursing facilities in the lowest 40 percent of the ranking under paragraph (4)(B), the payment rate under subparagraph (A) for services furnished by such facility during such fiscal year shall be less than the payment rate for such services for such fiscal year that would otherwise apply under subsection (e)(4)(G) without application of this subsection; and

(III) the total amount of value-based incentive payments under this paragraph for all skilled nursing facilities in such fiscal year shall be greater than or equal to 50 percent, but not greater than 70 percent, of the total amount of the reductions to payments for such fiscal year under paragraph (6), as estimated by the Secretary.

(6) Funding for value-based incentive payments

(A) In general

The Secretary shall reduce the adjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subsection (e)(4)(G) otherwise applicable to a skilled nursing facility for services furnished by such facility during a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2019) by the applicable percent (as defined in subparagraph (B)). The Secretary shall make such reductions for all skilled nursing facilities in the fiscal year involved, regardless of whether or not the skilled nursing facility has been determined by the Secretary to have earned a value-based incentive payment under paragraph (5) for such fiscal year.

(B) Applicable percent

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable percent” means, with respect to fiscal year 2019 and succeeding fiscal years, 2 percent.

(7) Announcement of net result of adjustments

Under the SNF VBP Program, the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days prior to the fiscal year involved, inform each skilled nursing facility of the adjustments to payments to the skilled nursing facility for services furnished by such facility during the fiscal year under paragraphs (5) and (6).

(8) No effect in subsequent fiscal years

The value-based incentive payment under paragraph (5) and the payment reduction under paragraph (6) shall each apply only with respect to the fiscal year involved, and the Secretary shall not take into account such value-based incentive payment or payment reduction in making payments to a skilled nursing facility under this section in a subsequent fiscal year.
