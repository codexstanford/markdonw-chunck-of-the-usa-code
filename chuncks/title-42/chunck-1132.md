(B) Identification

The Secretary, or State or local agency acting on behalf of the Secretary, may conduct inspections only on presenting identification to the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility to be inspected.

(C) Scope of inspection

In conducting inspections, the Secretary or State or local agency acting on behalf of the Secretary

(i) shall have access to all equipment, materials, records, and information that the Secretary or State or local agency considers necessary to determine whether the facility is being operated in accordance with this section; and

(ii) may copy, or require the facility to submit to the Secretary or the State or local agency, any of the materials, records, or information.

(D) Qualifications of inspectors

Qualified individuals, as determined by the Secretary, shall conduct all inspections. The Secretary may request that a State or local agency acting on behalf of the Secretary designate a qualified officer or employee to conduct the inspections, or designate a qualified Federal officer or employee to conduct inspections. The Secretary shall establish minimum qualifications and appropriate training for inspectors and criteria for certification of inspectors in order to inspect facilities for compliance with subsection (f).

(E) Frequency

The Secretary or State or local agency acting on behalf of the Secretary shall conduct inspections under this paragraph of each facility not less often than annually, subject to paragraph (6).

(F) Records and annual reports

The Secretary or a State or local agency acting on behalf of the Secretary which is responsible for inspecting mammography facilities shall maintain records of annual inspections required under this paragraph for a period as prescribed by the Secretary. Such a State or local agency shall annually prepare and submit to the Secretary a report concerning the inspections carried out under this paragraph. Such reports shall include a description of the facilities inspected and the results of such inspections.

(2) Inspection of accredited facilities

The Secretary shall inspect annually a sufficient number of the facilities accredited by an accreditation body to provide the Secretary with a reasonable estimate of the performance of such body.

(3) Inspection of facilities inspected by State or local agencies

(4) Timing

The Secretary, or State or local agency, may conduct inspections under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), during regular business hours or at a mutually agreeable time and after providing such notice as the Secretary may prescribe, except that the Secretary may waive such requirements if the continued performance of mammography at such facility threatens the public health.

(5) Limited reinspection

Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to conduct limited reinspections of facilities found not to be in compliance with this section.

(6) Demonstration program

(A) In general

The Secretary may establish a demonstration program under which inspections under paragraph (1) of selected facilities are conducted less frequently by the Secretary (or as applicable, by State or local agencies acting on behalf of the Secretary) than the interval specified in subparagraph (E) of such paragraph.

(B) Requirements

Any demonstration program under subparagraph (A) shall be carried out in accordance with the following:

(i) The program may not be implemented before April 1, 2001 . Preparations for the program may be carried out prior to such date.

(ii) In carrying out the program, the Secretary may not select a facility for inclusion in the program unless the facility is substantially free of incidents of noncompliance with the standards under subsection (f). The Secretary may at any time provide that a facility will no longer be included in the program.

(iii) The number of facilities selected for inclusion in the program shall be sufficient to provide a statistically significant sample, subject to compliance with clause (ii).

(iv) Facilities that are selected for inclusion in the program shall be inspected at such intervals as the Secretary determines will reasonably ensure that the facilities are maintaining compliance with such standards.
