(A) In general

Not later than 24 months after the date on which an initial standard or implementation specification is adopted or established under sections 1320d–1 and 1320d–2 of this title, each person to whom the standard or implementation specification applies shall comply with the standard or specification.

(B) Special rule for small health plans

In the case of a small health plan, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting “36 months” for “24 months”. For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary shall determine the plans that qualify as small health plans.

If the Secretary adopts a modification to a standard or implementation specification under this part, each person to whom the standard or implementation specification applies shall comply with the modified standard or implementation specification at such time as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into account the time needed to comply due to the nature and extent of the modification. The time determined appropriate under the preceding sentence may not be earlier than the last day of the 180-day period beginning on the date such modification is adopted. The Secretary may extend the time for compliance for small health plans, if the Secretary determines that such extension is appropriate.

(3) Construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit any person from complying with a standard or specification by
