The Secretary shall require such data be submitted with respect to admission and discharge of an individual (and may be submitted more frequently as the Secretary deems appropriate).

(B) Standardized patient assessment data described

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the standardized patient assessment data described in this subparagraph is data required for at least the quality measures described in subsection (c)(1) and that is with respect to the following categories:

(i) Functional status, such as mobility and self care at admission to a PAC provider and before discharge from a PAC provider.

(ii) Cognitive function, such as ability to express ideas and to understand, and mental status, such as depression and dementia.

(iii) Special services, treatments, and interventions, such as need for ventilator use, dialysis, chemotherapy, central line placement, and total parenteral nutrition.

(iv) Medical conditions and co-morbidities, such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, and pressure ulcers.

(v) Impairments, such as incontinence and an impaired ability to hear, see, or swallow.

(vi) Other categories deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary.

(2) Alignment of claims data with standardized patient assessment data

To the extent practicable, not later than October 1, 2018 , for PAC providers described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subsection (a)(2)(A), and January 1, 2019 , for PAC providers described in clause (i) of such subsection, the Secretary shall match claims data with assessment data pursuant to this section for purposes of assessing prior service use and concurrent service use, such as antecedent hospital or PAC provider use, and may use such matched data for such other uses as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(3) Replacement of certain existing data

In the case of patient assessment data being used with respect to a PAC assessment instrument that duplicates or overlaps with standardized patient assessment data within a category described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, revise or replace such existing data with the standardized data.

(4) Clarification

Standardized patient assessment data submitted pursuant to this subsection shall not be used to require individuals to be provided post-acute care by a specific type of PAC provider in order for such care to be eligible for payment under this subchapter.
