### CHAPTER 81— ENERGY CONSERVATION AND RESOURCE RENEWAL
#### § 6881. Energy resource and renewable-resource obligation guarantee program
##### (e) Information and assurances required prior to guarantees and commitments to guarantee; maintenance and availability of records; fees to borrowers; exceptions

(1) No guarantee and no commitment to guarantee may be issued under subsection (a) unless the Secretary obtains any information reasonably requested and such assurances as are in his judgment (after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) reasonable to protect the interests of the United States and to assure that such guarantee or commitment to guarantee is consistent with and will further the purpose of this subchapter. The Secretary shall require that records be kept and made available to the Secretary or the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, in such detail and form as are determined necessary to facilitate (A) an effective financial audit of the energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure investment involved, and (B) an adequate evaluation of the effectiveness of this section. The Secretary and the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of any recipient of Federal assistance under this section.

(2) The Secretary may collect a fee from any borrower with respect to whose obligation a guarantee or commitment to guarantee is issued under subsection (a); except that the Secretary may waive any such fee with respect to any such borrower or class of borrowers. Fees shall be designed to recover the estimated administrative expenses incurred under this part; except that the total of the fees charged any such borrower may not exceed (A) one percent of the amount of the guarantee, or (B) one-half percent of the amount of the commitment to guarantee, whichever is greater. Any amount collected under this paragraph shall be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.
