### CHAPTER 119— HOMELESS ASSISTANCE
#### § 11411. Use of unutilized and underutilized public buildings and real property to assist the homeless
##### (d) Holding period

(1) Properties published under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) as available for application for use to assist the homeless shall not be available for any other purpose for a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such publication.

(2) If written notice of intent to apply for such a property for use to assist the homeless is received by the Secretary of Health and Human Services within the 30-day period described under paragraph (1), such property may not be made available for any other purpose until the date the Secretary of Health and Human Services or other appropriate landholding agency has completed action on the application submitted under subsection (e) with respect to that written notice of intent.

(3) Property that is reviewed by the Secretary under subsection (a) and that is not identified by the Secretary as being suitable for use to assist the homeless may not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days after the determination of unsuitability to allow for review of the determination at the request of the representative of the homeless. The Secretary shall disseminate immediately this information to the regional offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. If no such review of the determination is requested within the 20-day period, such property will not be included in subsequent publications unless the landholding agency makes changes to the property (e.g. improvements) that may change the unsuitable determination and the Secretary subsequently determines the property is suitable.

(4)

(A) Written notice of intent to apply for a property published under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) may be filed at any time after the 30-day period described in paragraph (1) has expired. In such case, an application submitted pursuant to the notice may be approved for disposal for use to assist the homeless only if the property remains available for application for use to assist the homeless. If the property remains available, the use to assist the homeless shall be given priority of consideration over other competing disposal opportunities under sections 541–555 of title 40, except as provided in subsection (f)(3)(A).

(B) Surplus property for which an application has been approved shall be assigned promptly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for disposition in accordance with and subject to subsection (f).
