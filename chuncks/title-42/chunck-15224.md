(2) In the case of a violation of any requirement of this subchapter where such violation occurs in a State which is authorized to carry out a hazardous waste program under section 6926 of this title , the Administrator shall give notice to the State in which such violation has occurred prior to issuing an order or commencing a civil action under this section.
