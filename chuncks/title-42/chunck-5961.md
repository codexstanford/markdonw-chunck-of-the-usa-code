#### § 652. Duties of Secretary
##### (g) Performance standards for State paternity establishment programs

(1) A State’s program under this part shall be found, for purposes of section 609(a)(8) of this title , not to have complied substantially with the requirements of this part unless, for any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1994 , its paternity establishment percentage for such fiscal year is based on reliable data and (rounded to the nearest whole percentage point) equals or exceeds

(A) 90 percent;

(B) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 75 percent but less than 90 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 2 percentage points;

(C) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 50 percent but less than 75 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 3 percentage points;

(D) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 45 percent but less than 50 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 4 percentage points;

(E) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of not less than 40 percent but less than 45 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 5 percentage points; or

(F) for a State with a paternity establishment percentage of less than 40 percent for such fiscal year, the paternity establishment percentage of the State for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 6 percentage points. In determining compliance under this section, a State may use as its paternity establishment percentage either the State’s IV–D paternity establishment percentage (as defined in paragraph (2)(A)) or the State’s statewide paternity establishment percentage (as defined in paragraph (2)(B)).

(2) For purposes of this section

(A) the term “IV–D paternity establishment percentage” means, with respect to a State for a fiscal year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that the total number of children

(i) who have been born out of wedlock,

(ii)

(I) except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, with respect to whom assistance is being provided under the State program funded under part A in the fiscal year or, at the option of the State, as of the end of such year, or (II) with respect to whom services are being provided under the State’s plan approved under this part in the fiscal year or, at the option of the State, as of the end of such year pursuant to an application submitted under section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title , and

(iii) the paternity of whom has been established or acknowledged, bears to the total number of children born out of wedlock and (except as provided in such last sentence) with respect to whom assistance was being provided under the State program funded under part A as of the end of the preceding fiscal year or with respect to whom services were being provided under the State’s plan approved under this part as of the end of the preceding fiscal year pursuant to an application submitted under section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title ;

(B) the term “statewide paternity establishment percentage” means, with respect to a State for a fiscal year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that the total number of minor children

(i) who have been born out of wedlock, and

(ii) the paternity of whom has been established or acknowledged during the fiscal year, bears to the total number of children born out of wedlock during the preceding fiscal year; and

(C) the term “reliable data” means the most recent data available which are found by the Secretary to be reliable for purposes of this section. For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the total number of children shall not include any child with respect to whom assistance is being provided under the State program funded under part A by reason of the death of a parent unless paternity is established for such child or any child with respect to whom an applicant or recipient is found by the State to qualify for a good cause or other exception to cooperation pursuant to section 654(29) of this title .

(3)

(A) The Secretary may modify the requirements of this subsection to take into account such additional variables as the Secretary identifies (including the percentage of children in a State who are born out of wedlock or for whom support has not been established) that affect the ability of a State to meet the requirements of this subsection.

(B) The Secretary shall submit an annual report to the Congress that sets forth the data upon which the paternity establishment percentages for States for a fiscal year are based, lists any additional variables the Secretary has identified under subparagraph (A), and describes State performance in establishing paternity.
