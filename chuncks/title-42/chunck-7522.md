#### § 1395w–23. Payments to Medicare+Choice organizations
##### (k) Determination of applicable amount for purposes of calculating the benchmark amounts

(1) Applicable amount defined

For purposes of subsection (j), subject to paragraphs (2), (4), and (5), the term “applicable amount” means for an area

(A) for 2007

(i) if such year is not specified under subsection (c)(1)(D)(ii), an amount equal to the amount specified in subsection (c)(1)(C) for the area for 2006

(I) first adjusted by the rescaling factor for 2006 for the area (as made available by the Secretary in the announcement of the rates on April 4, 2005 , under subsection (b)(1), but excluding any national adjustment factors for coding intensity and risk adjustment budget neutrality that were included in such factor); and

(II) then increased by the national per capita MA growth percentage, described in subsection (c)(6) for 2007, but not taking into account any adjustment under subparagraph (C) of such subsection for a year before 2004;

(ii) if such year is specified under subsection (c)(1)(D)(ii), an amount equal to the greater of

(I) the amount determined under clause (i) for the area for the year; or

(II) the amount specified in subsection (c)(1)(D) for the area for the year; and

(B) for a subsequent year

(i) if such year is not specified under subsection (c)(1)(D)(ii), an amount equal to the amount determined under this paragraph for the area for the previous year (determined without regard to paragraphs (2), (4), and (5)), increased by the national per capita MA growth percentage, described in subsection (c)(6) for that succeeding year, but not taking into account any adjustment under subparagraph (C) of such subsection for a year before 2004; and

(ii) if such year is specified under subsection (c)(1)(D)(ii), an amount equal to the greater of

(I) the amount determined under clause (i) for the area for the year; or

(II) the amount specified in subsection (c)(1)(D) for the area for the year.

(2) Phase-out of budget neutrality factor

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (D), in the case of 2007 through 2010, the applicable amount determined under paragraph (1) shall be multiplied by a factor equal to 1 plus the product of

(i) the percent determined under subparagraph (B) for the year; and

(ii) the applicable phase-out factor for the year under subparagraph (C).

(B) Percent determined

(i) In general

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), subject to clause (iv), the percent determined under this subparagraph for a year is a percent equal to a fraction the numerator of which is described in clause (ii) and the denominator of which is described in clause (iii).

(ii) Numerator based on difference between demographic rate and risk rate

(I) In general

The numerator described in this clause is an amount equal to the amount by which the demographic rate described in subclause (II) exceeds the risk rate described in subclause (III).

(II) Demographic rate

The demographic rate described in this subclause is the Secretary’s estimate of the total payments that would have been made under this part in the year if all the monthly payment amounts for all MA plans were equal to 1 ⁄ 12 of the annual MA capitation rate under subsection (c)(1) for the area and year, adjusted pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(C).

(III) Risk rate

The risk rate described in this subclause is the Secretary’s estimate of the total payments that would have been made under this part in the year if all the monthly payment amounts for all MA plans were equal to the amount described in subsection (j)(1)(A) (determined as if this paragraph had not applied) under subsection (j) for the area and year, adjusted pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(C).

(iii) Denominator based on risk rate

The denominator described in this clause is equal to the total amount estimated for the year under clause (ii)(III).

(iv) Requirements

In estimating the amounts under the previous clauses, the Secretary shall

(I) use a complete set of the most recent and representative Medicare Advantage risk scores under subsection (a)(3) that are available from the risk adjustment model announced for the year;

(II) adjust the risk scores to reflect changes in treatment and coding practices in the fee-for-service sector;

(III) adjust the risk scores for differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage plans and providers under the original Medicare fee-for-service program under parts A and B to the extent that the Secretary has identified such differences, as required in subsection (a)(1)(C);

(IV) as necessary, adjust the risk scores for late data submitted by Medicare Advantage organizations;

(V) as necessary, adjust the risk scores for lagged cohorts; and

(VI) as necessary, adjust the risk scores for changes in enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans during the year.

(v) Authority

In computing such amounts the Secretary may take into account the estimated health risk of enrollees in preferred provider organization plans (including MA regional plans) for the year.

(C) Applicable phase-out factor

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the term “applicable phase-out factor” means

(i) for 2007, 0.55;

(ii) for 2008, 0.40;

(iii) for 2009, 0.25; and

(iv) for 2010, 0.05.

(D) Termination of application

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in a year if the amount estimated under subparagraph (B)(ii)(III) for the year is equal to or greater than the amount estimated under subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) for the year.

(3) No revision in percent

(A) In general

The Secretary may not make any adjustment to the percent determined under paragraph (2)(B) for any year.

(B) Rule of construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to make adjustments to the applicable amounts determined under paragraph (1) as appropriate for purposes of updating data or for purposes of adopting an improved risk adjustment methodology.

(4) Phase-out of the indirect costs of medical education from capitation rates

(A) In general

After determining the applicable amount for an area for a year under paragraph (1) (beginning with 2010), the Secretary shall adjust such applicable amount to exclude from such applicable amount the phase-in percentage (as defined in subparagraph (B)(i)) for the year of the Secretary’s estimate of the standardized costs for payments under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title in the area for the year. Any adjustment under the preceding sentence shall be made prior to the application of paragraph (2).

(B) Percentages defined

For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) Phase-in percentage

The term “phase-in percentage” means, for an area for a year, the ratio (expressed as a percentage, but in no case greater than 100 percent) of

(I) the maximum cumulative adjustment percentage for the year (as defined in clause (ii)); to

(II) the standardized IME cost percentage (as defined in clause (iii)) for the area and year.

(ii) Maximum cumulative adjustment percentage

The term “maximum cumulative adjustment percentage” means, for

(I) 2010, 0.60 percent; and

(II) a subsequent year, the maximum cumulative adjustment percentage for the previous year increased by 0.60 percentage points.

(iii) Standardized IME cost percentage

The term “standardized IME cost percentage” means, for an area for a year, the per capita costs for payments under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title (expressed as a percentage of the fee-for-service amount specified in subparagraph (C)) for the area and the year.

(C) Fee-for-service amount

The fee-for-service amount specified in this subparagraph for an area for a year is the amount specified under subsection (c)(1)(D) for the area and the year.

(5) Exclusion of costs for kidney acquisitions from capitation rates

After determining the applicable amount for an area for a year under paragraph (1) (beginning with 2021), the Secretary shall adjust such applicable amount to exclude from such applicable amount the Secretary’s estimate of the standardized costs for payments for organ acquisitions for kidney transplants covered under this subchapter (including expenses covered under section 1395rr(d) of this title ) in the area for the year.
