### CHAPTER 13A— CHILD NUTRITION
#### § 1786. Special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children
##### (h) Funds for nutrition services and administration
######## (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in any fiscal year that a State agency submits a plan to reduce average food costs per participant and to increase participation above the level estimated for the State agency, the State agency may, with the approval of the Secretary, convert amounts allocated for food benefits for such fiscal year for costs of nutrition services and administration to the extent that such conversion is necessary

(i) to cover allowable expenditures in such fiscal year; and

(ii) to ensure that the State agency maintains the level established for the per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for such fiscal year.

(B) If a State agency increases its participation level through measures that are not in the nutritional interests of participants or not otherwise allowable (such as reducing the quantities of foods provided for reasons not related to nutritional need), the Secretary may refuse to allow the State agency to convert amounts allocated for food benefits to defray costs of nutrition services and administration.

(C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “acceptable measures” includes use of cost containment measures, curtailment of vendor abuse, and breastfeeding promotion activities.
