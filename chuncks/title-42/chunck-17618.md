### CHAPTER 99— OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION
#### § 9112. Procedure
##### (i) Approval or denial of application; applications for same area; factors determinative of facility selection

(1) The Administrator shall approve or deny any timely filed application with respect to a facility for a designated application area submitted in accordance with the provision of this chapter not later than 90 days after public hearings on proposed licenses for that area are concluded pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. The Administrator shall approve or deny an application for a license for ownership, construction, and operation of an ocean thermal energy conversion plantship submitted pursuant to this chapter no later than 90 days after the public hearings on that application are concluded pursuant to subsection (g) of this section.

(2) In the event more than one application for a license for ownership, construction, and operation of an ocean thermal energy conversion facility is submitted pursuant to this chapter for the same designated application area, the Administrator, unless one or a specific combination of the proposed facilities clearly best serves the national interest, shall make decisions on license applications in the order in which they were submitted to him.

(3) In determining whether any one or a specific combination of the proposed ocean thermal energy conversion facilities clearly best serves the national interest, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall consider the following factors:

(A) the goal of making the greatest possible use of ocean thermal energy conversion by installing the largest capacity practicable in each application area;

(B) the amount of net energy impact of each of the proposed ocean thermal energy conversion facilities;

(C) the degree to which the proposed ocean thermal energy conversion facilities will affect the environment;

(D) any significant differences between anticipated dates and commencement of operation of the proposed ocean thermal energy conversion facilities; and

(E) any differences in costs of construction and operation of the proposed ocean thermal energy conversion facilities, to the extent that such differentials may significantly affect the ultimate cost of energy or products to the consumer.
