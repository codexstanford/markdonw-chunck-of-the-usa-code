##### (a) Definitions

In this section:

(1) Large-scale pilot project

The term “large-scale pilot project” means a pilot project that

(A) represents the scale of technology development beyond laboratory development and bench scale testing, but not yet advanced to the point of being tested under real operational conditions at commercial scale;

(B) represents the scale of technology necessary to gain the operational data needed to understand the technical and performance risks of the technology before the application of that technology at commercial scale or in commercial-scale demonstration; and

(C) is large enough

(i) to validate scaling factors; and

(ii) to demonstrate the interaction between major components so that control philosophies for a new process can be developed and enable the technology to advance from large-scale pilot project application to commercial-scale demonstration or application.

(2) Natural gas

The term “natural gas” means any fuel consisting in whole or in part of

(A) natural gas;

(B) liquid petroleum gas;

(C) synthetic gas derived from petroleum or natural gas liquids;

(D) any mixture of natural gas and synthetic gas; or

(E) biomethane.

(3) Natural gas electric generation facility

(A) In general

The term “natural gas electric generation facility” means a facility that generates electric energy using natural gas as the fuel.

(B) Inclusions

The term “natural gas electric generation facility” includes without limitation a new or existing

(i) simple cycle plant;

(ii) combined cycle plant;

(iii) combined heat and power plant; or

(iv) steam methane reformer that produces hydrogen from natural gas for use in the production of electric energy.

(4) Program

The term “program” means the program established under subsection (b)(1).

(5) Transformational technology

(A) In general

The term “transformational technology” means a technology that represents a significant change in the methods used to convert energy that will enable a step change in performance, efficiency, cost of electricity, and reduction of emissions as compared to the technology in existence on December 27, 2020 .

(B) Inclusions

The term “transformational technology” includes a broad range of potential technology improvements, including

(i) thermodynamic improvements in energy conversion and heat transfer, including

(I) advanced combustion systems, including oxygen combustion systems and chemical looping; and

(II) the replacement of steam cycles with supercritical carbon dioxide cycles;

(ii) improvements in steam or carbon dioxide turbine technology;

(iii) improvements in carbon capture, utilization, and storage systems technology;

(iv) improvements in small-scale and modular coal-fired technologies with reduced carbon output or carbon capture that can support incremental power generation capacity additions;

(v) fuel cell technologies for low-cost, high-efficiency modular power systems;

(vi) advanced gasification systems;

(vii) thermal cycling technologies; and

(viii) any other technology the Secretary recognizes as transformational technology.
