#### § 12771. Set-aside for community housing development organizations
##### (a) In general

For a period of 24 months after funds under part A are made available to a jurisdiction, the jurisdiction shall reserve not less than 15 percent of such funds for investment only in housing to be developed, sponsored, or owned by community housing development organizations. Each participating jurisdiction shall make reasonable efforts to identify community housing development organizations that are capable or can reasonably be expected to become capable of carrying out elements of the jurisdiction’s housing strategy and to encourage such community housing development organizations to do so. If during the first 24 months of its participation under this subchapter, a participating jurisdiction is unable to identify a sufficient number of capable community housing development organizations, then up to 20 percent of the funds allocated to that jurisdiction under this section, but not to exceed $150,000, may be made available to carry out activities that develop the capacity of community housing development organizations in that jurisdiction. A participating jurisdiction is authorized to enter into contracts with community housing development organizations to carry out this section.
