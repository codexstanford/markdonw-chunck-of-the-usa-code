(B) Determination

The determination under subparagraph (A) shall be completed not later than the completion of scoping.

(2) Range of alternatives

(A) In general

Following participation under paragraph (1) and subject to subparagraph (B), the lead agency shall determine the range of reasonable alternatives for consideration in any document that the lead agency is responsible for preparing for the covered project.

(B) Alternatives required by law

In determining the range of alternatives under subparagraph (A), the lead agency shall include all alternatives required to be considered by law.

(3) Methodologies

The lead agency shall determine, in collaboration with each cooperating agency at appropriate times during the environmental review, the methodologies to be used and the level of detail required in the analysis of each alternative for a covered project.

(B) Environmental review

A cooperating agency shall use the methodologies referred to in subparagraph (A) when conducting any required environmental review, to the extent consistent with existing law.

(4) Preferred alternative

With the concurrence of the cooperating agencies with jurisdiction under Federal law and at the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that

(A) the development of the higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative that is being considered in the environmental review; and

(B) the preferred and other alternatives are developed in sufficient detail to enable the public to comment on the alternatives.
