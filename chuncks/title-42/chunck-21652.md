### CHAPTER 149— NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY AND PROGRAMS
#### § 16161. Solar and wind technologies
##### (a) Solar energy technologies

The Secretary shall

(1) prepare a detailed roadmap for carrying out the provisions in this subchapter related to solar energy technologies and for implementing the recommendations related to solar energy technologies that are included in the report transmitted under subsection (e);

(2) provide for the establishment of 5 projects in geographic areas that are regionally and climatically diverse to demonstrate the production of hydrogen at solar energy facilities, including one demonstration project at a National Laboratory or institution of higher education;

(3) establish a program

(A) to develop optimized concentrating solar power devices that may be used for the production of both electricity and hydrogen; and

(B) to evaluate the use of thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production at the temperatures attainable with concentrating solar power devices;

(4) coordinate with activities sponsored by the Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology on high-temperature materials, thermochemical cycles, and economic issues related to solar energy;

(5) provide for the construction and operation of new concentrating solar power devices or solar power cogeneration facilities that produce hydrogen either concurrently with, or independently of, the production of electricity;

(6) support existing facilities and programs of study related to concentrating solar power devices; and

(7) establish a program

(A) to develop methods that use electricity from photovoltaic devices for the onsite production of hydrogen, such that no intermediate transmission or distribution infrastructure is required or used and future demand growth may be accommodated;

(B) to evaluate the economics of small-scale electrolysis for hydrogen production; and

(C) to study the potential of modular photovoltaic devices for the development of a hydrogen infrastructure, the security implications of a hydrogen infrastructure, and the benefits potentially derived from a hydrogen infrastructure.
