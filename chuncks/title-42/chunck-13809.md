##### (b) Rebuttal of presumption of record maintenance

(1) In general

In any dispute arising under this section after the date that is 3 years after the date of transmission of the final expenditure report for project completion as certified by the grantee, there shall be a presumption that accounting records were maintained that adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for financially assisted activities.

(2) Affirmative evidence

The presumption described in paragraph (1) may be rebutted only on production of affirmative evidence that the State or local government did not maintain documentation described in that paragraph.

(3) Inability to produce documentation

The inability of the Federal, State, or local government to produce source documentation supporting expenditure reports later than 3 years after the date of transmission of the final expenditure report for project completion as certified by the grantee shall not constitute evidence to rebut the presumption described in paragraph (1).

(4) Right of access

The period during which the Federal, State, or local government has the right to access source documentation shall not be limited to the required 3-year retention period referred to in paragraph (3), but shall last as long as the records are maintained.
