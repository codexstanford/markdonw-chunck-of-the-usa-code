(1) In general

If an individual who is an eligible insured is not lawfully present

(A) no cost-sharing reduction under this section shall apply with respect to the individual; and

(B) for purposes of applying this section, the determination as to what percentage a taxpayer’s household income bears to the poverty level for a family of the size involved shall be made under one of the following methods:

(i) A method under which

(I) the taxpayer’s family size is determined by not taking such individuals into account, and

(II) the taxpayer’s household income is equal to the product of the taxpayer’s household income (determined without regard to this subsection) and a fraction

(aa) the numerator of which is the poverty line for the taxpayer’s family size determined after application of subclause (I), and

(bb) the denominator of which is the poverty line for the taxpayer’s family size determined without regard to subclause (I).

(ii) A comparable method reaching the same result as the method under clause (i).

(2) Lawfully present

For purposes of this section, an individual shall be treated as lawfully present only if the individual is, and is reasonably expected to be for the entire period of enrollment for which the cost-sharing reduction under this section is being claimed, a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States.

(3) Secretarial authority

The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe rules setting forth the methods by which calculations of family size and household income are made for purposes of this subsection. Such rules shall be designed to ensure that the least burden is placed on individuals enrolling in qualified health plans through an Exchange and taxpayers eligible for the credit allowable under this section.
