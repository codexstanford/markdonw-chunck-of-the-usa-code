(B) one shall be appointed for a term of two years;

(B) A member may not serve after the expiration of the member’s term, unless the departure of the member would result in the loss of a quorum for the Board. If more than one member is serving after the expiration of the member’s term and a new member is appointed to the Board so that one of the members serving after the expiration of the member’s term is no longer necessary to maintain a quorum, the member whose term expired first may no longer serve on the Board.
