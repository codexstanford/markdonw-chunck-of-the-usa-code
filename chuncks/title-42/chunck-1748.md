(1) Submission of proposed pediatric study request

The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall, as appropriate, submit proposed pediatric study requests for consideration by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for pediatric studies of a specific pediatric indication identified under subsection (a). Such a proposed pediatric study request shall be made in a manner equivalent to a written request made under subsection (b) or (c) of section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 355a ], or section 262(m) of this title , including with respect to the information provided on the pediatric studies to be conducted pursuant to the request. The Director of the National Institutes of Health may submit a proposed pediatric study request for a drug for which

(A)

(i) there is an approved application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 355(j) ] or section 262(k) of this title ; or

(C) additional studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the use of the drug in the pediatric population.

(2) Written request to holders of approved applications

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in consultation with the Director of the National Institutes of Health, may issue a written request based on the proposed pediatric study request for the indication or indications submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) (which shall include a timeframe for negotiations for an agreement) for pediatric studies concerning a drug identified under subsection (a) to all holders of an approved application for the drug. Such a written request shall be made in a manner equivalent to the manner in which a written request is made under subsection (b) or (c) of section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 355a ] or section 262(m) of this title , including with respect to information provided on the pediatric studies to be conducted pursuant to the request and using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the study is requested.

(3) Requests for proposals

(4) Disqualification

A holder that receives a first right of refusal shall not be entitled to respond to a request for proposals under paragraph (3).

(6) Reporting of studies

(A) In general

On completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an award under this section, a report concerning the study shall be submitted to the Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The report shall include all data generated in connection with the study, including a written request if issued.

(B) Availability of reports

(i) In general

Each report submitted under subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be in the public domain (subject to section 505A(d)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 355a(d)(4) ]) and not later than 90 days after submission of such report, shall be

(aa) human research participants, including with respect to privacy, security, informed consent, and protected health information; and

(bb) proprietary interests, confidential commercial information, and intellectual property rights; and

(II) assigned a docket number by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and made available for the submission of public comments.

Within the 180-day period after the date on which a report is submitted under paragraph (6)(A), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall

(A) review the report and such other data as are available concerning the safe and effective use in the pediatric population of the drug studied;

(B) negotiate with the holders of approved applications for the drug studied for any labeling changes that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs determines to be appropriate and requests the holders to make; and

(ii) publish through a posting on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration a summary of the report and a copy of any requested labeling changes.

(8) Dispute resolution

(A) Referral to Pediatric Advisory Committee

If, not later than the end of the 180-day period specified in paragraph (7), the holder of an approved application for the drug involved does not agree to any labeling change requested by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs under that paragraph, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall refer the request to the Pediatric Advisory Committee.

(B) Action by the Pediatric Advisory Committee

Not later than 90 days after receiving a referral under subparagraph (A), the Pediatric Advisory Committee shall

(i) review the available information on the safe and effective use of the drug in the pediatric population, including study reports submitted under this section; and

(10) Failure to agree

If a holder of an approved application for a drug, within 30 days after receiving a request to make a labeling change under paragraph (9), does not agree to make a requested labeling change, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs may deem the drug to be misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].

(11) No effect on authority

Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the United States to bring an enforcement action under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] when a drug lacks appropriate pediatric labeling. Neither course of action (the Pediatric Advisory Committee process or an enforcement action referred to in the preceding sentence) shall preclude, delay, or serve as the basis to stay the other course of action.
