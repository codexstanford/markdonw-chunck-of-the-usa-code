### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396r. Requirements for nursing facilities
##### (h) Enforcement process

(1) In general

If a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection (g)(2) or otherwise, that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d), and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies

(A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in paragraph (2); or

(B) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may

(i) terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan,

(ii) provide for one or more of the remedies described in paragraph (2), or

(iii) do both. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a nursing facility’s deficiencies. If a State finds that a nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.

(2) Specified remedies

(A) Listing

Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedies:

(i) Denial of payment under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to the nursing facility involved after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be provided for by the State.

(ii) A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d). Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty for activities described in subsections (b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (b)(3)(B)(ii)(II), or (g)(2)(A)(i)) shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.

(iii) The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while

(I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or

(II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).  The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the State has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).

(iv) The authority, in the case of an emergency, to close the facility, to transfer residents in that facility to other facilities, or both. The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the State may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.

(B) Deadline and guidance

(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), as a condition for approval of a State plan for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1989 , each State shall establish the remedies described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) by not later than October 1, 1989 . The Secretary shall provide, through regulations by not later than October 1, 1988 , guidance to States in establishing such remedies; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedies.

(ii) A State may establish alternative remedies (other than termination of participation) other than those described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A), if the State demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as those described in subparagraph (A).

(C) Assuring prompt compliance

If a nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.

(D) Repeated noncompliance

In the case of a nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted under subsection (g)(2), has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the State shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)

(i) impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i), and

(ii) monitor the facility under subsection (g)(4)(B), until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the State, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements.

(E) Funding

The reasonable expenditures of a State to provide for temporary management and other expenses associated with implementing the remedies described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall be considered, for purposes of section 1396b(a)(7) of this title , to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan.

(F) Incentives for high quality care

In addition to the remedies specified in this paragraph, a State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities that provide the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter. For purposes of section 1396b(a)(7) of this title , proper expenses incurred by a State in carrying out such a program shall be considered to be expenses necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan under this subchapter.

(3) Secretarial authority

(A) For State nursing facilities

With respect to a State nursing facility, the Secretary shall have the authority and duties of a State under this subsection, including the authority to impose remedies described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph (2)(A).

(B) Other nursing facilities

With respect to any other nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e), and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies

(i) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subparagraph (C)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (C); or

(ii) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose any of the remedies described in subparagraph (C). Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a nursing facility’s deficiencies. If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.

(C) Specified remedies

The Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an applicable requirement:

(i) Denial of payment

The Secretary may deny any further payments to the State for medical assistance furnished by the facility to all individuals in the facility or to individuals admitted to the facility after the effective date of the finding.

(ii) Authority with respect to civil money penalties

(I) In general

Subject to subclause (II), the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .

(II) Reduction of civil money penalties in certain circumstances

Subject to subclause (III), in the case where a facility self-reports and promptly corrects a deficiency for which a penalty was imposed under this clause not later than 10 calendar days after the date of such imposition, the Secretary may reduce the amount of the penalty imposed by not more than 50 percent.

(III) Prohibitions on reduction for certain deficiencies

(aa) Repeat deficiencies

The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the Secretary had reduced a penalty imposed on the facility in the preceding year under such subclause with respect to a repeat deficiency.

(bb) Certain other deficiencies

The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the penalty is imposed on the facility for a deficiency that is found to result in a pattern of harm or widespread harm, immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of a resident or residents of the facility, or results in the death of a resident of the facility.

(IV) Collection of civil money penalties

In the case of a civil money penalty imposed under this clause, the Secretary shall issue regulations that

(aa) subject to item (cc), not later than 30 days after the imposition of the penalty, provide for the facility to have the opportunity to participate in an independent informal dispute resolution process which generates a written record prior to the collection of such penalty;

(bb) in the case where the penalty is imposed for each day of noncompliance, provide that a penalty may not be imposed for any day during the period beginning on the initial day of the imposition of the penalty and ending on the day on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed;

(cc) may provide for the collection of such civil money penalty and the placement of such amounts collected in an escrow account under the direction of the Secretary on the earlier of the date on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed or the date that is 90 days after the date of the imposition of the penalty;

(dd) may provide that such amounts collected are kept in such account pending the resolution of any subsequent appeals;

(ee) in the case where the facility successfully appeals the penalty, may provide for the return of such amounts collected (plus interest) to the facility; and

(ff) in the case where all such appeals are unsuccessful, may provide that some portion of such amounts collected may be used to support activities that benefit residents, including assistance to support and protect residents of a facility that closes (voluntarily or involuntarily) or is decertified (including offsetting costs of relocating residents to home and community-based settings or another facility), projects that support resident and family councils and other consumer involvement in assuring quality care in facilities, and facility improvement initiatives approved by the Secretary (including joint training of facility staff and surveyors, technical assistance for facilities implementing quality assurance programs, the appointment of temporary management firms, and other activities approved by the Secretary).

(iii) Appointment of temporary management

In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while

(I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or

(II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).  The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d). The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the Secretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.

(D) Continuation of payments pending remediation

The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months after the effective date of the findings, under this subchapter with respect to a nursing facility not in compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d), if

(i) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility, and

(ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action. The Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by States under this subparagraph.

(4) Effective period of denial of payment

A finding to deny payment under this subsection shall terminate when the State or Secretary (or both, as the case may be) finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).

(5) Immediate termination of participation for facility where State or Secretary finds noncompliance and immediate jeopardy

If either the State or the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d), and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the State or the Secretary, respectively  6 shall notify the other of such finding, and the State or the Secretary, respectively, shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii) or (3)(C)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan. If the facility’s participation in the State plan is terminated by either the State or the Secretary, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under the State plan consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2).

(6) Special rules where State and Secretary do not agree on finding of noncompliance

(A) State finding of noncompliance and no secretarial finding of noncompliance

If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), but a State finds that the facility has not met such requirements and the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State’s findings shall control and the remedies imposed by the State shall be applied.

(B) Secretarial finding of noncompliance and no State finding of noncompliance

If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), and that the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, but the State has not made such a finding, the Secretary

(i) may impose any remedies specified in paragraph (3)(C) with respect to the facility, and

(ii) shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D).

(7) Special rules for timing of termination of participation where remedies overlap

If both the Secretary and the State find that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), and neither finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents

(A)

(i) if both find that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State’s timing of any termination shall control so long as the termination date does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate;

(ii) if the Secretary, but not the State, finds that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the Secretary shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D); or

(iii) if the State, but not the Secretary, finds that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State’s decision to terminate, and timing of such termination, shall control; and

(B)

(i) if the Secretary or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility’s participation under the State plan, such additional or alternative remedies shall also be applied, or

(ii) if both the Secretary and the State establish one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility’s participation under the State plan, only the additional or alternative remedies of the Secretary shall apply.

(8) Construction

The remedies provided under this subsection are in addition to those otherwise available under State or Federal law and shall not be construed as limiting such other remedies, including any remedy available to an individual at common law. The remedies described in clauses (i), (ii)(IV), 7 (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(A) may be imposed during the pendency of any hearing. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to a nursing facility (or portion thereof) notwithstanding that the facility (or portion thereof) also is a skilled nursing facility for purposes of subchapter XVIII.

(9) Sharing of information

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all information concerning nursing facilities required by this section to be filed with the Secretary or a State agency shall be made available by such facilities to Federal or State employees for purposes consistent with the effective administration of programs established under this subchapter and subchapter XVIII, including investigations by State medicaid fraud control units.
