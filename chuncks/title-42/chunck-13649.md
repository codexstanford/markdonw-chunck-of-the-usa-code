For the purposes of this section, associated expenses shall include

(3) Conditions for assistance to private nonprofit facilities

(A) In general

The President may make contributions to a private nonprofit facility under paragraph (1)(B) only if

(i) the facility provides critical services (as defined by the President) in the event of a major disaster; or

(ii) the owner or operator of the facility

(I) has applied for a disaster loan under section 636(b) of title 15 ; and

(C) Religious facilities

A church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or other house of worship, educational facility, or any other private nonprofit facility, shall be eligible for contributions under paragraph (1)(B), without regard to the religious character of the facility or the primary religious use of the facility.
