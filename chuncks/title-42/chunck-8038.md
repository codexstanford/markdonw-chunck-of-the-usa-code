(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (B), to an individual who is not a part D enrollee.

(B) Continuation permitted for non-part D enrollees

Subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not apply to the renewal of a medigap Rx policy that was issued before January 1, 2006 .

(C) Construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the offering on and after January 1, 2006 , of “H”, “I”, and “J” policies described in paragraph (2)(D)(i) if the benefit packages are modified in accordance with paragraph (2)(C).

(2) Elimination of duplicative coverage upon part D enrollment

(A) In general

In the case of an individual who is covered under a medigap Rx policy and enrolls under a part D plan

(i) before the end of the initial part D enrollment period, the individual may

(I) enroll in a medicare supplemental policy without prescription drug coverage under paragraph (3); or

(II) continue the policy in effect subject to the modification described in subparagraph (C)(i); or

(ii) after the end of such period, the individual may continue the policy in effect subject to such modification.

(B) Notice required to be provided to current policyholders with medigap Rx policy

No medicare supplemental policy of an issuer shall be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) unless the issuer provides written notice (in accordance with standards of the Secretary established in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) during the 60-day period immediately preceding the initial part D enrollment period, to each individual who is a policyholder or certificate holder of a medigap Rx policy (at the most recent available address of that individual) of the following:

(i) If the individual enrolls in a plan under part D during the initial enrollment period under section 1395w–101(b)(2)(A) of this title , the individual has the option of

(I) continuing enrollment in the individual’s current plan, but the plan’s coverage of prescription drugs will be modified under subparagraph (C)(i); or

(II) enrolling in another medicare supplemental policy pursuant to paragraph (3).

(ii) If the individual does not enroll in a plan under part D during such period, the individual may continue enrollment in the individual’s current plan without change, but

(I) the individual will not be guaranteed the option of enrollment in another medicare supplemental policy pursuant to paragraph (3); and

(II) if the current plan does not provide creditable prescription drug coverage (as defined in section 1395w–113(b)(4) of this title ), notice of such fact and that there are limitations on the periods in a year in which the individual may enroll under a part D plan and any such enrollment is subject to a late enrollment penalty.

(iii) Such other information as the Secretary may specify (in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), including the potential impact of such election on premiums for medicare supplemental policies.

(C) Modification

(i) In general

The policy modification described in this subparagraph is the elimination of prescription coverage for expenses of prescription drugs incurred after the effective date of the individual’s coverage under a part D plan and the appropriate adjustment of premiums to reflect such elimination of coverage.

(ii) Continuation of renewability and application of modification

No medicare supplemental policy of an issuer shall be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) unless the issuer

(I) continues renewability of medigap Rx policies that it has issued, subject to subclause (II); and

(II) applies the policy modification described in clause (i) in the cases described in clauses (i)(II) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).

(D) References to Rx policies

(i) H, I, and J policies

Any reference to a benefit package classified as “H”, “I”, or “J” (including the benefit package classified as “J” with a high deductible feature, as described in subsection (p)(11)) under the standards established under subsection (p)(2) shall be construed as including a reference to such a package as modified under subparagraph (C) and such packages as modified shall not be counted as a separate benefit package under such subsection.

(ii) Application in waivered States

Except for the modification provided under subparagraph (C), the waivers previously in effect under subsection (p)(2) shall continue in effect.

(3) Availability of substitute policies with guaranteed issue

(A) In general

The issuer of a medicare supplemental policy

(i) may not deny or condition the issuance or effectiveness of a medicare supplemental policy that has a benefit package classified as “A”, “B”, “C”, or “F” (including the benefit package classified as “F” with a high deductible feature, as described in subsection (p)(11)), under the standards established under subsection (p)(2), or a benefit package described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (w)(2) and that is offered and is available for issuance to new enrollees by such issuer;

(ii) may not discriminate in the pricing of such policy, because of health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, or medical condition; and

(iii) may not impose an exclusion of benefits based on a pre-existing condition under such policy, in the case of an individual described in subparagraph (B) who seeks to enroll under the policy not later than 63 days after the effective date of the individual’s coverage under a part D plan.

(B) Individual covered

An individual described in this subparagraph with respect to the issuer of a medicare supplemental policy is an individual who

(i) enrolls in a part D plan during the initial part D enrollment period;

(iii) terminates enrollment in such policy and submits evidence of such termination along with the application for the policy under subparagraph (A).

(C) Special rule for waivered States

For purposes of applying this paragraph in the case of a State that provides for offering of benefit packages other than under the classification referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), the references to benefit packages in such subparagraph are deemed references to comparable benefit packages offered in such State.

The penalties described in subsection (d)(3)(A)(ii) shall apply with respect to a violation of paragraph (1)(A).

The provisions of paragraph (4) of subsection (s) shall apply with respect to the requirements of paragraph (3) in the same manner as they apply to the requirements of such subsection.

(5) Construction

Any provision in this section or in a medicare supplemental policy relating to guaranteed renewability of coverage shall be deemed to have been met with respect to a part D enrollee through the continuation of the policy subject to modification under paragraph (2)(C) or the offering of a substitute policy under paragraph (3).
