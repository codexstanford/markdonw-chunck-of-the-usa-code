##### (c) Considerations in making grants

In awarding grants under subsection (a), the Secretary shall take into consideration

(1) the ability of the entity involved to provide, either directly or through linkages, a broad range of preventive and primary health care services and related social, family support, and developmental services;

(2) different combinations of professional and lay home visitors utilized within programs that are reflective of the identified service needs and characteristics of target populations;

(3) the extent to which the population to be targeted has limited access to health care, and related social, family support, and developmental services; and

(4) whether such grants are equitably distributed among urban and rural settings and whether entities serving Native American communities are represented among the grantees.
