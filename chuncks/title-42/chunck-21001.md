### CHAPTER 143— INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTIONS
#### § 14901. Findings and purposes
##### (a) Findings

Congress recognizes

(1) the international character of the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (done at The Hague on May 29, 1993 ); and

(2) the need for uniform interpretation and implementation of the Convention in the United States and abroad, and therefore finds that enactment of a Federal law governing adoptions and prospective adoptions subject to the Convention involving United States residents is essential.
