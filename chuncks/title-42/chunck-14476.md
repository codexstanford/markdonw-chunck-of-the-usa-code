### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (o) Criteria for prescribing new or amended standards
######### (i) In determining whether a standard is economically justified, the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering

(I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;

(II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;

(III) the total projected amount of energy, or as applicable, water, savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;

(IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;

(V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;

(VI) the need for national energy and water conservation; and

(VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(V), the Attorney General shall make a determination of the impact, if any, of any lessening of competition likely to result from such standard and shall transmit such determination, not later than 60 days after the publication of a proposed rule prescribing or amending an energy conservation standard, in writing to the Secretary, together with an analysis of the nature and extent of such impact. Any such determination and analysis shall be published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.

(iii) If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy, and as applicable, water, savings during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary’s determination of whether a standard is economically justified.

(3) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section for a type (or class) of covered product if

(A) for products other than dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and kitchen ranges and ovens, a test procedure has not been prescribed pursuant to section 6293 of this title with respect to that type (or class) of product; or

(B) the Secretary determines, by rule, that the establishment of such standard will not result in significant conservation of energy or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water, or that the establishment of such standard is not technologically feasible or economically justified. For purposes of section 6297 of this title , a determination under subparagraph (B) with respect to any type (or class) of covered products shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for such type (or class).

(4) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary’s finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary’s determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types (or classes).

(5) The Secretary may set more than 1 energy conservation standard for products that serve more than 1 major function by setting 1 energy conservation standard for each major function.

(6) Regional standards for furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps.

(A) In general .

In any rulemaking to establish a new or amended standard, the Secretary may consider the establishment of separate standards by geographic region for furnaces (except boilers), central air conditioners, and heat pumps.

(B) National and regional standards.

(i) National standard .

If the Secretary establishes a regional standard for a product, the Secretary shall establish a base national standard for the product.

(ii) Regional standards .

If the Secretary establishes a regional standard for a product, the Secretary may establish more restrictive standards for the product by geographic region as follows:

(I) For furnaces, the Secretary may establish 1 additional standard that is applicable in a geographic region defined by the Secretary.

(II) For any cooling product, the Secretary may establish 1 or 2 additional standards that are applicable in 1 or 2 geographic regions as may be defined by the Secretary.

(C) Boundaries of geographic regions.

(i) In general .

Subject to clause (ii), the boundaries of additional geographic regions established by the Secretary under this paragraph shall include only contiguous States.

(ii) Alaska and hawaii .

The States of Alaska and Hawaii may be included under this paragraph in a geographic region that the States are not contiguous to.

(iii) Individual states .

Individual States shall be placed only into a single region under this paragraph.

(D) Prerequisites .

In establishing additional regional standards under this paragraph, the Secretary shall

(i) establish additional regional standards only if the Secretary determines that

(I) the establishment of additional regional standards will produce significant energy savings in comparison to establishing only a single national standard; and

(II) the additional regional standards are economically justified under this paragraph; and

(ii) consider the impact of the additional regional standards on consumers, manufacturers, and other market participants, including product distributors, dealers, contractors, and installers.

(E) Application; effective date.

(i) Base national standard .

Any base national standard established for a product under this paragraph shall

(I) be the minimum standard for the product; and

(II) apply to all products manufactured or imported into the United States on and after the effective date for the standard.

(ii) Regional standards .

Any additional and more restrictive regional standard established for a product under this paragraph shall apply to any such product installed on or after the effective date of the standard in States in which the Secretary has designated the standard to apply.

(F) Continuation of regional standards.

(i) In general .

In any subsequent rulemaking for any product for which a regional standard has been previously established, the Secretary shall determine whether to continue the establishment of separate regional standards for the product.

(ii) Regional standard no longer appropriate .

Except as provided in clause (iii), if the Secretary determines that regional standards are no longer appropriate for a product, beginning on the effective date of the amended standard for the product

(I) there shall be 1 base national standard for the product with Federal enforcement; and

(II) State authority for enforcing a regional standard for the product shall terminate.

(iii) Regional standard appropriate but standard or region changed.

(I) State no longer contained in region .

Subject to subclause (III), if a State is no longer contained in a region in which a regional standard that is more stringent than the base national standard applies, the authority of the State to enforce the regional standard shall terminate.

(II) Standard or region revised so that existing regional standard equals base national standard .

If the Secretary revises a base national standard for a product or the geographic definition of a region so that an existing regional standard for a State is equal to the revised base national standard

(aa) the authority of the State to enforce the regional standard shall terminate on the effective date of the revised base national standard; and

(bb) the State shall be subject to the revised base national standard.

(III) Standard or region revised so that existing regional standard equals base national standard .

If the Secretary revises a base national standard for a product or the geographic definition of a region so that the standard for a State is lower than the previously approved regional standard, the State may continue to enforce the previously approved standard level.

(iv) Waiver of federal preemption .

Nothing in this paragraph diminishes the authority of a State to enforce a State regulation for which a waiver of Federal preemption has been granted under section 6297(d) of this title .

(G) Enforcement.

(i) Base national standard.

(I) In general .

The Secretary shall enforce any base national standard.

(II) Trade association certification programs .

In enforcing the base national standard, the Secretary shall use, to the maximum extent practicable, national standard nationally recognized certification programs of trade associations.

(ii) Regional standards.

(I) Enforcement plan .

Not later than 90 days after the date of the issuance of a final rule that establishes a regional standard, the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to develop and implement an effective enforcement plan for regional standards for the products that are covered by the final rule.

(II) Responsible entities .

Any rules regarding enforcement of a regional standard shall clearly specify which entities are legally responsible for compliance with the standards and for making any required information or labeling disclosures.

(III) Final rule .

Not later than 15 months after the date of the issuance of a final rule that establishes a regional standard for a product, the Secretary shall promulgate a final rule covering enforcement of regional standards for the product.

(IV) Incorporation by states and localities .

A State or locality may incorporate any Federal regional standard into State or local building codes or State appliance standards.

(V) State enforcement .

A State agency may seek enforcement of a Federal regional standard in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction.

(H) Information disclosure.

(i) In general .

Not later than 90 days after the date of the publication of a final rule that establishes a regional standard for a product, the Federal Trade Commission shall undertake a rulemaking to determine the appropriate 1 or more methods for disclosing information so that consumers, distributors, contractors, and installers can easily determine whether a specific piece of equipment that is installed in a specific building is in conformance with the regional standard that applies to the building.

(ii) Methods .

A method of disclosing information under clause (i) may include

(I) modifications to the Energy Guide label; or

(II) other methods that make it easy for consumers and installers to use and understand at the point of installation.

(iii) Completion of rulemaking .

The rulemaking shall be completed not later 15 months after the date of the publication of a final rule that establishes a regional standard for a product.
