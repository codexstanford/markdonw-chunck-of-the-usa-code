### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395i–6. Hospice program survey and enforcement procedures
##### (c) Enforcement

(1) Situations involving immediate jeopardy

If the Secretary determines on the basis of a standard survey or otherwise that a hospice program that is certified for participation under this subchapter is no longer in compliance with the requirements specified in section 1395x(dd) of this title and determines that the deficiencies involved immediately jeopardize the health and safety of the individuals to whom the program furnishes items and services, the Secretary shall take immediate action to ensure the removal of the jeopardy and correction of the deficiencies or terminate the certification of the program, and may provide, in addition, for 1 or more of the other remedies described in paragraph (5)(B).

(2) Situations not involving immediate jeopardy

If the Secretary determines on the basis of a standard survey or otherwise that a hospice program that is certified for participation under this subchapter is no longer in compliance with the requirements specified in section 1395x(dd) of this title and determines that the deficiencies involved do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of the individuals to whom the program furnishes items and services, the Secretary may (for a period not to exceed 6 months) impose remedies developed pursuant to paragraph (5)(A), in lieu of terminating the certification of the program. If, after such a period of remedies, the program is still no longer in compliance with such requirements, the Secretary shall terminate the certification of the program.

(3) Penalty for previous noncompliance

If the Secretary determines that a hospice program that is certified for participation under this subchapter is in compliance with the requirements specified in section 1395x(dd) of this title but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (5)(B)(i) for the days in which the Secretary finds that the program was not in compliance with such requirements.

(4) Option to continue payments for noncompliant hospice programs

The Secretary may continue payments under this subchapter with respect to a hospice program not in compliance with the requirements specified in section 1395x(dd) of this title over a period of not longer than 6 months, if

(A) the State or local survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the program with such requirements than to terminate the certification of the program;

(B) the program has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action; and

(C) the program agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this subchapter during such period if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable. The Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by hospice programs under this paragraph.

(i) Civil money penalties

(I) In general

Subject to subclause (II), the provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this subsection in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .

(II) Retention of amounts for hospice program improvements

The Secretary may provide that any portion of civil money penalties collected under this subsection may be used to support activities that benefit individuals receiving hospice care, including education and training programs to ensure hospice program compliance with the requirements of section 1395x(dd) of this title .

(ii) Suspension of payment

A finding to suspend payment under subparagraph (B)(ii) shall terminate when the Secretary finds that the program is in substantial compliance with all requirements of section 1395x(dd) of this title .
