#### § 4370m–4. Coordination of required reviews
##### (a) Concurrent reviews

To integrate environmental reviews and authorizations, each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable

(1) carry out the obligations of the agency with respect to a covered project under any other applicable law concurrently, and in conjunction with, other environmental reviews and authorizations being conducted by other cooperating or participating agencies, including environmental reviews and authorizations required under NEPA, unless the agency determines that doing so would impair the ability of the agency to carry out the statutory obligations of the agency;

(2) formulate and implement administrative, policy, and procedural mechanisms to enable the agency to ensure completion of the environmental review process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner; and

(3) where an environmental impact statement is required for a project, prepare a single, joint interagency environmental impact statement for the project unless the lead agency provides justification in the coordinated project plan that multiple environmental documents are more efficient for project review and authorization.
