### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–4. Payment for physicians’ services
##### (g) Limitation on beneficiary liability

(1) Limitation on actual charges

(A) In general

In the case of a nonparticipating physician or nonparticipating supplier or other person (as defined in section 1395u(i)(2) of this title ) who does not accept payment on an assignment-related basis for a physician’s service furnished with respect to an individual enrolled under this part, the following rules apply:

(i) Application of limiting charge

No person may bill or collect an actual charge for the service in excess of the limiting charge described in paragraph (2) for such service.

(ii) No liability for excess charges

No person is liable for payment of any amounts billed for the service in excess of such limiting charge.

(iii) Correction of excess charges

If such a physician, supplier, or other person bills, but does not collect, an actual charge for a service in violation of clause (i), the physician, supplier, or other person shall reduce on a timely basis the actual charge billed for the service to an amount not to exceed the limiting charge for the service.

(iv) Refund of excess collections

If such a physician, supplier, or other person collects an actual charge for a service in violation of clause (i), the physician, supplier, or other person shall provide on a timely basis a refund to the individual charged in the amount by which the amount collected exceeded the limiting charge for the service. The amount of such a refund shall be reduced to the extent the individual has an outstanding balance owed by the individual to the physician.

(B) Sanctions

If a physician, supplier, or other person

(i) knowingly and willfully bills or collects for services in violation of subparagraph (A)(i) on a repeated basis, or

(ii) fails to comply with clause (iii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A) on a timely basis, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the physician, supplier, or other person in accordance with paragraph (2) of section 1395u(j) of this title . In applying this subparagraph, paragraph (4) of such section applies in the same manner as such paragraph applies to such section and any reference in such section to a physician is deemed also to include a reference to a supplier or other person under this subparagraph.

(C) Timely basis

For purposes of this paragraph, a correction of a bill for an excess charge or refund of an amount with respect to a violation of subparagraph (A)(i) in the case of a service is considered to be provided “on a timely basis”, if the reduction or refund is made not later than 30 days after the date the physician, supplier, or other person is notified by the carrier under this part of such violation and of the requirements of subparagraph (A).

(2) “Limiting charge” defined

(A) For 1991

For physicians’ services of a physician furnished during 1991, other than radiologist services subject to section 1395m(b) of this title , the “limiting charge” shall be the same percentage (or, if less, 25 percent) above the recognized payment amount under this part with respect to the physician (as a nonparticipating physician) as the percentage by which

(i) the maximum allowable actual charge (as determined under section 1395u(j)(1)(C) of this title as of December 31, 1990 , or, if less, the maximum actual charge otherwise permitted for the service under this part as of such date) for the service of the physician, exceeds

(ii) the recognized payment amount for the service of the physician (as a nonparticipating physician) as of such date. In the case of evaluation and management services (as specified in section 1395u(b)(16)(B)(ii) of this title ), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting “40 percent” for “25 percent”.

(B) For 1992

For physicians’ services furnished during 1992, other than radiologist services subject to section 1395m(b) of this title , the “limiting charge” shall be the same percentage (or, if less, 20 percent) above the recognized payment amount under this part for nonparticipating physicians as the percentage by which

(i) the limiting charge (as determined under subparagraph (A) as of December 31, 1991 ) for the service, exceeds

(ii) the recognized payment amount for the service for nonparticipating physicians as of such date.

(C) After 1992

For physicians’ services furnished in a year after 1992, the “limiting charge” shall be 115 percent of the recognized payment amount under this part for nonparticipating physicians or for nonparticipating suppliers or other persons.

(D) Recognized payment amount

In this section, the term “recognized payment amount” means, for services furnished on or after January 1, 1992 , the fee schedule amount determined under subsection (a) (or, if payment under this part is made on a basis other than the fee schedule under this section, 95 percent of the other payment basis), and, for services furnished during 1991, the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1395u(b)(4)(A)(iv) of this title ) of the prevailing charge (or fee schedule amount) for nonparticipating physicians for that year.

(3) Limitation on charges for medicare beneficiaries eligible for medicaid benefits

(A) In general

Payment for physicians’ services furnished on or after April 1, 1990 , to an individual who is enrolled under this part and eligible for any medical assistance (including as a qualified medicare beneficiary, as defined in section 1396d(p)(1) of this title ) with respect to such services under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX may only be made on an assignment-related basis and the provisions of section 1396a(n)(3)(A) of this title apply to further limit permissible charges under this section.

(B) Penalty

A person may not bill for physicians’ services subject to subparagraph (A) other than on an assignment-related basis. No person is liable for payment of any amounts billed for such a service in violation of the previous sentence. If a person knowingly and willfully bills for physicians’ services in violation of the first sentence, the Secretary may apply sanctions against the person in accordance with section 1395u(j)(2) of this title .

(4) Physician submission of claims

(A) In general

For services furnished on or after September 1, 1990 , within 1 year after the date of providing a service for which payment is made under this part on a reasonable charge or fee schedule basis, a physician, supplier, or other person (or an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1395u(b)(6)(A) of this title )

(i) shall complete and submit a claim for such service on a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to the carrier on behalf of a beneficiary, and

(ii) may not impose any charge relating to completing and submitting such a form.

(B) Penalty

(i) With respect to an assigned claim wherever a physician, provider, supplier or other person (or an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1395u(b)(6)(A) of this title ) fails to submit such a claim as required in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce by 10 percent the amount that would otherwise be paid for such claim under this part.

(ii) If a physician, supplier, or other person (or an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1395u(b)(6)(A) of this title ) fails to submit a claim required to be submitted under subparagraph (A) or imposes a charge in violation of such subparagraph, the Secretary shall apply the sanction with respect to such a violation in the same manner as a sanction may be imposed under section 1395u(p)(3) of this title for a violation of section 1395u(p)(1) of this title .

(5) Electronic billing; direct deposit

The Secretary shall encourage and develop a system providing for expedited payment for claims submitted electronically. The Secretary shall also encourage and provide incentives allowing for direct deposit as payments for services furnished by participating physicians. The Secretary shall provide physicians with such technical information as necessary to enable such physicians to submit claims electronically. The Secretary shall submit a plan to Congress on this paragraph by May 1, 1990 .

(6) Monitoring of charges

(A) In general

The Secretary shall monitor

(i) the actual charges of nonparticipating physicians for physicians’ services furnished on or after January 1, 1991 , to individuals enrolled under this part, and

(ii) changes (by specialty, type of service, and geographic area) in (I) the proportion of expenditures for physicians’ services provided under this part by participating physicians, (II) the proportion of expenditures for such services for which payment is made under this part on an assignment-related basis, and (III) the amounts charged above the recognized payment amounts under this part.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission shall review the Secretary’s plan and recommendations and transmit to Congress its comments regarding such plan and recommendations.

(7) Monitoring of utilization and access

(A) In general

The Secretary shall monitor

(i) changes in the utilization of and access to services furnished under this part within geographic, population, and service related categories,

(ii) possible sources of inappropriate utilization of services furnished under this part which contribute to the overall level of expenditures under this part, and

(iii) factors underlying these changes and their interrelationships.
