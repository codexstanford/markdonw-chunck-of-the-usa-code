#### § 285a–11. Pediatric cancer research, awareness, and survivorship
##### (b) Improving care for pediatric cancer survivors

(1) Research on pediatric cancer survivorship

The Director of NIH, in coordination with ongoing research activities, may continue to conduct or support pediatric cancer survivorship research including in any of the following areas:

(A) Outcomes of pediatric cancer survivors, including within minority or other medically underserved populations and with respect to health disparities of such outcomes.

(B) Barriers to follow-up care for pediatric cancer survivors, including within minority or other medically underserved populations.

(C) The impact of relevant factors, which may include familial, socioeconomic, and other environmental factors, on treatment outcomes and survivorship.

(D) The development of indicators used for long-term follow-up and analysis of the late effects of cancer treatment for pediatric cancer survivors.

(E) The identification of, as applicable

(i) risk factors associated with the late effects of cancer treatment;

(ii) predictors of adverse neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes; and

(iii) the molecular basis of long-term complications.

(F) The development of targeted interventions to reduce the burden of morbidity borne by cancer survivors in order to protect such cancer survivors from the late effects of cancer.

(2) Balanced approach

In conducting or supporting research under paragraph (1)(A)(i) on pediatric cancer survivors within minority or other medically underserved populations, the Director of NIH shall ensure that such research addresses both the physical and the psychological needs of such survivors, as appropriate.
