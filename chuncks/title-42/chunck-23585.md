#### § 18932. Greenhouse gas measurement research
##### (d) Center for Greenhouse Gas Measurements, Standards, and Information

(1) In general

The Director, in collaboration with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall establish a Center for Greenhouse Gas Measurements, Standards, and Information (in this subsection referred to as the “Center”).

(2) Collaborations

The Director shall require that the activities of the Center include collaboration among public and private organizations, including institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, private sector entities, and State, Tribal, territorial, and local officials.

(3) Purpose

The purpose of the Center shall be to

(A) advance measurement science, data analytics, and modeling at a range of scales that covers direct measurement and estimation at the component or process level through atmospheric observations and at the analysis level to improve the accuracy of spatially and temporally resolved greenhouse gas emissions measurement, validation, and attribution to specific underlying activities and processes;

(B) test and evaluate the performance of existing capabilities, and inform and improve best practices, benchmarks, methodologies, procedures, and technical standards, for the measurement and validation of greenhouse gas emissions at scales noted in subparagraph (A);

(C) educate and train students in measurement science, computational science, and systems engineering research relevant to greenhouse gas emissions measurements;

(D) foster collaboration among academic researchers, private sector stakeholders, and State, Tribal, territorial, and local officials in the use of Institute testbeds as described in subsection (c);

(E) conduct activities with research institutions, industry partners, and State and local officials to identify research, testing, and technical standards needs relevant to greenhouse gas emissions; and

(F) collaborate with other Federal agencies to conduct outreach and coordination to share and promote technical data, tools, and expertise with relevant public and private sector stakeholders, including State, Tribal, territorial, and local officials, to assist such in the accurate measurement of greenhouse gas emissions.
