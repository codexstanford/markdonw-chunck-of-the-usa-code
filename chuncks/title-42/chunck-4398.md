(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any person who has sustained a vaccine-related injury, the legal representative of such person if such person is a minor or is disabled, or the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table may, if the person meets the requirements of subsection (c)(1), file a petition for compensation under the Program.

(B) No person may file a petition for a vaccine-related injury or death associated with a vaccine administered before October 1, 1988 , if compensation has been paid under this part for 3500 petitions for such injuries or deaths.

(2) Only one petition may be filed with respect to each administration of a vaccine.
