### CHAPTER 20A— CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION
#### § 1975a. Duties of Commission
##### (e) Hearings and ancillary matters

(1) Power to hold hearings

The Commission, or on the authorization of the Commission, any subcommittee of two or more members of the Commission, at least one of whom shall be of each major political party, may, for the purpose of carrying out this chapter, hold such hearings and act at such times and places as the Commission or such authorized subcommittee deems advisable. Each member of the Commission shall have the power to administer oaths and affirmations in connection with the proceedings of the Commission. The holding of a hearing by the Commission or the appointment of a subcommittee to hold a hearing pursuant to this paragraph must be approved by a majority of the Commission, or by a majority of the members present at a meeting when a quorum is present.

(2) Power to issue subpoenas

The Commission may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of written or other matter. Such a subpoena may not require the presence of a witness more than 100 miles outside the place wherein the witness is found or resides or is domiciled or transacts business, or has appointed an agent for receipt of service of process. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Attorney General may in a Federal court of appropriate jurisdiction obtain an appropriate order to enforce the subpoena.

(3) Witness fees

A witness attending any proceeding of the Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.

(4) Depositions and interrogatories

The Commission may use depositions and written interrogatories to obtain information and testimony about matters that are the subject of a Commission hearing or report.
