#### § 17113. Industrial emissions reduction technology development program
##### (c) Focus areas

The program shall focus on

(1) industrial production processes, including technologies and processes that

(A) achieve emissions reduction in high emissions industrial materials production processes, including production processes for iron, steel, steel mill products, aluminum, cement, concrete, glass, pulp, paper, and industrial ceramics;

(B) achieve emissions reduction in medium- and high-temperature heat generation, including

(i) through electrification of heating processes;

(ii) through renewable heat generation technology;

(iii) through combined heat and power; and

(iv) by switching to alternative fuels, including hydrogen and nuclear energy;

(C) achieve emissions reduction in chemical production processes, including by incorporating, if appropriate and practicable, principles, practices, and methodologies of sustainable chemistry and engineering;

(D) leverage smart manufacturing technologies and principles, digital manufacturing technologies, and advanced data analytics to develop advanced technologies and practices in information, automation, monitoring, computation, sensing, modeling, and networking to

(i) model and simulate manufacturing production lines;

(ii) monitor and communicate production line status;

(iii) manage and optimize energy productivity and cost throughout production; and

(iv) model, simulate, and optimize the energy efficiency of manufacturing processes;

(E) leverage the principles of sustainable manufacturing to minimize the potential negative environmental impacts of manufacturing while conserving energy and resources, including

(i) by designing products that enable reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling;

(ii) by minimizing waste from industrial processes, including through the reuse of waste as other resources in other industrial processes for mutual benefit; and

(iii) by increasing resource efficiency; and

(F) increase the energy efficiency of industrial processes;

(2) alternative materials that produce fewer emissions during production and result in fewer emissions during use, including

(A) high-performance lightweight materials; and

(B) substitutions for critical materials and minerals;

(3) development of net-zero emissions liquid and gaseous fuels;

(4) emissions reduction in shipping, aviation, and long distance transportation;

(5) carbon capture technologies for industrial processes;

(6) other technologies that achieve net-zero emissions in nonpower industrial sectors, as determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Director; and

(7) high-performance computing to develop advanced materials and manufacturing processes contributing to the focus areas described in paragraphs (1) through (6), including

(A) modeling, simulation, and optimization of the design of energy efficient and sustainable products; and

(B) the use of digital prototyping and additive manufacturing to enhance product design.

(8) incorporation of sustainable chemistry and engineering principles, practices, and methodologies, as the Secretary determines appropriate; and

(9) other research or technology areas identified in the Strategic Plan authorized in section 17114 of this title .
