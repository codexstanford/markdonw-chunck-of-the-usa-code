### CHAPTER 50— NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE
#### § 4022. State and local land use controls
##### (a) Requirement for participation in flood insurance program

(1) In general

After December 31, 1971 , no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided under this chapter in any area (or subdivision thereof) unless an appropriate public body shall have adopted adequate land use and control measures (with effective enforcement provisions) which the Administrator finds are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use under section 4102 of this title .

(2) Agricultural structures

(A) Activity restrictions

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the adequate land use and control measures required to be adopted in an area (or subdivision thereof) pursuant to paragraph (1) may provide, at the discretion of the appropriate State or local authority, for the repair and restoration to predamaged conditions of an agricultural structure that

(i) is a repetitive loss structure; or

(ii) has incurred flood-related damage to the extent that the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

(B) Premium rates and coverage

To the extent applicable, an agricultural structure repaired or restored pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall pay chargeable premium rates established under section 4015 of this title at the estimated risk premium rates under section 4014(a)(1) of this title . If resources are available, the Administrator shall provide technical assistance and counseling, upon request of the owner of the structure, regarding wet flood-proofing and other flood damage reduction measures for agricultural structures. The Administrator shall not be required to make flood insurance coverage available for such an agricultural structure unless the structure is wet flood-proofed through permanent or contingent measures applied to the structure or its contents that prevent or provide resistance to damage from flooding by allowing flood waters to pass through the structure, as determined by the Administrator.

(C) Prohibition on disaster relief

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any agricultural structure repaired or restored pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be eligible for disaster relief assistance under any program administered by the Administrator or any other Federal agency.

(D) Definitions
