### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396o–1. State option for alternative premiums and cost sharing
##### (e) State option for permitting hospitals to impose cost sharing for non-emergency care furnished in an emergency department

(1) In general

Notwithstanding section 1396 o of this title and section 1396a(a)(1) of this title or the previous provisions of this section, but subject to the limitations of paragraph (2), a State may, by amendment to its State plan under this subchapter, permit a hospital to impose cost sharing for non-emergency services furnished to an individual (within one or more groups of individuals specified by the State) in the hospital emergency department under this subsection if the following conditions are met:

(A) Access to non-emergency room provider

The individual has actually available and accessible (as such terms are applied by the Secretary under section 1396 o (b)(3) of this title) an alternate non-emergency services provider with respect to such services.

(B) Notice

The hospital must inform the beneficiary after receiving an appropriate medical screening examination under section 1395dd of this title and after a determination has been made that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition, but before providing the non-emergency services, of the following:

(i) The hospital may require the payment of the State specified cost sharing before the service can be provided.

(ii) The name and location of an alternate non-emergency services provider (described in subparagraph (A)) that is actually available and accessible (as described in such subparagraph).

(iii) The fact that such alternate provider can provide the services without the imposition of cost sharing described in clause (i).

(iv) The hospital provides a referral to coordinate scheduling of this treatment. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a State from applying (or waiving) cost sharing otherwise permissible under this section to services described in clause (iii).

(2) Limitations

(A) Individuals with family income between 100 and 150 percent of the poverty line

In the case of an individual described in subsection (b)(1) who is not described in subparagraph (B), the cost sharing imposed under this subsection may not exceed twice the amount determined to be nominal under section 1396 o of this title, subject to the percent of income limitation otherwise applicable under subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii).

(B) Application to exempt populations

In the case of an individual described in subsection (a)(2)(A) or who is not subject to cost sharing under subsection (b)(3)(B) with respect to non-emergency services described in paragraph (1), a State may impose cost sharing under paragraph (1) for care in an amount that does not exceed a nominal amount (as otherwise determined under section 1396 o of this title) so long as no cost sharing is imposed to receive such care through an outpatient department or other alternative health care provider in the geographic area of the hospital emergency department involved.

(C) Continued application of aggregate cap; relation to other cost sharing

In addition to the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B), any cost sharing under paragraph (1) is subject to the aggregate cap on cost sharing applied under subsection (a)(2)(B) or under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b), as the case may be. Cost sharing imposed for services under this subsection shall be instead of any cost sharing that may be imposed for such services under subsection (a) or section 1396 o of this title.

(3) Construction

Nothing in this section shall be construed

(A) to limit a hospital’s obligations with respect to screening and stabilizing treatment of an emergency medical condition under section 1395dd of this title ; or

(B) to modify any obligations under either State or Federal standards relating to the application of a prudent-layperson standard with respect to payment or coverage of emergency services by any managed care organization.

(4) Definitions

For purposes of this subsection:

(A) Non-emergency services

The term “non-emergency services” means any care or services furnished in an emergency department of a hospital that do not constitute an appropriate medical screening examination or stabilizing examination and treatment required to be provided by the hospital under section 1395dd of this title .

(B) Alternate non-emergency services provider

The term “alternative non-emergency services provider” means, with respect to non-emergency services for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition, a health care provider, such as a physician’s office, health care clinic, community health center, hospital outpatient department, or similar health care provider, that can provide clinically appropriate services for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition contemporaneously with the provision of the non-emergency services that would be provided in an emergency department of a hospital for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition, and that is participating in the program under this subchapter.
