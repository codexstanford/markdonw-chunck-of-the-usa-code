#### § 5871. Transitional provisions
##### (c) Effect of chapter on proceedings pending before Atomic Energy Commission or other department or agency

The provisions of this chapter shall not affect any proceeding pending, at the time this section takes effect, before the Atomic Energy Commission or any department or agency (or component thereof) functions of which are transferred by this chapter; but such proceedings, to the extent that they relate to functions so transferred, shall be continued. Orders shall be issued in such proceedings, appeals shall be taken therefrom, and payments shall be made pursuant to such orders, as if this chapter had not been enacted; and orders issued in any such proceedings shall continue in effect until modified, terminated, superseded, or revoked by a duly authorized official, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or by operation of law. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit the discontinuance or modification of any such proceeding under the same terms and conditions and to the same extent that such proceeding could have been discontinued if this chapter had not been enacted.
