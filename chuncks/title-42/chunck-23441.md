#### § 18743. Critical minerals mining and recycling research
##### (b) Critical minerals mining and recycling research and development

(1) In general

In order to support supply chain resiliency, the Secretary, in coordination with the Director, shall issue awards, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities described in paragraph (2) to support basic research that will accelerate innovation to advance critical minerals mining, recycling, and reclamation strategies and technologies for the purposes of

(A) making better use of domestic resources; and

(B) eliminating national reliance on minerals and mineral materials that are subject to supply disruptions.

(2) Eligible entities

Entities eligible to receive an award under paragraph (1) are the following:

(A) Institutions of higher education.

(B) National Laboratories.

(C) Nonprofit organizations.

(D) Consortia of entities described in subparagraphs (A) through (C), including consortia that collaborate with private industry.

(3) Use of funds

Activities funded by an award under this section may include

(A) advancing mining research and development activities to develop new mapping and mining technologies and techniques, including advanced critical mineral extraction and production

(i) to improve existing, or to develop new, supply chains of critical minerals; and

(ii) to yield more efficient, economical, and environmentally benign mining practices;

(B) advancing critical mineral processing research activities to improve separation, alloying, manufacturing, or recycling techniques and technologies that can decrease the energy intensity, waste, potential environmental impact, and costs of those activities;

(C) advancing research and development of critical minerals mining and recycling technologies that take into account the potential end-uses and disposal of critical minerals, in order to improve end-to-end integration of mining and technological applications;

(D) conducting long-term earth observation of reclaimed mine sites, including the study of the evolution of microbial diversity at those sites;

(E) examining the application of artificial intelligence for geological exploration of critical minerals, including what size and diversity of data sets would be required;

(F) examining the application of machine learning for detection and sorting of critical minerals, including what size and diversity of data sets would be required;

(G) conducting detailed isotope studies of critical minerals and the development of more refined geologic models; or

(H) providing training and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students to prepare the next generation of mining engineers and researchers.
