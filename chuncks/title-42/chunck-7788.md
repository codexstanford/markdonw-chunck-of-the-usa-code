#### § 1395y. Exclusions from coverage and medicare as secondary payer
##### (i) Awards and contracts for original research and experimentation of new and existing medical procedures; conditions

In order to supplement the activities of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission under section 1395ww(e) of this title in assessing the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of new and existing medical procedures, the Secretary may carry out, or award grants or contracts for, original research and experimentation of the type described in clause (ii) of section 1395ww(e)(6)(E) of this title with respect to such a procedure if the Secretary finds that

(1) such procedure is not of sufficient commercial value to justify research and experimentation by a commercial organization;

(2) research and experimentation with respect to such procedure is not of a type that may appropriately be carried out by an institute, division, or bureau of the National Institutes of Health; and

(3) such procedure has the potential to be more cost-effective in the treatment of a condition than procedures currently in use with respect to such condition.
