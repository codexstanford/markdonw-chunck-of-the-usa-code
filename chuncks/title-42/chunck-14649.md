#### § 6345. CHP Technical Assistance Partnership Program
##### (b) CHP Technical Assistance Partnership Program

(1) In general

The Program shall

(A) operate programs to encourage deployment of combined heat and power, waste heat to power, and efficient district energy (collectively referred to in this subsection as “CHP”) technologies by providing education and outreach to

(i) building, industrial, and electric and natural gas utility professionals;

(ii) State and local policymakers; and

(iii) other individuals and organizations with an interest in efficient energy use, local or opportunity fuel use, resiliency, or energy security, microgrids, and district energy; and

(B) provide project specific support to building and industrial professionals through economic and engineering assessments and advisory activities.

(2) Funding for certain activities

(A) In general

The Program shall make funds available to institutions of higher education, research centers, and other appropriate institutions to ensure the continued operations and effectiveness of the regional CHP Technical Assistance Partnerships.

(B) Use of funds

Funds made available under subparagraph (A) may be used

(i) to collect and distribute informational materials relevant to manufacturers, commercial buildings, institutional facilities, and Federal sites, including continued support of the mission goals of the Department of Defense, on CHP and microgrid technologies, including continuation and updating of

(I) the CHP installation database;

(II) CHP technology potential analyses;

(III) State CHP resource pages; and

(IV) CHP Technical Assistance Partnerships websites;

(ii) to produce and conduct workshops, reports, seminars, internet programs, CHP resiliency resources, and other activities to provide education to end users, regulators, and stakeholders in a manner that leads to the deployment of CHP technologies;

(iii) to provide or coordinate onsite assessments for sites and enterprises that may consider deployment of CHP technology, including the potential use of biomass CHP systems;

(iv) to identify candidates for deployment of CHP technologies, hybrid renewable-CHP technologies, biomass CHP, microgrids, and clean energy;

(v) to provide nonbiased engineering support to sites considering deployment of CHP technologies;

(vi) to assist organizations and communities, including rural communities, developing clean energy technologies and policies in overcoming barriers to deployment; and

(vii) to assist companies, communities (including rural communities), and organizations with field validation and performance evaluations of CHP and other clean energy technologies implemented.

(C) Duration

The Program shall make funds available under subparagraph (A) for a period of 5 years.
