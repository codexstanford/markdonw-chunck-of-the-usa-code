#### § 4822. Requirements for housing receiving Federal assistance
##### (a) General requirements

(1) Elimination of hazards

The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) shall establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable the hazards of lead based paint poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary or otherwise receives more than $5,000 in project-based assistance under a Federal housing program. Beginning on January 1, 1995 , such procedures shall apply to all such housing that constitutes target housing, as defined in section 4851b of this title , and shall provide for appropriate measures to conduct risk assessments, inspections, interim controls, and abatement of lead-based paint hazards. At a minimum, such procedures shall require

(A) the provision of lead hazard information pamphlets, developed pursuant to section 2686 of title 15 , to purchasers and tenants;

(B) periodic risk assessments and interim controls in accordance with a schedule determined by the Secretary, the initial risk assessment of each unit constructed prior to 1960 to be conducted not later than January 1, 1996 , and, for units constructed between 1960 and 1978

(i) not less than 25 percent shall be performed by January 1, 1998 ;

(ii) not less than 50 percent shall be performed by January 1, 2000 ; and

(iii) the remainder shall be performed by January 1, 2002 ;

(C) inspection for the presence of lead-based paint prior to federally-funded renovation or rehabilitation that is likely to disturb painted surfaces;

(D) reduction of lead-based paint hazards in the course of rehabilitation projects receiving less than $25,000 per unit in Federal funds;

(E) abatement of lead-based paint hazards in the course of substantial rehabilitation projects receiving more than $25,000 per unit in Federal funds;

(F) where risk assessment, inspection, or reduction activities have been undertaken, the provision of notice to occupants describing the nature and scope of such activities and the actual risk assessment or inspection reports (including available information on the location of any remaining lead-based paint on a surface-by-surface basis); and

(G) such other measures as the Secretary deems appropriate.

(2) Additional measures

The Secretary may establish such other procedures as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.

(3) Disposition of federally owned housing

(A) Pre-1960 target housing

Beginning on January 1, 1995 , procedures established under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall require the inspection and abatement of lead-based paint hazards in all federally owned target housing constructed prior to 1960.

(B) Target housing constructed between 1960 and 1978

Beginning on January 1, 1995 , procedures established under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall require an inspection for lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in all federally owned target housing constructed between 1960 and 1978. The results of such inspections shall be made available to prospective purchasers, identifying the presence of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards on a surface-by-surface basis. The Secretary shall have the discretion to waive the requirement of this subparagraph for housing in which a federally funded risk assessment, performed by a certified contractor, has determined no lead-based paint hazards are present.

(C) Budget authority

To the extent that subparagraphs (A) and (B) increase the cost to the Government of outstanding direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments, such activities shall be treated as modifications under section 661c(e) of title 2 and shall be subject to the availability of appropriations. To the extent that paragraphs (A) and (B) impose additional costs to the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its requirements shall be carried out only if appropriations are provided in advance in an appropriations Act. In the absence of appropriations sufficient to cover the costs of subparagraphs (A) and (B), these requirements shall not apply to the affected agency or agencies.
