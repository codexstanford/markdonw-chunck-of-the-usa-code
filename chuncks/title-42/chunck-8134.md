#### § 1395ww. Payments to hospitals for inpatient hospital services
##### (j) Prospective payment for inpatient rehabilitation services

(1) Payment during transition period

(A) In general

Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title , but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title , the amount of the payment with respect to the operating and capital costs of inpatient hospital services of a rehabilitation hospital or a rehabilitation unit (in this subsection referred to as a “rehabilitation facility”), other than a facility making an election under subparagraph (F) in a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2000 , and before October 1, 2002 , is equal to the sum of

(i) the TEFRA percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the amount that would have been paid under part A with respect to such costs if this subsection did not apply, and

(ii) the prospective payment percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the product of (I) the per unit payment rate established under this subsection for the fiscal year in which the payment unit of service occurs, and (II) the number of such payment units occurring in the cost reporting period.

(B) Fully implemented system

Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title , but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title , the amount of the payment with respect to the operating and capital costs of inpatient hospital services of a rehabilitation facility for a payment unit in a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2002 , or, in the case of a facility making an election under subparagraph (F), for any cost reporting period described in such subparagraph, is equal to the per unit payment rate established under this subsection for the fiscal year in which the payment unit of service occurs.

(C) TEFRA and prospective payment percentages specified

For purposes of subparagraph (A), for a cost reporting period beginning

(i) on or after October 1, 2000 , and before October 1, 2001 , the “TEFRA percentage” is 66⅔ percent and the “prospective payment percentage” is 33⅓ percent; and

(ii) on or after October 1, 2001 , and before October 1, 2002 , the “TEFRA percentage” is 33⅓ percent and the “prospective payment percentage” is 66⅔ percent.

(D) Payment unit

For purposes of this subsection, the term “payment unit” means a discharge.

(E) Construction relating to transfer authority

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from providing for an adjustment to payments to take into account the early transfer of a patient from a rehabilitation facility to another site of care.

(F) Election to apply full prospective payment system

A rehabilitation facility may elect, not later than 30 days before its first cost reporting period for which the payment methodology under this subsection applies to the facility, to have payment made to the facility under this subsection under the provisions of subparagraph (B) (rather than subparagraph (A)) for each cost reporting period to which such payment methodology applies.

(2) Patient case mix groups

(A) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish

(i) classes of patient discharges of rehabilitation facilities by functional-related groups (each in this subsection referred to as a “case mix group”), based on impairment, age, comorbidities, and functional capability of the patient and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate to improve the explanatory power of functional independence measure-function related groups; and

(ii) a method of classifying specific patients in rehabilitation facilities within these groups.

(B) Weighting factors

For each case mix group the Secretary shall assign an appropriate weighting which reflects the relative facility resources used with respect to patients classified within that group compared to patients classified within other groups.

(C) Adjustments for case mix

(i) In general

The Secretary shall from time to time adjust the classifications and weighting factors established under this paragraph as appropriate to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, case mix, number of payment units for which payment is made under this subchapter, and other factors which may affect the relative use of resources. Such adjustments shall be made in a manner so that changes in aggregate payments under the classification system are a result of real changes and are not a result of changes in coding that are unrelated to real changes in case mix.

(ii) Adjustment

Insofar as the Secretary determines that such adjustments for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under the classification system during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of patients that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary shall adjust the per payment unit payment rate for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

(D) Data collection

The Secretary is authorized to require rehabilitation facilities that provide inpatient hospital services to submit such data as the Secretary deems necessary to establish and administer the prospective payment system under this subsection.

(3) Payment rate

(A) In general

The Secretary shall determine a prospective payment rate for each payment unit for which such rehabilitation facility is entitled to receive payment under this subchapter. Subject to subparagraph (B), such rate for payment units occurring during a fiscal year shall be based on the average payment per payment unit under this subchapter for inpatient operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities using the most recent data available (as estimated by the Secretary as of the date of establishment of the system) adjusted

(i) by updating such per-payment-unit amount to the fiscal year involved by the weighted average of the applicable percentage increases provided under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) (for cost reporting periods beginning during the fiscal year) covering the period from the midpoint of the period for such data through the midpoint of fiscal year 2000 and by an increase factor (described in subparagraph (C)) specified by the Secretary for subsequent fiscal years up to the fiscal year involved;

(ii) by reducing such rates by a factor equal to the proportion of payments under this subsection (as estimated by the Secretary) based on prospective payment amounts which are additional payments described in paragraph (4) (relating to outlier and related payments);

(iii) for variations among rehabilitation facilities by area under paragraph (6);

(iv) by the weighting factors established under paragraph (2)(B); and

(v) by such other factors as the Secretary determines are necessary to properly reflect variations in necessary costs of treatment among rehabilitation facilities.

(B) Budget neutral rates

The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts under this subsection for payment units during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 at levels such that, in the Secretary’s estimation, the amount of total payments under this subsection for such fiscal years (including any payment adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (6) but not taking into account any payment adjustment resulting from an election permitted under paragraph (1)(F)) shall be equal to 98 percent for fiscal year 2001 and 100 percent for fiscal year 2002 of the amount of payments that would have been made under this subchapter during the fiscal years for operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities had this subsection not been enacted. In establishing such payment amounts, the Secretary shall consider the effects of the prospective payment system established under this subsection on the total number of payment units from rehabilitation facilities and other factors described in subparagraph (A).

(C) Increase factor

(i) In general

For purposes of this subsection for payment units in each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), the Secretary shall establish an increase factor subject to clauses (ii) and (iii). Such factor shall be based on an appropriate percentage increase in a market basket of goods and services comprising services for which payment is made under this subsection, which may be the market basket percentage increase described in subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii). The increase factor to be applied under this subparagraph for each of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 shall be 0 percent.

(ii) Productivity and other adjustment

Subject to clause (iii), after establishing the increase factor described in clause (i) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor

(I) for fiscal year 2012 and each subsequent fiscal year, by the productivity adjustment described in subsection (b)(3)(B)(xi)(II); and

(II) for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2019, by the other adjustment described in subparagraph (D).  The application of this clause may result in the increase factor under this subparagraph being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this subsection for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

(iii) Special rule for fiscal year 2018

The increase factor to be applied under this subparagraph for fiscal year 2018, after the application of clause (ii), shall be 1 percent.

(D) Other adjustment

For purposes of subparagraph (C)(ii)(II), the other adjustment described in this subparagraph is

(i) for each of fiscal years 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point;

(ii) for each of fiscal years 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point;

(iii) for fiscal year 2014, 0.3 percentage point;

(iv) for each of fiscal years 2015 and 2016, 0.2 percentage point; and

(v) for each of fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, 0.75 percentage point.

(4) Outlier and special payments

(A) Outliers

(i) In general

The Secretary may provide for an additional payment to a rehabilitation facility for patients in a case mix group, based upon the patient being classified as an outlier based on an unusual length of stay, costs, or other factors specified by the Secretary.

(ii) Payment based on marginal cost of care

The amount of such additional payment under clause (i) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i).

(iii) Total payments

The total amount of the additional payments made under this subparagraph for payment units in a fiscal year may not exceed 5 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on prospective payment rates for payment units in that year.

(B) Adjustment

The Secretary may provide for such adjustments to the payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the unique circumstances of rehabilitation facilities located in Alaska and Hawaii.

(5) Publication

The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, on or before August 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), of the classification and weighting factors for case mix groups under paragraph (2) for such fiscal year and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates under this subsection for that fiscal year.

(6) Area wage adjustment

The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of rehabilitation facilities’ costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the prospective payment rates computed under paragraph (3) for area differences in wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the rehabilitation facility compared to the national average wage level for such facilities. Not later than October 1, 2001 (and at least every 36 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of information available to the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing rehabilitation services. Any adjustments or updates made under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregated payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.

(7) Quality reporting

(A) Reduction in update for failure to report

(i) In general

For purposes of fiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year, in the case of a rehabilitation facility that does not submit data to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraphs (C) and (F) with respect to such a fiscal year, after determining the increase factor described in paragraph (3)(C), and after application of subparagraphs (C)(iii) and (D) of paragraph (3), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor for payments for discharges occurring during such fiscal year by 2 percentage points.

(ii) Special rule

The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor described in paragraph (3)(C) being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this subsection for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

(B) Noncumulative application

Any reduction under subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to the fiscal year involved and the Secretary shall not take into account such reduction in computing the payment amount under this subsection for a subsequent fiscal year.

(C) Submission of quality data

Subject to subparagraph (G), for fiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year, each rehabilitation facility shall submit to the Secretary data on quality measures specified under subparagraph (D).
