(5) Required activities

(A) In general

In establishing and operating the network described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(i) utilize applicable interoperability standards as adopted by the Secretary, and in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, through a joint public and private sector process;

(ii) define minimal data elements for such network;

(iii) in collaboration with State, local, and tribal public health officials, integrate and build upon existing State, local, and tribal capabilities, ensuring simultaneous sharing of data, information, and analyses from the network described in paragraph (1) with State, local, and tribal public health agencies;

(iv) in collaboration with State, local, and tribal public health officials, develop procedures and standards for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data that States, regions, or other entities collect and report to the network described in paragraph (1); and

(v) pilot test standards and implementation specifications, consistent with the process described in section 300jj–12(b)(3)(C) of this title , which State, local, Tribal, and territorial public health entities may utilize, on a voluntary basis, as a part of the network.

(B) Public meeting

(i) In general

Not later than 180 days after June 24, 2019 , the Secretary shall convene a public meeting for purposes of discussing and providing input on the potential goals, functions, and uses of the network described in paragraph (1) and incorporating the elements described in paragraph (3)(A).

(ii) Experts

The public meeting shall include representatives of relevant Federal agencies (including representatives from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the National Institute of Standards and Technology); State, local, Tribal, and territorial public health officials; stakeholders with expertise in biosurveillance and situational awareness; stakeholders with expertise in capabilities relevant to biosurveillance and situational awareness, such as experts in informatics and data analytics (including experts in prediction, modeling, or forecasting); and other representatives as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(iii) Topics

Such public meeting shall include a discussion of

(I) data elements, including minimal or essential data elements, that are voluntarily provided for such network, which may include elements from public health and public and private health care entities, to the extent practicable;

(II) standards and implementation specifications that may improve the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data during a public health emergency;

(III) strategies to encourage the access, exchange, and use of information;

(IV) considerations for State, local, Tribal, and territorial capabilities and infrastructure related to data exchange and interoperability;

(V) privacy and security protections provided at the Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial levels, and by nongovernmental stakeholders; and

(VI) opportunities for the incorporation of innovative technologies to improve the network.

(6) Strategy and implementation plan
