##### (d) Repayment

(1) Requirement

(A) In general

No guarantee, including a guarantee for a project receiving financial support or credit enhancements from a State energy financing institution, shall be made unless the Secretary determines that there is reasonable prospect of repayment of the principal and interest on the obligation by the borrower.

(B) Reasonable prospect of repayment

The Secretary shall base a determination of whether there is reasonable prospect of repayment under subparagraph (A) on a comprehensive evaluation of whether the borrower has a reasonable prospect of repaying the guaranteed obligation for the eligible project, including, as applicable, an evaluation of

(i) the strength of the contractual terms of the eligible project (if commercially reasonably available);

(ii) the forecast of noncontractual cash flows supported by market projections from reputable sources, as determined by the Secretary;

(iii) cash sweeps and other structure enhancements;

(iv) the projected financial strength of the borrower

(I) at the time of loan close; and

(II) throughout the loan term after the project is completed;

(v) the financial strength of the investors and strategic partners of the borrower, if applicable; and

(vi) other financial metrics and analyses that are relied on by the private lending community and nationally recognized credit rating agencies, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

(2) Amount

No guarantee shall be made unless the Secretary determines that the amount of the obligation (when combined with amounts available to the borrower from other sources) will be sufficient to carry out the project.

(3) Subordination

The obligation shall be subject to the condition that the obligation, including any reorganization, restructuring, or termination thereof, shall not at any time be subordinate to other financing.
