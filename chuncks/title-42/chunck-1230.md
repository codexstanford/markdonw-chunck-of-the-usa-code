#### § 274k. National Program
##### (d) Functions

(1) Bone marrow functions

With respect to bone marrow, the Program shall

(A) operate a system for identifying, matching, and facilitating the distribution of bone marrow that is suitably matched to candidate patients;

(B) consistent with paragraph (3), permit transplant physicians, other appropriate health care professionals, and patients to search by means of electronic access all available bone marrow donors listed in the Program;

(C) carry out a program for the recruitment of bone marrow donors in accordance with subsection (e), including with respect to increasing the representation of racial and ethnic minority groups (including persons of mixed ancestry) in the enrollment of the Program;

(D) maintain and expand medical contingency response capabilities, in coordination with Federal programs, to prepare for and respond effectively to biological, chemical, or radiological attacks, and other public health emergencies that can damage marrow, so that the capability of supporting patients with marrow damage from disease can be used to support casualties with marrow damage;

(E) carry out informational and educational activities in accordance with subsection (e);

(F) at least annually update information to account for changes in the status of individuals as potential donors of bone marrow;

(G) provide for a system of patient advocacy through the office established under subsection (h);

(H) provide case management services for any potential donor of bone marrow to whom the Program has provided a notice that the potential donor may be suitably matched to a particular patient through the office established under subsection (h);

(I) with respect to searches for unrelated donors of bone marrow that are conducted through the system under subparagraph (A), collect, analyze, and publish data in a standardized electronic format on the number and percentage of patients at each of the various stages of the search process, including data regarding the furthest stage reached, the number and percentage of patients who are unable to complete the search process, and the reasons underlying such circumstances;

(J) support studies and demonstration and outreach projects for the purpose of increasing the number of individuals who are willing to be marrow donors to ensure a genetically diverse donor pool; and

(K) facilitate research with the appropriate Federal agencies to improve the availability, efficiency, safety, and cost of transplants from unrelated donors and the effectiveness of Program operations.

(2) Cord blood functions

(A) In general

With respect to cord blood, the Program shall

(i) operate a system for identifying, matching, and facilitating the distribution of donated cord blood units that are suitably matched to candidate patients and meet all applicable Federal and State regulations (including informed consent and Food and Drug Administration regulations) from a qualified cord blood bank;

(ii) consistent with paragraph (3), allow transplant physicians, other appropriate health care professionals, and patients to search by means of electronic access all available cord blood units made available through the Program;

(iii) allow transplant physicians and other appropriate health care professionals to reserve, as defined by the Secretary, a cord blood unit for transplantation;

(iv) support and expand new and existing studies and demonstration and outreach projects for the purpose of increasing cord blood unit donation and collection from a genetically diverse population and expanding the number of cord blood unit collection sites partnering with cord blood banks receiving a contract under the National Cord Blood Inventory program under section 2 of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, including such studies and projects that focus on

(I) remote collection of cord blood units, consistent with the requirements under the Program and the National Cord Blood Inventory program goal described in section 2(a) of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005; and

(II) exploring novel approaches or incentives to encourage innovative technological advances that could be used to collect cord blood units, consistent with the requirements under the Program and such National Cord Blood Inventory program goal;

(v) provide for a system of patient advocacy through the office established under subsection (h);

(vi) coordinate with the qualified cord blood banks to support informational and educational activities in accordance with subsection (g);

(vii) maintain and expand medical contingency response capabilities, in coordination with Federal programs, to prepare for and respond effectively to biological, chemical, or radiological attacks, and other public health emergencies that can damage marrow, so that the capability of supporting patients with marrow damage from disease can be used to support casualties with marrow damage; and

(viii) with respect to the system under subparagraph (A), collect, analyze, and publish data in a standardized electronic format, as required by the Secretary, on the number and percentage of patients at each of the various stages of the search process, including data regarding the furthest stage reached, the number and percentage of patients who are unable to complete the search process, and the reasons underlying such circumstances.

(B) Efforts to increase collection of high quality cord blood units

In carrying out subparagraph (A)(iv), not later than 1 year after October 8, 2010 , and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall set an annual goal of increasing collections of high quality cord blood units, including remote collection, consistent with the inventory goal described in section 2(a) of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 (referred to in this subparagraph as the “inventory goal”), and shall identify at least one project under subparagraph (A)(iv) to replicate and expand nationwide, as appropriate.

(C) Definition

In this paragraph, the term “remote collection” means the collection of cord blood units at locations that do not have written contracts with cord blood banks for collection support.

(3) Single point of access; standard data

(A) Single point of access

The Secretary shall ensure that health care professionals and patients are able to search electronically for and facilitate access to, in the manner and to the extent defined by the Secretary and consistent with the functions described in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A)(i), cells from bone marrow donors and cord blood units through a single point of access.

(B) Standard data

The Secretary shall require all recipients of contracts under this section to make available a standard dataset for purposes of subparagraph (A) in a standardized electronic format that enables transplant physicians to compare among and between bone marrow donors and cord blood units to ensure the best possible match for the patient.

(4) Definition

The term “qualified cord blood bank” means a cord blood bank that

(A) has obtained all applicable Federal and State licenses, certifications, registrations (including pursuant to the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration), and other authorizations required to operate and maintain a cord blood bank;

(B) has implemented donor screening, cord blood collection practices, and processing methods intended to protect the health and safety of donors and transplant recipients to improve transplant outcomes, including with respect to the transmission of potentially harmful infections and other diseases;

(C) is accredited by an accreditation entity recognized by the Secretary under subsection (b);

(D) has established a system of strict confidentiality to protect the identity and privacy of patients and donors in accordance with existing Federal and State law;
