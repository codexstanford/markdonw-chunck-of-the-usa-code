#### § 18713. Transmission facilitation program
##### (f) Capacity contracts

(1) Purpose

In entering into capacity contracts under subsection (e)(1)(A), the Secretary shall seek to enter into capacity contracts that will encourage other entities to enter into contracts for the transmission capacity of the eligible project.

(2) Payment

The amount paid by the Secretary to an eligible entity under a capacity contract for the right to the use of the transmission capacity of an eligible project shall be

(A) the fair market value for the use of the transmission capacity, as determined by the Secretary, taking into account, as the Secretary determines to be necessary, the comparable value for the use of the transmission capacity of other electric power transmission lines; and

(B) on a schedule and in such divided amounts, which may be a single amount, that the Secretary determines are likely to facilitate construction of the eligible project, taking into account standard industry practice and factors specific to each applicant, including, as applicable

(i) potential review by a State regulatory entity of the revenue requirement of an electric utility; and

(ii) the financial model of an independent transmission developer.

(3) Limitations

A capacity contract shall

(A) be for a term of not more than 40 years; and

(B) be for not more than 50 percent of the total proposed transmission capacity of the applicable eligible project.

(4) Transmission marketing

(A) In general

If the Secretary has not terminated a capacity contract under paragraph (5) before the applicable eligible project enters into service, the Secretary may enter into 1 or more contracts with a third party to market the transmission capacity of the eligible project to which the Secretary holds rights under the capacity contract.

(B) Return

Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall seek to ensure that any contract entered into under subparagraph (A) maximizes the financial return to the Federal Government.

(C) Competitive solicitation

The Secretary shall only select third parties for contracts under this paragraph through a competitive solicitation.

(D) Requirement

The marketing of capacity pursuant to this subsection, including any marketing by a third party under subparagraph (A), shall be undertaken consistent with the requirements of the Federal Power Act ( 16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.).

(5) Termination

(A) In general

The Secretary shall seek to terminate a capacity contract as soon as practicable after determining that sufficient transmission capacity of the eligible project has been secured by other entities to ensure the long-term financial viability of the eligible project, including through 1 or more transfers under subparagraph (B).

(B) Transfer

On payment to the Secretary by a third party for transmission capacity to which the Secretary has rights under a capacity contract, the Secretary may transfer the rights to that transmission capacity to that third party.

(C) Relinquishment

On payment to the Secretary by the applicable eligible entity for transmission capacity to which the Secretary has rights under a capacity contract, the Secretary may relinquish the rights to that transmission capacity to the eligible entity.

(D) Requirement

A payment under subparagraph (B) or (C) shall be in an amount sufficient for the Secretary to recover any remaining costs incurred by the Secretary with respect to the quantity of transmission capacity affected by the transfer under subparagraph (B) or the relinquishment under subparagraph (C), as applicable.

(6) Other Federal capacity positions

The existence of a capacity contract does not preclude a Federal entity, including a Federal power marketing administration, from otherwise securing transmission capacity at any time from an eligible project, to the extent that the Federal entity is authorized to secure that transmission capacity.

(7) Form of financial assistance

Entering into a capacity contract under subsection (e)(1)(A) shall be considered a form of financial assistance described in section 1508.1(q)(1)(vii) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on November 15, 2021 ).

(8) Transmission planning region consultation

Prior to entering into a capacity contract under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the relevant transmission planning region regarding the transmission planning region’s identification of needs, and the Secretary shall minimize, to the extent possible, duplication or conflict with the transmission planning region’s needs determination and selection of projects that meet such needs.
