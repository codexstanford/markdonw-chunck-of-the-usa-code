######## (D) If the deceased individual (on the basis of whose wages and self-employment income a widow or surviving divorced wife is entitled to widow’s insurance benefits under this subsection) was, at any time, entitled to an old-age insurance benefit which was reduced by reason of the application of subsection (q), the widow’s insurance benefit of such widow or surviving divorced wife for any month shall, if the amount of the widow’s insurance benefit of such widow or surviving divorced wife (as determined under subparagraph (A) and after application of subsection (q)) is greater than

(B) the last month for which she was entitled to mother’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual, or

(C) the month in which a previous entitlement to widow’s insurance benefits on the basis of such wages and self-employment income terminated because her disability had ceased, and ending with the month before the month in which she attains age 60, or, if earlier, with the close of the eighty-fourth month following the month with which such period began.
