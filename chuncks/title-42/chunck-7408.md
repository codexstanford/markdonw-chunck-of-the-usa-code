#### § 1395u. Provisions relating to the administration of part B
##### (q) Anesthesia services; counting actual time units

(1)

(A) The Secretary, in consultation with groups representing physicians who furnish anesthesia services, shall establish by regulation a relative value guide for use in all localities in making payment for physician anesthesia services furnished under this part. Such guide shall be designed so as to result in expenditures under this subchapter for such services in an amount that would not exceed the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise occur.

(B) For physician anesthesia services furnished under this part during 1991, the prevailing charge conversion factor used in a locality under this subsection shall, subject to clause (iv), be reduced to the adjusted prevailing charge conversion factor for the locality determined as follows:

(i) The Secretary shall estimate the national weighted average of the prevailing charge conversion factors used under this subsection for services furnished during 1990 after March 31, using the best available data.

(ii) The national weighted average estimated under clause (i) shall be reduced by 7 percent.

(iii) The adjusted prevailing charge conversion factor for a locality is the sum of

(I) the product of (a) the portion of the reduced national weighted average prevailing charge conversion factor computed under clause (ii) which is attributable to physician work and (b) the geographic work index value for the locality (specified in Addendum C to the Model Fee Schedule for Physician Services (published on September 4, 1990 , 55 Federal Register pp. 36238–36243)); and

(II) the product of (a) the remaining portion of the reduced national weighted average prevailing charge conversion factor computed under clause (ii) and (b) the geographic practice cost index value specified in subsection (b)(14)(C)(iv) for the locality. In applying this clause, 70 percent of the prevailing charge conversion factor shall be considered to be attributable to physician work.

(iv) The prevailing charge conversion factor to be applied to a locality under this subparagraph shall not be reduced by more than 15 percent below the prevailing charge conversion factor applied in the locality for the period during 1990 after March 31, but in no case shall the prevailing charge conversion factor be less than 60 percent of the national weighted average of the prevailing charge conversion factors (computed under clause (i)).

(2) For purposes of payment for anesthesia services (whether furnished by physicians or by certified registered nurse anesthetists) under this part, the time units shall be counted based on actual time rather than rounded to full time units.
