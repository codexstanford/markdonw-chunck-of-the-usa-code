#### § 1395rr. End stage renal disease program
##### (f) Experiments, studies, and pilot projects

(1) The Secretary shall initiate and carry out, at selected locations in the United States, pilot projects under which financial assistance in the purchase of new or used durable medical equipment for renal dialysis is provided to individuals suffering from end stage renal disease at the time home dialysis is begun, with provision for a trial period to assure successful adaptation to home dialysis before the actual purchase of such equipment.

(2) The Secretary shall conduct experiments to evaluate methods for reducing the costs of the end stage renal disease program. Such experiments shall include (without being limited to) reimbursement for nurses and dialysis technicians to assist with home dialysis, and reimbursement to family members assisting with home dialysis.

(3) The Secretary shall conduct experiments to evaluate methods of dietary control for reducing the costs of the end stage renal disease program, including (without being limited to) the use of protein-controlled products to delay the necessity for, or reduce the frequency of, dialysis in the treatment of end stage renal disease.

(4) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive study of methods for increasing public participation in kidney donation and other organ donation programs.

(5) The Secretary shall conduct a full and complete study of the reimbursement of physicians for services furnished to patients with end stage renal disease under this subchapter, giving particular attention to the range of payments to physicians for such services, the average amounts of such payments, and the number of hours devoted to furnishing such services to patients at home, in renal disease facilities, in hospitals, and elsewhere.

(6) The Secretary shall conduct a study of the number of patients with end stage renal disease who are not eligible for benefits with respect to such disease under this subchapter (by reason of this section or otherwise), and of the economic impact of such noneligibility of such individuals. Such study shall include consideration of mechanisms whereby governmental and other health plans might be instituted or modified to permit the purchase of actuarially sound coverage for the costs of end stage renal disease.

(7)

(A) The Secretary shall establish protocols on standards and conditions for the reuse of dialyzer filters for those facilities and providers which voluntarily elect to reuse such filters.

(B) With respect to dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 1988 (or July 1, 1988 , with respect to protocols that relate to the reuse of bloodlines), no dialysis facility may reuse dialysis supplies (other than dialyzer filters) unless the Secretary has established a protocol with respect to the reuse of such supplies and the facility follows the protocol so established.

(C) The Secretary shall incorporate protocols established under this paragraph, and the requirement of subparagraph (B), into the requirements for facilities prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(A) and failure to follow such a protocol or requirement subjects such a facility to denial of participation in the program established under this section and to denial of payment for dialysis treatment not furnished in compliance with such a protocol or in violation of such requirement.

(8) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress no later than October 1, 1979 , a full report on the experiments conducted under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (7), and the studies under paragraphs (4), (5), (6), and (7). Such report shall include any recommendations for legislative changes which the Secretary finds necessary or desirable as a result of such experiments and studies.
