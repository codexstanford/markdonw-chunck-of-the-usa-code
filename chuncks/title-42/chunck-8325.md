### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (f) Limitation on Federal participation in medical assistance

(1)

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (4), payment under the preceding provisions of this section shall not be made with respect to any amount expended as medical assistance in a calendar quarter, in any State, for any member of a family the annual income of which exceeds the applicable income limitation determined under this paragraph.

(B)

(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the applicable income limitation with respect to any family is the amount determined, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, to be equivalent to 133⅓ percent of the highest amount which would ordinarily be paid to a family of the same size without any income or resources, in the form of money payments, under the plan of the State approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.

(ii) If the Secretary finds that the operation of a uniform maximum limits payments to families of more than one size, he may adjust the amount otherwise determined under clause (i) to take account of families of different sizes.

(C) The total amount of any applicable income limitation determined under subparagraph (B) shall, if it is not a multiple of $100 or such other amount as the Secretary may prescribe, be rounded to the next higher multiple of $100 or such other amount, as the case may be.

(2)

(A) In computing a family’s income for purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be excluded any costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums or otherwise and regardless of whether such costs are reimbursed under another public program of the State or political subdivision thereof) incurred by such family for medical care or for any other type of remedial care recognized under State law or, (B) notwithstanding section 1396 o of this title at State option, an amount paid by such family, at the family’s option, to the State, provided that the amount, when combined with costs incurred in prior months, is sufficient when excluded from the family’s income to reduce such family’s income below the applicable income limitation described in paragraph (1). The amount of State expenditures for which medical assistance is available under subsection (a)(1) will be reduced by amounts paid to the State pursuant to this subparagraph.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), in the case of a family consisting of only one individual, the “highest amount which would ordinarily be paid” to such family under the State’s plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter shall be the amount determined by the State agency (on the basis of reasonable relationship to the amounts payable under such plan to families consisting of two or more persons) to be the amount of the aid which would ordinarily be payable under such plan to a family (without any income or resources) consisting of one person if such plan provided for aid to such a family.

(4) The limitations on payment imposed by the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any amount expended by a State as medical assistance for any individual described in section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(V), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIV), or  5 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XV), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XXI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XXII), 1396d(p)(1) of this title or for any individual

(A) who is receiving aid or assistance under any plan of the State approved under subchapter I, X, XIV or XVI, or part A of subchapter IV, or with respect to whom supplemental security income benefits are being paid under subchapter XVI, or

(B) who is not receiving such aid or assistance, and with respect to whom such benefits are not being paid, but (i) is eligible to receive such aid or assistance, or to have such benefits paid with respect to him, or (ii) would be eligible to receive such aid or assistance, or to have such benefits paid with respect to him if he were not in a medical institution, or

(C) with respect to whom there is being paid, or who is eligible, or would be eligible if he were not in a medical institution, to have paid with respect to him, a State supplementary payment and is eligible for medical assistance equal in amount, duration, and scope to the medical assistance made available to individuals described in section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title , or who is a PACE program eligible individual enrolled in a PACE program under section 1396u–4 of this title , but only if the income of such individual (as determined under section 1382a of this title , but without regard to subsection (b) thereof) does not exceed 300 percent of the supplemental security income benefit rate established by section 1382(b)(1) of this title , at the time of the provision of the medical assistance giving rise to such expenditure.
