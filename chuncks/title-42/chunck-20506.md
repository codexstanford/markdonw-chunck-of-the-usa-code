(B) It will increase the overall efficiency of the utilization of coal, including energy conversion efficiency and, where applicable, production of products derived from coal.

(C) It will be a more cost-effective technological alternative, based on life cycle capital and operating costs per unit of energy produced and, where applicable, costs per unit of product produced. Priority in selection shall be given to those projects which, in the judgment of the Secretary, best meet one or more of these criteria.
