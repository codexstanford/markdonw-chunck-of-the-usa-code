#### § 18934. Biometrics research and testing
##### (b) Biometrics test program

(1) In general

The Secretary, acting through the Director, shall carry out a test program to provide biometrics vendors the opportunity to test biometric identification technologies across a range of modalities.

(2) Activities

In carrying out the program under this subsection, the Director shall

(A) conduct research and regular testing to improve and benchmark the accuracy, efficacy, and bias of biometric identification technologies, which may include research and testing on demographic variations, capture devices, presentation attack detection, partially occluded or computer generated images, privacy and security designs and controls, template protection, de-identification, and comparison of algorithm, human, and combined algorithm-human recognition capability;

(B) develop an approach for testing software and cloud-based biometrics applications, including remote systems, in Institute test facilities;

(C) establish reference use cases for biometric identification technologies and performance criteria for assessing each use case, including accuracy, efficacy, and bias metrics;

(D) produce public-facing reports of the findings from such testing for a general audience;

(E) develop policies and procedures accounting for the legal and social implications of activities under this paragraph when working with a foreign entity of concern (as such term is defined in section 19221 of this title );

(F) establish procedures to prioritize testing of biometrics identification technologies developed by entities headquartered in the United States; and

(G) conduct such other activities as determined necessary by the Director.
