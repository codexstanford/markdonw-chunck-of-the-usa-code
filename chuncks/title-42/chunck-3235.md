#### § 297a. Student loan fund
##### (c) Regulatory standards applicable to collection of loans

(1) Any standard established by the Secretary by regulation for the collection by schools of nursing of loans made pursuant to loan agreements under this part shall provide that the failure of any such school to collect such loans shall be measured in accordance with this subsection. With respect to the student loan fund established pursuant to such agreements, this subsection may not be construed to require such schools to reimburse such loan fund for loans that became uncollectable prior to 1983.

(2) The measurement of a school’s failure to collect loans made under this part shall be the ratio (stated as a percentage) that the defaulted principal amount outstanding of such school bears to the matured loans of such school.

(3) For purposes of this subsection

(A) the term “default” means the failure of a borrower of a loan made under this part to

(i) make an installment payment when due; or

(ii) comply with any other term of the promissory note for such loan, except that a loan made under this part shall not be considered to be in default if the loan is discharged in bankruptcy or if the school reasonably concludes from written contacts with the borrower that the borrower intends to repay the loan;

(B) the term “defaulted principal amount outstanding” means the total amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached the repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or cancelled) on loans

(i) repayable monthly and in default for at least 120 days; and

(ii) repayable less frequently than monthly and in default for at least 180 days;

(C) the term “grace period” means the period of nine months beginning on the date on which the borrower ceases to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at a school of nursing; and

(D) the term “matured loans” means the total principal amount of all loans made by a school of nursing under this part minus the total principal amount of loans made by such school to students who are

(i) enrolled in a full-time or half-time course of study at such school; or

(ii) in their grace period.
