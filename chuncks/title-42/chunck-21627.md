#### § 16154. Clean hydrogen research and development program
##### (e) Activities

In carrying out the program, the Secretary, in partnership with the private sector, shall conduct activities to advance and support

(1) the establishment of a series of technology cost goals oriented toward achieving the standard of clean hydrogen production developed under section 16166(a) of this title ;

(2) the production of clean hydrogen from diverse energy sources, including

(A) fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration;

(B) hydrogen-carrier fuels (including ethanol and methanol);

(C) renewable energy resources, including biomass;

(D) nuclear energy; and

(E) any other methods the Secretary determines to be appropriate;

(3) the use of clean hydrogen for commercial, industrial, and residential electric power generation;

(4) the use of clean hydrogen in industrial applications, including steelmaking, cement, chemical feedstocks, and process heat;

(5) the use of clean hydrogen for use as a fuel source for both residential and commercial comfort heating and hot water requirements;

(6) the safe and efficient delivery of hydrogen or hydrogen-carrier fuels, including

(A) transmission by pipelines, including retrofitting the existing natural gas transportation infrastructure system to enable a transition to transport and deliver increasing levels of clean hydrogen, clean hydrogen blends, or clean hydrogen carriers;

(B) tanks and other distribution methods; and

(C) convenient and economic refueling of vehicles, locomotives, maritime vessels, or planes

(i) at central refueling stations; or

(ii) through distributed onsite generation;

(7) advanced vehicle, locomotive, maritime vessel, or plane technologies, including

(A) engine and emission control systems;

(B) energy storage, electric propulsion, and hybrid systems;

(C) automotive, locomotive, maritime vessel, or plane materials; and

(D) other advanced vehicle, locomotive, maritime vessel, or plane technologies;

(8) storage of hydrogen or hydrogen-carrier fuels, including the development of materials for safe and economic storage in gaseous, liquid, or solid form;

(9) the development of safe, durable, affordable, and efficient fuel cells, including fuel-flexible fuel cell power systems, improved manufacturing processes, high-temperature membranes, cost-effective fuel processing for natural gas, fuel cell stack and system reliability, low-temperature operation, and cold start capability;

(10) the ability of domestic clean hydrogen equipment manufacturers to manufacture commercially available competitive technologies in the United States;

(11) the use of clean hydrogen in the transportation sector, including in light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles, rail transport, aviation, and maritime applications; and

(12) in coordination with relevant agencies, the development of appropriate, uniform codes and standards for the safe and consistent deployment and commercialization of clean hydrogen production, processing, delivery, and end-use technologies.
