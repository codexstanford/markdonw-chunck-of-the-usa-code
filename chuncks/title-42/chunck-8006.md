(II) states in substance that individuals may be eligible for benefits under the State medicaid program under subchapter XIX and that such individuals who are entitled to benefits under that program usually do not need a medicare supplemental policy and that benefits and premiums under any such policy shall be suspended upon request of the policyholder during the period (of not longer than 24 months) of entitlement to benefits under such subchapter and may be reinstituted upon loss of such entitlement, and

(II) Subclause (I) shall not apply in the case of an individual who has a medicare supplemental policy, if the individual indicates in writing, as part of the application for purchase, that the policy being purchased replaces such other policy and indicates an intent to terminate the policy being replaced when the new policy becomes effective and the issuer or seller certifies in writing that such policy will not, to the best of the issuer’s or seller’s knowledge, duplicate coverage (taking into account any such replacement).

(III) If the statement required by clause (i) is obtained and indicates that the individual is entitled to any medical assistance under subchapter XIX, the sale of the policy is not in violation of clause (i) (insofar as such clause relates to such medical assistance), if (aa) a State medicaid plan under such subchapter pays the premiums for the policy, (bb) in the case of a qualified medicare beneficiary described in section 1396d(p)(1) of this title , the policy provides for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs, or (cc) the only medical assistance to which the individual is entitled under the State plan is medicare cost sharing described in section 1396d(p)(3)(A)(ii) of this title .

(A) Whoever knowingly, directly or through his agent, mails or causes to be mailed any matter for a prohibited purpose (as determined under subparagraph (B)) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each such prohibited act.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a prohibited purpose means the advertising, solicitation, or offer for sale of a medicare supplemental policy, or the delivery of such a policy, in or into any State in which such policy has not been approved by the State commissioner or superintendent of insurance.

(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of a person who mails or causes to be mailed a medicare supplemental policy into a State if such person has ascertained that the party insured under such policy to whom (or on whose behalf) such policy is mailed is located in such State on a temporary basis.

(D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of a person who mails or causes to be mailed a duplicate copy of a medicare supplemental policy previously issued to the party to whom (or on whose behalf) such duplicate copy is mailed.

(E) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of an issuer who mails or causes to be mailed a policy, certificate, or other matter solely to comply with the requirements of subsection (q).

(5) The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to civil money penalties under paragraphs (1), (2), (3)(A), and (4)(A) in the same manner as such provisions apply to penalties and proceedings under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .
