#### § 1320a–1. Limitation on use of Federal funds for capital expenditures
##### (j) Capital expenditure review exception for eligible organization health care facilities

A capital expenditure made by or on behalf of a health care facility shall not be subject to review pursuant to this section if 75 percent of the patients who can reasonably be expected to use the service with respect to which the capital expenditure is made will be individuals enrolled in an eligible organization as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title , and if the Secretary determines that such capital expenditure is for services and facilities which are needed by such organization in order to operate efficiently and economically and which are not otherwise readily accessible to such organization because

(1) the facilities do not provide common services at the same site (as usually provided by the organization),

(2) the facilities are not available under a contract of reasonable duration,

(3) full and equal medical staff privileges in the facilities are not available,

(4) arrangements with such facilities are not administratively feasible, or

(5) the purchase of such services is more costly than if the organization provided the services directly.
