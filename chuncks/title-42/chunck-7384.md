######## (B) The Secretary shall publish notice of a proposed determination under paragraph (8)(B) in the Federal Register
######### (ii) For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage specified in this clause is

(I) 15 percent, in the case of a prevailing charge otherwise recognized (without regard to this paragraph and determined without regard to physician specialty) that is at least 150 percent of the weighted national average (as determined by the Secretary) of such prevailing charges for such procedure for all localities in the United States for 1987;

(II) 0 percent, in the case of a prevailing charge that does not exceed 85 percent of such weighted national average; and

(III) in the case of any other prevailing charge, a percent determined on the basis of a straight-line sliding scale, equal to 3 ⁄ 13 of a percentage point for each percent by which the prevailing charge exceeds 85 percent of such weighted national average.

(iii) In no case shall the reduction under clause (i) for a procedure result in a prevailing charge in a locality for 1988 which is less than 85 percent of the Secretary’s estimate of the weighted national average of such prevailing charges for such procedure for all localities in the United States for 1987 (based upon the best available data and determined without regard to physician specialty) after making the reduction described in clause (i)(I).

(B) The procedures described in this subparagraph are as follows: bronchoscopy, carpal tunnel repair, cataract surgery (including subsequent insertion of an intraocular lens), coronary artery bypass surgery, diagnostic and/or therapeutic dilation and curettage, knee arthroscopy, knee arthroplasty, pacemaker implantation surgery, total hip replacement, suprapubic prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

(C) In the case of a reduction in the reasonable charge for a physicians’ service under subparagraph (A), if a nonparticipating physician furnishes the service to an individual entitled to benefits under this part, after the effective date of such reduction, the physician’s actual charge is subject to a limit under subsection (j)(1)(D).

(D) There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title or otherwise of any determination under subparagraph (A) or under paragraph (11)(B)(ii).
