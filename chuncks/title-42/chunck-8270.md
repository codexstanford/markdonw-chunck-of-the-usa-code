### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396a. State plans for medical assistance
##### (i) Termination of certification for participation of and suspension of State payments to intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded

(1) In addition to any other authority under State law, where a State determines that a  13 intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded which is certified for participation under its plan no longer substantially meets the requirements for such a facility under this subchapter and further determines that the facility’s deficiencies

(A) immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State shall provide for the termination of the facility’s certification for participation under the plan and may provide, or

(B) do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State may, in lieu of providing for terminating the facility’s certification for participation under the plan, establish alternative remedies if the State demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that the alternative remedies are effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies, and may provide that no payment will be made under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to such facility after a date specified by the State.

(2) The State shall not make such a decision with respect to a facility until the facility has had a reasonable opportunity, following the initial determination that it no longer substantially meets the requirements for such a facility under this subchapter, to correct its deficiencies, and, following this period, has been given reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.

(3) The State’s decision to deny payment may be made effective only after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be provided for by the State, and its effectiveness shall terminate (A) when the State finds that the facility is in substantial compliance (or is making good faith efforts to achieve substantial compliance) with the requirements for such a facility under this subchapter, or (B) in the case described in paragraph (1)(B), with the end of the eleventh month following the month such decision is made effective, whichever occurs first. If a facility to which clause (B) of the previous sentence applies still fails to substantially meet the provisions of the respective section on the date specified in such clause, the State shall terminate such facility’s certification for participation under the plan effective with the first day of the first month following the month specified in such clause.
