#### § 1395w–114b. Manufacturer rebate for certain drugs with prices increasing faster than inflation
##### (b) Rebate amount

(1) In general

(A) Calculation

For purposes of this section, the amount specified in this subsection for a dosage form and strength with respect to a part D rebatable drug and applicable period is, subject to subparagraph (C), paragraph (5)(B), and paragraph (6), the estimated amount equal to the product of

(i) subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the total number of units of such dosage form and strength for each rebatable covered part D drug dispensed under this part during the applicable period; and

(ii) the amount (if any) by which

(I) the annual manufacturer price (as determined in paragraph (2)) paid for such dosage form and strength with respect to such part D rebatable drug for the period; exceeds

(II) the inflation-adjusted payment amount determined under paragraph (3) for such dosage form and strength with respect to such part D rebatable drug for the period.

(B) Excluded units

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), beginning with plan year 2026, the Secretary shall exclude from the total number of units for a dosage form and strength with respect to a part D rebatable drug, with respect to an applicable period, units of each dosage form and strength of such part D rebatable drug for which the manufacturer provides a discount under the program under section 256b of this title .

(C) Reduction or waiver for shortages and severe supply chain disruptions

The Secretary shall reduce or waive the amount under subparagraph (A) with respect to a part D rebatable drug and an applicable period

(i) in the case of a part D rebatable drug that is described as currently in shortage on the shortage list in effect under section 356e of title 21 at any point during the applicable period;

(ii) in the case of a generic part D rebatable drug (described in subsection (g)(1)(C)(ii)) or a biosimilar (defined as a biological product licensed under section 262(k) of this title ), when the Secretary determines there is a severe supply chain disruption during the applicable period, such as that caused by a natural disaster or other unique or unexpected event; and

(iii) in the case of a generic Part  1 D rebatable drug (as so described), if the Secretary determines that without such reduction or waiver, the drug is likely to be described as in shortage on such shortage list during a subsequent applicable period.

(2) Determination of annual manufacturer price

The annual manufacturer price determined under this paragraph for a dosage form and strength, with respect to a part D rebatable drug and an applicable period, is the sum of the products of

(A) the average manufacturer price (as defined in subsection (g)(6)) of such dosage form and strength, as calculated for a unit of such drug, with respect to each of the calendar quarters of such period; and

(B) the ratio of

(i) the total number of units of such dosage form and strength reported under section 1396r–8 of this title with respect to each such calendar quarter of such period; to

(ii) the total number of units of such dosage form and strength reported under section 1396r–8 of this title with respect to such period, as determined by the Secretary.

(3) Determination of inflation-adjusted payment amount

The inflation-adjusted payment amount determined under this paragraph for a dosage form and strength with respect to a part D rebatable drug for an applicable period, subject to paragraph (5), is

(A) the benchmark period manufacturer price determined under paragraph (4) for such dosage form and strength with respect to such drug and period; increased by

(B) the percentage by which the applicable period CPI–U (as defined in subsection (g)(5)) for the period exceeds the benchmark period CPI–U (as defined in subsection (g)(4)).

(4) Determination of benchmark period manufacturer price

The benchmark period manufacturer price determined under this paragraph for a dosage form and strength, with respect to a part D rebatable drug and an applicable period, is the sum of the products of

(A) the average manufacturer price (as defined in subsection (g)(6)) of such dosage form and strength, as calculated for a unit of such drug, with respect to each of the calendar quarters of the payment amount benchmark period (as defined in subsection (g)(3)); and

(B) the ratio of

(i) the total number of units reported under section 1396r–8 of this title of such dosage form and strength with respect to each such calendar quarter of such payment amount benchmark period; to

(ii) the total number of units reported under section 1396r–8 of this title of such dosage form and strength with respect to such payment amount benchmark period.

(5) Special treatment of certain drugs and exemption

(A) Subsequently approved drugs

In the case of a part D rebatable drug first approved or licensed by the Food and Drug Administration after October 1, 2021 , subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) shall be applied as if the term “payment amount benchmark period” were defined under subsection (g)(3) as the first calendar year beginning after the day on which the drug was first marketed and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) shall be applied as if the term “benchmark period CPI–U” were defined under subsection (g)(4) as if the reference to “January 2021” under such subsection were a reference to “January of the first year beginning after the date on which the drug was first marketed”.

(B) Treatment of new formulations

(i) In general

In the case of a part D rebatable drug that is a line extension of a part D rebatable drug that is an oral solid dosage form, the Secretary shall establish a formula for determining the rebate amount under paragraph (1) and the inflation adjusted payment amount under paragraph (3) with respect to such part D rebatable drug and an applicable period, consistent with the formula applied under subsection (c)(2)(C) of section 1396r–8 of this title for determining a rebate obligation for a rebate period under such section.

(ii) Line extension defined

In this subparagraph, the term “line extension” means, with respect to a part D rebatable drug, a new formulation of the drug, such as an extended release formulation, but does not include an abuse-deterrent formulation of the drug (as determined by the Secretary), regardless of whether such abuse-deterrent formulation is an extended release formulation.

(C) Selected drugs

In the case of a part D rebatable drug that is a selected drug (as defined in section 1320f–1(c) of this title ) with respect to a price applicability period (as defined in section 1320f(b)(2) of this title ), in the case such drug is no longer considered to be a selected drug under section 1320f–1(c) of this title , for each applicable period (as defined under subsection (g)(7)) beginning after the price applicability period with respect to such drug, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) shall be applied as if the term “payment amount benchmark period” were defined under subsection (g)(3) as the last year beginning during such price applicability period with respect to such selected drug and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) shall be applied as if the term “benchmark period CPI–U” were defined under subsection (g)(4) as if the reference to “January 2021” under such subsection were a reference to “January of the last year beginning during such price applicability period with respect to such drug”.

(6) Reconciliation in case of revised information

The Secretary shall provide for a method and process under which, in the case where a PDP sponsor of a prescription drug plan or an MA organization offering an MA–PD plan submits revisions to the number of units of a rebatable covered part D drug dispensed, the Secretary determines, pursuant to such revisions, adjustments, if any, to the calculation of the amount specified in this subsection for a dosage form and strength with respect to such part D rebatable drug and an applicable period and reconciles any overpayments or underpayments in amounts paid as rebates under this subsection. Any identified underpayment shall be rectified by the manufacturer not later than 30 days after the date of receipt from the Secretary of information on such underpayment.
