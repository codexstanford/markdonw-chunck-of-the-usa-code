##### (s) Coverage for pre-existing conditions
######## (A) The issuer of a medicare supplemental policy

(i) may not deny or condition the issuance or effectiveness of a medicare supplemental policy described in subparagraph (C) that is offered and is available for issuance to new enrollees by such issuer;

(ii) may not discriminate in the pricing of such policy, because of health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, or medical condition; and

(iii) may not impose an exclusion of benefits based on a preexisting condition under such policy, in the case of an individual described in subparagraph (B) who seeks to enroll under the policy during the period specified in subparagraph (E) and who submits evidence of the date of termination or disenrollment along with the application for such medicare supplemental policy.

(B) An individual described in this subparagraph is an individual described in any of the following clauses:

(i) The individual is enrolled under an employee welfare benefit plan that provides health benefits that supplement the benefits under this subchapter and the plan terminates or ceases to provide all such supplemental health benefits to the individual.

(ii) The individual is enrolled with a Medicare+Choice organization under a Medicare+Choice plan under part C, and there are circumstances permitting discontinuance of the individual’s election of the plan under the first sentence of section 1395w–21(e)(4) of this title or the individual is 65 years of age or older and is enrolled with a PACE provider under section 1395eee of this title , and there are circumstances that would permit the discontinuance of the individual’s enrollment with such provider under circumstances that are similar to the circumstances that would permit discontinuance of the individual’s election under the first sentence of such section if such individual were enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan.

(iii) The individual is enrolled with an eligible organization under a contract under section 1395mm of this title , a similar organization operating under demonstration project authority, effective for periods before April 1, 1999 , with an organization under an agreement under section 1395 l (a)(1)(A) of this title, or with an organization under a policy described in subsection (t), and such enrollment ceases under the same circumstances that would permit discontinuance of an individual’s election of coverage under the first sentence of section 1395w–21(e)(4) of this title and, in the case of a policy described in subsection (t), there is no provision under applicable State law for the continuation or conversion of coverage under such policy.

(iv) The individual is enrolled under a medicare supplemental policy under this section and such enrollment ceases because

(I) of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the issuer or because of other involuntary termination of coverage or enrollment under such policy and there is no provision under applicable State law for the continuation or conversion of such coverage;

(II) the issuer of the policy substantially violated a material provision of the policy; or

(III) the issuer (or an agent or other entity acting on the issuer’s behalf) materially misrepresented the policy’s provisions in marketing the policy to the individual.

(v) The individual

(I) was enrolled under a medicare supplemental policy under this section,

(II) subsequently terminates such enrollment and enrolls, for the first time, with any Medicare+Choice organization under a Medicare+Choice plan under part C, any eligible organization under a contract under section 1395mm of this title , any similar organization operating under demonstration project authority, any PACE provider under section 1395eee of this title , or any policy described in subsection (t), and

(III) the subsequent enrollment under subclause (II) is terminated by the enrollee during any period within the first 12 months of such enrollment (during which the enrollee is permitted to terminate such subsequent enrollment under section 1395w–21(e) of this title ).

(vi) The individual, upon first becoming eligible for benefits under part A at age 65, enrolls in a Medicare+ÐChoice plan under part C or in a PACE program under section 1395eee of this title , and disenrolls from such plan or such program by not later than 12 months after the effective date of such enrollment.

(C)

(i) Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), a medicare supplemental policy described in this subparagraph is a medicare supplemental policy which has a benefit package classified as “A”, “B”, “C”, or “F” under the standards established under subsection (p)(2).

(ii)

(I) Subject to subclause (II), only for purposes of an individual described in subparagraph (B)(v), a medicare supplemental policy described in this subparagraph is the same medicare supplemental policy referred to in such subparagraph in which the individual was most recently previously enrolled, if available from the same issuer, or, if not so available, a policy described in clause (i).

(II) If the medicare supplemental policy referred to in subparagraph (B)(v) was a medigap Rx policy (as defined in subsection (v)(6)(A)), a medicare supplemental policy described in this subparagraph is such policy in which the individual was most recently enrolled as modified under subsection (v)(2)(C)(i) or, at the election of the individual, a policy referred to in subsection (v)(3)(A)(i).

(iii) Only for purposes of an individual described in subparagraph (B)(vi) and subject to subsection (v)(1), a medicare supplemental policy described in this subparagraph shall include any medicare supplemental policy.

(iv) For purposes of applying this paragraph in the case of a State that provides for offering of benefit packages other than under the classification referred to in clause (i), the references to benefit packages in such clause are deemed references to comparable benefit packages offered in such State.

(D) At the time of an event described in subparagraph (B) because of which an individual ceases enrollment or loses coverage or benefits under a contract or agreement, policy, or plan, the organization that offers the contract or agreement, the insurer offering the policy, or the administrator of the plan, respectively, shall notify the individual of the rights of the individual under this paragraph, and obligations of issuers of medicare supplemental policies, under subparagraph (A).
