### CHAPTER 161— DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
#### § 18649. Isotope research, development, and production
##### (b) Program

The Director shall

(1) carry out, in coordination with other relevant programs across the Department, a program

(A) for the production of critical radioactive and stable isotopes, including the development of techniques to produce isotopes, that the Secretary determines are needed and of sufficient quality and quantity for research, medical, industrial, or related purposes;

(B) for the production of critical radioactive and stable isotopes that are in short supply or projected to be in short supply in the future, including byproducts, surplus materials, and related isotope services;

(C) to maintain and enhance the infrastructure required to produce and supply critical radioactive and stable isotope products and related services;

(D) to conduct research and development on new and improved isotope production and processing techniques that can make critical radioactive and stable isotopes available for research and application as soon as possible while assisting in workforce development;

(E) to reduce domestic dependency on the foreign supply of critical radioactive and stable isotopes to ensure national preparedness; and

(F) to the maximum extent practicable, in accordance with

(i) evidence-based reports, such as the 2015 report of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee entitled “Meeting Isotope Needs and Capturing Opportunities for the Future”; and

(ii) assessments of isotope supply chains, including the assessment described in paragraph (3), any reports submitted pursuant to subsection (d), and other current and future assessments;

(2) ensure that isotope production activities carried out under this subsection are consistent with the statement of policy entitled “Policies and Procedures for Transfer of Commercial Radioisotope Production and Distribution to Private Industry” (30 Fed. Reg. 3247 ( March 9, 1965 ));

(3) assess the domestic requirements of current and emerging critical radioactive and stable isotopes and associated applications, including by consulting end-users, to identify areas that may require Federal investment for expedited development of domestic production capacity for those isotopes, including through public-private partnerships, as appropriate;

(4) ensure that actions taken by the Department do not interfere with, delay, compete with, or otherwise adversely affect efforts by the private sector to make available or otherwise facilitate the supply of critical radioactive and stable isotopes, including efforts under existing agreements between the Department or contractors of the Department and the private sector; and

(5) in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, assess options for demonstrating the production of critical radioactive and stable isotopes in research, test, or commercial nuclear reactors and accelerators, including reactors and accelerators operated at universities.
