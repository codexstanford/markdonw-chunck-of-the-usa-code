Within ninety days from the date of his receipt of the report and recommendations submitted by the Commission under section 7941 of this title , notwithstanding the limitations contained in section 7911(6)(A) and in section 7925(a) of this title , if the Commission determines, based on such study, that such sites cannot be regulated and controlled by the State or the Commission in the manner described in section 7941 of this title , the Secretary may designate either or both of the sites referred to in section 7941 of this title as a processing site for purposes of subchapter I.
