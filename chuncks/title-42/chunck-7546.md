#### § 1395w–27. Contracts with Medicare+Choice organizations
##### (f) Prompt payment by Medicare+Choice organization

(1) Requirement

A contract under this part shall require a Medicare+Choice organization to provide prompt payment (consistent with the provisions of sections 1395h(c)(2) and 1395u(c)(2) of this title) of claims submitted for services and supplies furnished to enrollees pursuant to the contract, if the services or supplies are not furnished under a contract between the organization and the provider or supplier (or in the case of a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan, if a claim is submitted to such organization by an enrollee).

(2) Secretary’s option to bypass noncomplying organization

In the case of a Medicare+Choice eligible organization which the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, has failed to make payments of amounts in compliance with paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide for direct payment of the amounts owed to providers and suppliers (or, in the case of a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan, amounts owed to the enrollees) for covered services and supplies furnished to individuals enrolled under this part under the contract. If the Secretary provides for the direct payments, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate reduction in the amount of payments otherwise made to the organization under this part to reflect the amount of the Secretary’s payments (and the Secretary’s costs in making the payments).
