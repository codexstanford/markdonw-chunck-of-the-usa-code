#### § 2153c. Renegotiation of agreements for cooperation
##### (a) Application to existing agreements of undertakings required of new agreements after March 10, 1978

The President shall initiate a program immediately to renegotiate agreements for cooperation in effect on March 10, 1978 , or otherwise to obtain the agreement of parties to such agreements for cooperation to the undertakings that would be required for new agreements under the 1954 Act. To the extent that an agreement for cooperation in effect on March 10, 1978 , with a cooperating party contains provisions equivalent to any or all of the criteria set forth in section 127 of the 1954 Act [ 42 U.S.C. 2156 ] with respect to materials and equipment transferred pursuant thereto or with respect to any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use of any such material or equipment, any renegotiated agreement with that cooperating party shall continue to contain an equivalent provision with respect to such transferred materials and equipment and such special nuclear material. To the extent that an agreement for cooperation in effect on March 10, 1978 , with a cooperating party does not contain provisions with respect to any nuclear materials and equipment which have previously been transferred under an agreement for cooperation with the United States and which are under the jurisdiction or control of the cooperating party and with respect to any special nuclear material which is used in or produced through the use thereof and which is under the jurisdiction or control of the cooperating party, which are equivalent to any or all of those required for new and amended agreements for cooperation under section 123 a. of the 1954 Act [ 42 U.S.C. 2153(a) ], the President shall vigorously seek to obtain the application of such provisions with respect to such nuclear materials and equipment and such special nuclear material. Nothing in this Act or in the 1954 Act shall be deemed to relinquish any rights which the United States may have under any agreement for cooperation in force on March 10, 1978 .
