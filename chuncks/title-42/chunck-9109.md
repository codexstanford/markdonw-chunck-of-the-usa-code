#### § 1437v. Demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance grants for projects
##### (e) Application and selection

(1) Application

An application for a grant under this section shall demonstrate the appropriateness of the proposal in the context of the local housing market relative to other alternatives, and shall include such other information and be submitted at such time and in accordance with such procedures, as the Secretary shall prescribe.

(2) Selection criteria

The Secretary shall establish criteria for the award of grants under this section and shall include among the factors

(A) the relationship of the grant to the public housing agency plan for the applicant and how the grant will result in a revitalized site that will enhance the neighborhood in which the project is located and enhance economic opportunities for residents;

(B) the capability and record of the applicant public housing agency, or any alternative management entity for the agency, for managing redevelopment or modernization projects, meeting construction timetables, and obligating amounts in a timely manner;

(C) the extent to which the applicant could undertake such activities without a grant under this section;

(D) the extent of involvement of residents, State and local governments, private service providers, financing entities, and developers, in the development and ongoing implementation of a revitalization program for the project, except that the Secretary may not award a grant under this section unless the applicant has involved affected public housing residents at the beginning and during the planning process for the revitalization program, prior to submission of an application;

(E) the need for affordable housing in the community;

(F) the supply of other housing available and affordable to families receiving tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title ;

(G) the amount of funds and other resources to be leveraged by the grant;

(H) the extent of the need for, and the potential impact of, the revitalization program;

(I) the extent to which the plan minimizes permanent displacement of current residents of the public housing site who wish to remain in or return to the revitalized community and provides for community and supportive services to residents prior to any relocation;

(J) the extent to which the plan sustains or creates more project-based housing units available to persons eligible for public housing in markets where the plan shows there is demand for the maintenance or creation of such units;

(K) the extent to which the plan gives to existing residents priority for occupancy in dwelling units which are public housing dwelling units, or for residents who can afford to live in other units, priority for those units in the revitalized community; and

(L) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.

(3) Applicability of selection criteria

The Secretary may determine not to apply certain of the selection criteria established pursuant to paragraph (2) when awarding grants for demolition only, tenant-based assistance only, or other specific categories of revitalization activities. This section may not be construed to require any application for a grant under this section to include demolition of public housing or to preclude use of grant amounts for rehabilitation or rebuilding of any housing on an existing site.
