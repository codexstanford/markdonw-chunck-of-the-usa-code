#### § 1761. Summer food service program for children
##### (l) Food service management companies; subcontracts; assignments, conditions and limitations; meal capacity information in bids subject to review; registration; record, availability to States; small and minority-owned businesses for supplies and services; contracts: standard form, bid and contract procedures, bonding requirements and exemption, review by States, collusive bidding safeguards

(1) Service institutions may contract on a competitive basis with food service management companies for the furnishing of meals or management of the entire food service under the program, except that a food service management company entering into a contract with a service institution under this section may not subcontract with a single company for the total meal, with or without milk, or for the assembly of the meal. The Secretary shall prescribe additional conditions and limitations governing assignment of all or any part of a contract entered into by a food service management company under this section. Any food service management company shall, in its bid, provide the service institution information as to its meal capacity.

(2) Each State may provide for the registration of food service management companies.

(3) In accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, positive efforts shall be made by service institutions to use small businesses and minority-owned businesses as sources of supplies and services. Such efforts shall afford those sources the maximum feasible opportunity to compete for contracts using program funds.

(4) Each State, with the assistance of the Secretary, shall establish a standard form of contract for use by service institutions and food service management companies. The Secretary shall prescribe requirements governing bid and contract procedures for acquisition of the services of food service management companies, including, but not limited to, bonding requirements (which may provide exemptions applicable to contracts of $100,000 or less), procedures for review of contracts by States, and safeguards to prevent collusive bidding activities between service institutions and food service management companies.
