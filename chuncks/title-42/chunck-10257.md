#### § 1862s–8. Innovation Corps
##### (b) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) commercialization of federally funded research can improve the Nation’s competitiveness, grow the economy, and benefit society;

(2) I-Corps is a useful tool in promoting the commercialization of federally funded research by training researchers funded by the Foundation in entrepreneurship and commercialization;

(3) I-Corps should continue to build a network of entrepreneurs, educators, mentors, and institutions and support specialized education and training;

(4) researchers other than those funded by the Foundation may also benefit from the education and training described in paragraph (3); and

(5) I-Corps should continue to promote a strong innovation system by investing in and supporting female entrepreneurs through mentorship, education, and training because they are historically underrepresented in entrepreneurial fields.
