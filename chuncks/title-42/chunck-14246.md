##### (a) Assessments by Water Resources Council of water resource requirements and water supply availability for nonnuclear energy technologies; preparation requirements

The Water Resources Council shall undertake assessments of water resource requirements and water supply availability for any nonnuclear energy technology and any probable combinations of technologies which are the subject of Federal research and development efforts authorized by this chapter, and the commercial development of which could have significant impacts on water resources. In the preparation of its assessment, the Council shall

(1) utilize to the maximum extent practicable data on water supply and demand available in the files of member agencies of the Council;

(2) collect and compile any additional data it deems necessary for complete and accurate assessments;

(3) give full consideration to the constraints upon availability imposed by treaty, compact, court decree, State water laws, and water rights granted pursuant to State and Federal law;

(4) assess the effects of development of such technology on water quality;

(5) include estimates of cost associated with production and management of the required water supply, and the cost of disposal of waste water generated by the proposed facility or process;

(6) assess the environmental, social, and economic impact of any change in use of currently utilized water resource that may be required by the proposed facility or process; and

(7) consult with the Council on Environmental Quality.
