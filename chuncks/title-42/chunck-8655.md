In the case of a part D eligible individual (as defined in section 1395w–101(a)(3)(A) of this title ) who is described in subsection (c)(6)(A)(ii), notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, medical assistance is not available under this subchapter for such drugs (or for any cost-sharing respecting such drugs), and the rules under this subchapter relating to the provision of medical assistance for such drugs shall not apply. The provision of benefits with respect to such drugs shall not be considered as the provision of care or services under the plan under this subchapter.
