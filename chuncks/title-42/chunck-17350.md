#### § 8512. State emergency conservation plan
##### (a) State emergency conservation plans

(1)

(A) Not later than 45 days after the date of the publication of an energy conservation target for a State under section 8511(b) of this title , the Governor of that State shall submit to the Secretary a State emergency conservation plan designed to meet or exceed the emergency conservation target in effect for that State under section 8511(a) of this title . Such plan shall contain such information as the Secretary may reasonably require. At any time, the Governor may, with the approval of the Secretary, amend a plan established under this section.

(B) The Secretary may, for good cause shown, extend to a specific date the period for the submission of any State’s plan under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register notice of that extension together with the reasons therefor.

(2) Each State is encouraged to submit to the Secretary a State emergency conservation plan as soon as possible after November 5, 1979 , and in advance of such publication of any such target. The Secretary may tentatively approve such a plan in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this subchapter such tentative approval shall not be construed to result in a delegation of Federal authority to administer or enforce any measure contained in a State plan.
