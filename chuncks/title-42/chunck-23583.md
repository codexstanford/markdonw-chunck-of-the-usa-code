#### § 18932. Greenhouse gas measurement research
##### (b) Activities

In carrying out such a program, the Director may

(1) conduct research and testing to improve the accuracy, efficacy, and reliability of the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions at a range of scales that covers direct measurement at the component or process level through atmospheric observations;

(2) conduct research to create novel measurement technologies and techniques for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions;

(3) convene and engage with relevant Federal agencies and stakeholders to establish common definitions and characterizations for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account any existing United States and international technical standards and guidance;

(4) conduct outreach and coordination to share technical expertise with relevant industry and nonindustry stakeholders and standards development organizations to

(A) assist such entities in the development and adoption of best practices and technical standards for greenhouse gas emissions measurements; and

(B) promote consistency and traceability in international reference standards and central calibration laboratories;

(5) in coordination with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Secretary of Energy, develop such standard reference materials as the Director determines is necessary to further the development of such technical standards, taking into account any existing United States or international standards;

(6) coordinate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to ensure data are managed, stewarded, and archived at all levels and promote full and open exchange at Federal and State levels, and with academia, industry, and other users; and

(7) coordinate with international partners, including international standards organizations, to maintain global greenhouse gas measurement technical standards.
