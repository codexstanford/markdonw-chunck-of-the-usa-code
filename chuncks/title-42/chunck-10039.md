#### § 1862b. Establishment of Program
##### (c) Criteria for award of funds

Criteria for the award of funds to any institution for a project under the Program shall include

(1) the quality of the research and training to be carried out in the facility or facilities involved;

(2) the need for the proposed repair, renovation, or, in exceptional cases, replacement based on an analysis of the age and condition of existing research facilities and equipment;

(3) the congruence of the institution’s research and training activities with the future research needs of the Nation and the research mission of the Foundation;

(4) the contribution that the project will make toward meeting national, regional, and institutional research and related training needs;

(5) in the case of an institution that historically has received relatively little Federal research and development funding, the contribution the proposed project will make to improving the institution’s academic scientific and engineering infrastructure and broadening the Nation’s science and engineering base; and

(6) the impact of the award on the overall geographic distribution of awards made under the Program, with the objective of avoiding undue concentration of awards.
