#### § 17194. Enhanced geothermal systems research and development
##### (d) Enhanced geothermal systems demonstrations

(1) In general

Beginning on December 27, 2020 , the Secretary, in collaboration with industry partners, institutions of higher education, and the national laboratories, shall support an initiative for demonstration of enhanced geothermal systems for power production or direct use.

(2) Projects

(A) In general

Under the initiative described in paragraph (1), 4 demonstration projects shall be carried out in locations that are potentially commercially viable for enhanced geothermal systems development, while also considering environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the Secretary.

(B) Requirements

Demonstration projects under subparagraph (A) shall

(i) collectively demonstrate

(I) different geologic settings, such as hot sedimentary aquifers, layered geologic systems, supercritical systems, and basement rock systems; and

(II) a variety of development techniques, including open hole and cased hole completions, differing well orientations, and stimulation and nonstimulation mechanisms; and

(ii) to the extent practicable, use existing sites where subsurface characterization or geothermal energy integration analysis has been conducted.

(C) Eastern demonstration

Not fewer than 1 of the demonstration projects carried out under subparagraph (A) shall be located an area east of the Mississippi River that is suitable for enhanced geothermal demonstration for power, heat, or a combination of power and heat.

(D) Milestone-based demonstration projects

The Secretary may carry out demonstration projects under this subsection as a milestone-based demonstration project under section 7256c of this title .

(3) Funding

Out of funds authorized to be appropriated under section 17202 of this title , there shall be made available to the Secretary to carry out the demonstration activities under this subsection $21,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025.
