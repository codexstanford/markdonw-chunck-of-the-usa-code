(B) Non-Federal contribution

In providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out such a program, each recipient of a grant or contract under this part

(i) shall provide for such share through a payment in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including facilities, equipment, or services; and

(ii) may provide for such share through State sources or local sources, including private funds or donated services.
