### CHAPTER 162— ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE
#### § 18773. Expansion of energy consumption surveys
##### (b) Requirements

(1) In general

In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall

(A) increase the scope and frequency of data collection on energy end uses and services;

(B) use new data collection methods and tools in order to obtain more comprehensive data and reduce the burden on survey respondents, including by

(i) accessing other existing data sources; and

(ii) if feasible, developing online and real-time reporting systems;

(C) identify and report community-level economic and environmental impacts, including with respect to

(i) the reliability and security of the energy supply; and

(ii) local areas with households with a high energy burden; and

(D) improve the presentation of data, including by

(i) enabling the presentation of data in an interactive cartographic format on a national, regional, State, and local level with the functionality of viewing various economic, energy, and demographic measures on an individual basis or in combination; and

(ii) incorporating the results of the data collection, methods, and tools described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) into existing and new digital distribution methods.

(2) Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey

With respect to the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, the Administrator shall

(A) implement measures to provide more detailed representations of data by region;

(B) for large manufacturing facilities, break out process heat use by required process temperatures in order to facilitate the identification of opportunities for cost reductions and energy efficiency or energy productivity improvements;

(C) collect information on

(i) energy source-switching capabilities, especially with respect to thermal processes and the efficiency of thermal processes;

(ii) the use of electricity, biofuels, hydrogen, or other alternative fuels to produce process heat; and

(iii) the use of demand response; and

(D) identify current and potential future industrial clusters in which multiple firms and facilities in a defined geographic area share the costs and benefits of infrastructure for clean manufacturing, such as

(i) hydrogen generation, production, transport, use, and storage infrastructure; and

(ii) carbon dioxide capture, transport, use, and storage infrastructure.

(3) Residential Energy Consumption Survey

With respect to the Residential Energy Consumption Survey, the Administrator shall

(A) implement measures to provide more detailed representations of data by

(i) geographic area, including by State (for each State);

(ii) building type, including multi-family buildings;

(iii) household income;

(iv) location in a rural area; and

(v) other demographic characteristics, as determined by the Administrator; and

(B) report measures of

(i) household electrical service capacity;

(ii) access to utility demand-side management programs and bill credits;

(iii) characteristics of the energy mix used to generate electricity in different regions; and

(iv) the household energy burden for households

(I) in different geographic areas;

(II) by electricity, heating, and other end-uses; and

(III) with different demographic characteristics that correlate with increased household energy burden, including

(aa) having a low household income;

(bb) being a minority household;

(cc) residing in manufactured or multifamily housing;

(dd) being in a fixed or retirement income household;

(ee) residing in rental housing; and

(ff) other factors, as determined by the Administrator.
