#### § 1320a–7. Exclusion of certain individuals and entities from participation in Medicare and State health care programs
##### (c) Notice, effective date, and period of exclusion
######## (B) Unless the Secretary determines that the health and safety of individuals receiving services warrants the exclusion taking effect earlier, an exclusion shall not apply to payments made under subchapter XVIII or under a State health care program for

(i) inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who was admitted to such institution before the date of the exclusion, or

(ii) home health services and hospice care furnished to an individual under a plan of care established before the date of the exclusion, until the passage of 30 days after the effective date of the exclusion.

(3)

(A) The Secretary shall specify, in the notice of exclusion under paragraph (1) and the written notice under section 1320a–7a of this title , the minimum period (or, in the case of an exclusion of an individual under subsection (b)(12) or in the case described in subparagraph (G), the period) of the exclusion.

(B) Subject to subparagraph (G), in the case of an exclusion under subsection (a), the minimum period of exclusion shall be not less than five years, except that, upon the request of the administrator of a Federal health care program (as defined in section 1320a–7b(f) of this title ) who determines that the exclusion would impose a hardship on beneficiaries (as defined in section 1320a–7a(i)(5) of this title ) of that program, the Secretary may, after consulting with the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, waive the exclusion under subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(4) with respect to that program in the case of an individual or entity that is the sole community physician or sole source of essential specialized services in a community. The Secretary’s decision whether to waive the exclusion shall not be reviewable.
