#### § 7541. Compliance by vehicles and engines in actual use
##### (i) Warranty period

(1) In general

For purposes of subsection (a)(1) and subsection (b) of this section, the warranty period, effective with respect to new light-duty trucks and new light-duty vehicles and engines, manufactured in the model year 1995 and thereafter, shall be the first 2 years or 24,000 miles of use (whichever first occurs), except as provided in paragraph (2). For purposes of subsection (a)(1) and subsection (b), for other vehicles and engines the warranty period shall be the period established by the Administrator by regulation (promulgated prior to November 15, 1990 ) for such purposes unless the Administrator subsequently modifies such regulation.

(2) Specified major emission control components

In the case of a specified major emission control component, the warranty period for new light-duty trucks and new light-duty vehicles and engines manufactured in the model year 1995 and thereafter for purposes of subsection (a)(1) and subsection (b) shall be 8 years or 80,000 miles of use (whichever first occurs). As used in this paragraph, the term “specified major emission control component” means only a catalytic converter, an electronic emissions control unit, and an onboard emissions diagnostic device, except that the Administrator may designate any other pollution control device or component as a specified major emission control component if

(A) the device or component was not in general use on vehicles and engines manufactured prior to the model year 1990; and

(B) the Administrator determines that the retail cost (exclusive of installation costs) of such device or component exceeds $200 (in 1989 dollars), adjusted for inflation or deflation as calculated by the Administrator at the time of such determination. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “onboard emissions diagnostic device” means any device installed for the purpose of storing or processing emissions related diagnostic information, but not including any parts or other systems which it monitors except specified major emissions control components. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to provide that any part (other than a part referred to in the preceding sentence) shall be required to be warranted under this chapter for the period of 8 years or 80,000 miles referred to in this paragraph.

(3) Instructions

Subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(2) shall apply only where the Administrator has made a determination that the instructions concerned conform to the requirements of subsection (c)(3).
