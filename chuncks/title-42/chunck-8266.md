The State may rely on a finding from an Express Lane agency notwithstanding sections 1396a(a)(46)(B) and 1320b–7(d) of this title or any differences in budget unit, disregard, deeming or other methodology, if the following requirements are met:

(I) Prohibition on determining children ineligible for coverage .

If a finding from an Express Lane agency would result in a determination that a child does not satisfy an eligibility requirement for medical assistance under this subchapter and for child health assistance under subchapter XXI, the State shall determine eligibility for assistance using its regular procedures.

(II) Notice requirement .

For any child who is found eligible for medical assistance under the State plan under this subchapter or child health assistance under subchapter XXI and who is subject to premiums based on an Express Lane agency’s finding of such child’s income level, the State shall provide notice that the child may qualify for lower premium payments if evaluated by the State using its regular policies and of the procedures for requesting such an evaluation.

(III) Compliance with screen and enroll requirement .

The State shall satisfy the requirements under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1397bb(b)(3) of this title (relating to screen and enroll) before enrolling a child in child health assistance under subchapter XXI.

(ii) to modify the limitations in section 1396a(a)(5) of this title concerning the agencies that may make a determination of eligibility for medical assistance under this subchapter.

(C) Options for satisfying the screen and enroll requirement.

(i) In general .

With respect to a child whose eligibility for medical assistance under this subchapter or for child health assistance under subchapter XXI has been evaluated by a State agency using an income finding from an Express Lane agency, a State may carry out its duties under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1397bb(b)(3) of this title (relating to screen and enroll) in accordance with either clause (ii) or clause (iii).

(ii) Establishing a screening threshold.

(I) In general .

Under this clause, the State establishes a screening threshold set as a percentage of the Federal poverty level that exceeds the highest income threshold applicable under this subchapter to the child by a minimum of 30 percentage points or, at State option, a higher number of percentage points that reflects the value (as determined by the State and described in the State plan) of any differences between income methodologies used by the program administered by the Express Lane agency and the methodologies used by the State in determining eligibility for medical assistance under this subchapter.

(II) Children with income not above threshold .

If the income of a child does not exceed the screening threshold, the child is deemed to satisfy the income eligibility criteria for medical assistance under this subchapter regardless of whether such child would otherwise satisfy such criteria.

(III) Children with income above threshold .

If the income of a child exceeds the screening threshold, the child shall be considered to have an income above the Medicaid applicable income level described in section 1397jj(b)(4) of this title and to satisfy the requirement under section 1397jj(b)(1)(C) of this title (relating to the requirement that CHIP matching funds be used only for children not eligible for Medicaid).

During such temporary enrollment period, the State shall determine the child’s eligibility for child health assistance under subchapter XXI or for medical assistance under this subchapter in accordance with this clause.

(III) Prompt follow up .

In making such a determination, the State shall take prompt action to determine whether the child should be enrolled in medical assistance under this subchapter or child health assistance under subchapter XXI pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1397bb(b)(3) of this title (relating to screen and enroll).

(IV) Requirement for simplified determination .

In making such a determination, the State shall use procedures that, to the maximum feasible extent, reduce the burden imposed on the individual of such determination. Such procedures may not require the child’s parent, guardian, or custodial relative to provide or verify information that already has been provided to the State agency by an Express Lane agency or another source of information unless the State agency has reason to believe the information is erroneous.

(V) Availability of chip matching funds during temporary enrollment period .

Medical assistance for items and services that are provided to a child enrolled in subchapter XXI during a temporary enrollment period under this clause shall be treated as child health assistance under such subchapter.

(ii) Information requirement .

The requirement of this clause is that the State informs the parent, guardian, or custodial relative of the child of the services that will be covered, appropriate methods for using such services, premium or other cost sharing charges (if any) that apply, medical support obligations (under section 1396k(a) of this title ) created by enrollment (if applicable), and the actions the parent, guardian, or relative must take to maintain enrollment and renew coverage.
