(B) Exception

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any State that, on February 4, 2009 , has an approved State plan amendment or waiver to provide, or has enacted a State law to submit a State plan amendment to provide, expenditures described in such subparagraph under the State child health plan.

(i) In general

In this paragraph, the term “premium assistance subsidy” means, with respect to a targeted low-income child, the amount equal to the difference between the employee contribution required for enrollment only of the employee under qualified employer-sponsored coverage and the employee contribution required for enrollment of the employee and the child in such coverage, less any applicable premium cost-sharing applied under the State child health plan (subject to the limitations imposed under section 1397cc(e) of this title , including the requirement to count the total amount of the employee contribution required for enrollment of the employee and the child in such coverage toward the annual aggregate cost-sharing limit applied under paragraph (3)(B) of such section).

(II) cost-sharing protection consistent with section 1397cc(e) of this title .

(ii) Record keeping requirements

For purposes of carrying out clause (i), a State may elect to directly pay out-of-pocket expenditures for cost-sharing imposed under the qualified employer-sponsored coverage and collect or not collect all or any portion of such expenditures from the parent of the child.

(F) Application of waiting period imposed under the State

Any waiting period imposed under the State child health plan prior to the provision of child health assistance to a targeted low-income child under the State plan shall apply to the same extent to the provision of a premium assistance subsidy for the child under this paragraph.

(G) Opt-out permitted for any month

A State shall establish a process for permitting the parent of a targeted low-income child receiving a premium assistance subsidy to disenroll the child from the qualified employer-sponsored coverage and enroll the child in, and receive child health assistance under, the State child health plan, effective on the first day of any month for which the child is eligible for such assistance and in a manner that ensures continuity of coverage for the child.

(H) Application to parents

If a State provides child health assistance or health benefits coverage to parents of a targeted low-income child in accordance with section 1397kk(b) of this title , the State may elect to offer a premium assistance subsidy to a parent of a targeted low-income child who is eligible for such a subsidy under this paragraph in the same manner as the State offers such a subsidy for the enrollment of the child in qualified employer-sponsored coverage, except that

(i) the amount of the premium assistance subsidy shall be increased to take into account the cost of the enrollment of the parent in the qualified employer-sponsored coverage or, at the option of the State if the State determines it cost-effective, the cost of the enrollment of the child’s family in such coverage; and

(M) Coordination with medicaid

In the case of a targeted low-income child who receives child health assistance through a State plan under subchapter XIX and who voluntarily elects to receive a premium assistance subsidy under this section, the provisions of section 1396e–1 of this title shall apply and shall supersede any other provisions of this paragraph that are inconsistent with such section.
