##### (f) Quality standards

(1) In general

The standards referred to in subsection (d)(1)(B)(i) are standards established by the Secretary which include

(A) standards that require establishment and maintenance of a quality assurance and quality control program at each facility that is adequate and appropriate to ensure the reliability, clarity, and accuracy of interpretation of mammograms and standards for appropriate radiation dose;

(B) standards that require use of radiological equipment specifically designed for mammography, including radiologic standards and standards for other equipment and materials used in conjunction with such equipment;

(C) a requirement that personnel who perform mammography

(i)

(I) be licensed by a State to perform radiological procedures; or

(II) be certified as qualified to perform radiological procedures by an organization described in paragraph (2)(A); and

(ii) during the 2-year period beginning October 1, 1994 , meet training standards for personnel who perform mammography or meet experience requirements which shall at a minimum include 1 year of experience in the performance of mammography; and

(iii) upon the expiration of such 2-year period meet minimum training standards for personnel who perform mammograms;

(D) a requirement that mammograms be interpreted by a physician who is certified as qualified to interpret radiological procedures, including mammography

(i)

(I) by a board described in paragraph (2)(B); or

(II) by a program that complies with the standards described in paragraph (2)(C); and

(ii) who meets training and continuing medical education requirements as established by the Secretary;

(E) a requirement that individuals who survey mammography facilities be medical physicists

(i) licensed or approved by a State to perform such surveys, reviews, or inspections for mammography facilities;

(ii) certified in diagnostic radiological physics or certified as qualified to perform such surveys by a board as described in paragraph (2)(D); or

(iii) in the first 5 years after October 27, 1992 , who meet other criteria established by the Secretary which are comparable to the criteria described in clause (i) or (ii);

(F) a requirement that a medical physicist who is qualified in mammography as described in subparagraph (E) survey mammography equipment and oversee quality assurance practices at each facility;

(G) a requirement that

(i) a facility that performs any mammogram

(I) except as provided in subclause (II), maintain the mammogram in the permanent medical records of the patient for a period of not less than 5 years, or not less than 10 years if no subsequent mammograms of such patient are performed at the facility, or longer if mandated by State law; and

(IV) whether or not such a physician is available or there is no such physician, a summary of the written report shall be sent directly to the patient in terms easily understood by a lay person; and

(H) standards relating to special techniques for mammography of patients with breast implants. Subparagraph (G) shall not be construed to limit a patient’s access to the patient’s medical records.

(2) Certification of personnel

The Secretary shall by regulation

(A) specify organizations eligible to certify individuals to perform radiological procedures as required by paragraph (1)(C);

(B) specify boards eligible to certify physicians to interpret radiological procedures, including mammography, as required by paragraph (1)(D);

(C) establish standards for a program to certify physicians described in paragraph (1)(D); and

(D) specify boards eligible to certify medical physicists who are qualified to survey mammography equipment and to oversee quality assurance practices at mammography facilities.
