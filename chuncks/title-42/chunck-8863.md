(2) Shortfall States described

For purposes of paragraph (1), a shortfall State described in this paragraph is a State with a State child health plan approved under this subchapter for which the Secretary estimates, on the basis of the most recent data available to the Secretary as of December 16, 2005 , that the projected expenditures under such plan for such State for fiscal year 2006 will exceed the sum of

(A) the amount of the State’s allotments for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 that will not be expended by the end of fiscal year 2005;

(B) the amount, if any, that is to be redistributed to the State during fiscal year 2006 in accordance with subsection (f); and

(C) the amount of the State’s allotment for fiscal year 2006.

(3) Allotments

In addition to the allotments provided under subsections (b) and (c), subject to paragraph (4), of the amount available for the additional allotments under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2006, the Secretary shall allot

(A) to each shortfall State described in paragraph (2) such amount as the Secretary determines will eliminate the estimated shortfall described in such paragraph for the State; and

(B) to each commonwealth or territory described in subsection (c)(3), the same proportion as the proportion of the commonwealth’s or territory’s allotment under subsection (c) (determined without regard to subsection (f)) to 1.05 percent of the amount appropriated under paragraph (1).

(4) Use of additional allotment

Additional allotments provided under this subsection are only available for amounts expended under a State plan approved under this subchapter for child health assistance for targeted low-income children.

(5) 1-year availability; no redistribution of unexpended additional allotments

Notwithstanding subsections (e) and (f), amounts allotted to a State pursuant to this subsection for fiscal year 2006 shall only remain available for expenditure by the State through September 30, 2006 . Any amounts of such allotments that remain unexpended as of such date shall not be subject to redistribution under subsection (f) and shall revert to the Treasury on October 1, 2006 .
