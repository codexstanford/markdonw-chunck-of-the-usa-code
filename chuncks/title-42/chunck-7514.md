#### § 1395w–23. Payments to Medicare+Choice organizations
##### (c) Calculation of annual Medicare+Choice capitation rates

(1) In general

For purposes of this part, subject to paragraphs (6)(C) and (7), each annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate, for a Medicare+Choice payment area that is an MA local area for a contract year consisting of a calendar year, is equal to the largest of the amounts specified in the following subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D):

(A) Blended capitation rate

For a year before 2005, the sum of

(i) the area-specific percentage (as specified under paragraph (2) for the year) of the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the Medicare+Choice payment area, as determined under paragraph (3) for the year, and

(ii) the national percentage (as specified under paragraph (2) for the year) of the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate, as determined under paragraph (4) for the year, multiplied (for a year other than 2004) by the budget neutrality adjustment factor determined under paragraph (5).

(B) Minimum amount

12 multiplied by the following amount:

(i) For 1998, $367 (but not to exceed, in the case of an area outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 150 percent of the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area).

(ii) For 1999 and 2000, the minimum amount determined under clause (i) or this clause, respectively, for the preceding year, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage described in paragraph (6)(A) applicable to 1999 or 2000, respectively.

(iii)

(I) Subject to subclause (II), for 2001, for any area in a Metropolitan Statistical Area with a population of more than 250,000, $525, and for any other area $475.

(II) In the case of an area outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, the amount specified in this clause shall not exceed 120 percent of the amount determined under clause (ii) for such area for 2000.

(iv) For 2002, 2003, and 2004, the minimum amount specified in this clause (or clause (iii)) for the preceding year increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage, described in paragraph (6)(A) for that succeeding year.

(C) Minimum percentage increase

(i) For 1998, 102 percent of the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the Medicare+Choice payment area.

(ii) For 1999 and 2000, 102 percent of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for the previous year.

(iii) For 2001, 103 percent of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for 2000.

(iv) For 2002 and 2003, 102 percent of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for the previous year.

(v) For 2004 and each succeeding year, the greater of

(I) 102 percent of the annual MA capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for the previous year; or

(II) the annual MA capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for the previous year increased by the national per capita MA growth percentage, described in paragraph (6) for that succeeding year, but not taking into account any adjustment under paragraph (6)(C) for a year before 2004.

(D) 100 percent of fee-for-service costs

(i) In general

For each year specified in clause (ii), the adjusted average per capita cost for the year involved, determined under section 1395mm(a)(4) of this title and adjusted as appropriate for the purpose of risk adjustment, for the MA payment area for individuals who are not enrolled in an MA plan under this part for the year, but adjusted to exclude costs attributable to payments under sections, 3 1395w–4( o ), and  3 1395ww(n) and 1395ww(h) of this title.

(ii) Periodic rebasing

The provisions of clause (i) shall apply for 2004 and for subsequent years as the Secretary shall specify (but not less than once every 3 years).

(iii) Inclusion of costs of VA and DOD military facility services to medicare-eligible beneficiaries

In determining the adjusted average per capita cost under clause (i) for a year, such cost shall be adjusted to include the Secretary’s estimate, on a per capita basis, of the amount of additional payments that would have been made in the area involved under this subchapter if individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter had not received services from facilities of the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs.

(2) Area-specific and national percentages

For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)

(A) for 1998, the “area-specific percentage” is 90 percent and the “national percentage” is 10 percent,

(B) for 1999, the “area-specific percentage” is 82 percent and the “national percentage” is 18 percent,

(C) for 2000, the “area-specific percentage” is 74 percent and the “national percentage” is 26 percent,

(D) for 2001, the “area-specific percentage” is 66 percent and the “national percentage” is 34 percent,

(E) for 2002, the “area-specific percentage” is 58 percent and the “national percentage” is 42 percent, and

(F) for a year after 2002, the “area-specific percentage” is 50 percent and the “national percentage” is 50 percent.

(3) Annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), subject to subparagraphs (B) and (E), the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area

(i) for 1998 is, subject to subparagraph (D), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for 1998 (described in paragraph (6)(A)); or

(ii) for a subsequent year is the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the previous year determined under this paragraph for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for such subsequent year.

(B) Removal of medical education from calculation of adjusted average per capita cost

(i) In general

In determining the area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with 1998), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be adjusted to exclude from the rate the applicable percent (specified in clause (ii)) of the payment adjustments described in subparagraph (C).

(ii) Applicable percent

For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percent for

(I) 1998 is 20 percent,

(II) 1999 is 40 percent,

(III) 2000 is 60 percent,

(IV) 2001 is 80 percent, and

(V) a succeeding year is 100 percent.

(C) Payment adjustment

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the payment adjustments described in this subparagraph are payment adjustments which the Secretary estimates were payable during 1997

(I) for the indirect costs of medical education under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title , and

(II) for direct graduate medical education costs under section 1395ww(h) of this title .

(ii) Treatment of payments covered under State hospital reimbursement system

To the extent that the Secretary estimates that an annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 described in clause (i) reflects payments to hospitals reimbursed under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title , the Secretary shall estimate a payment adjustment that is comparable to the payment adjustment that would have been made under clause (i) if the hospitals had not been reimbursed under such section.

(D) Treatment of areas with highly variable payment rates

In the case of a Medicare+Choice payment area for which the annual per capita rate of payment determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for 1997 varies by more than 20 percent from such rate for 1996, for purposes of this subsection the Secretary may substitute for such rate for 1997 a rate that is more representative of the costs of the enrollees in the area.

(E) Inclusion of costs of DOD and VA military facility services to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries

In determining the area-specific MA capitation rate under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with 2004), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be adjusted to include in the rate the Secretary’s estimate, on a per capita basis, of the amount of additional payments that would have been made in the area involved under this subchapter if individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter had not received services from facilities of the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs.

(4) Input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a year is equal to the sum, for all the types of medicare services (as classified by the Secretary), of the product (for each such type of service) of

(i) the national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate (determined under subparagraph (B)) for the year,

(ii) the proportion of such rate for the year which is attributable to such type of services, and

(iii) an index that reflects (for that year and that type of services) the relative input price of such services in the area compared to the national average input price of such services. In applying clause (iii), the Secretary may, subject to subparagraph (C), apply those indices under this subchapter that are used in applying (or updating) national payment rates for specific areas and localities.

(B) National standardized annual Medicare+ÐChoice capitation rate

In subparagraph (A)(i), the “national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate” for a year is equal to

(i) the sum (for all Medicare+Choice payment areas) of the product of

(I) the annual area-specific Medicare+ÐChoice capitation rate for that year for the area under paragraph (3), and

(II) the average number of medicare beneficiaries residing in that area in the year, multiplied by the average of the risk factor weights used to adjust payments under subsection (a)(1)(A) for such beneficiaries in such area; divided by

(ii) the sum of the products described in clause (i)(II) for all areas for that year.

(C) Special rules for 1998

In applying this paragraph for 1998

(i) medicare services shall be divided into 2 types of services: part A services and part B services;

(ii) the proportions described in subparagraph (A)(ii)

(I) for part A services shall be the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the national average annual per capita rate of payment for part A for 1997 to the total national average annual per capita rate of payment for parts A and B for 1997, and

(II) for part B services shall be 100 percent minus the ratio described in subclause (I);

(iii) for part A services, 70 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index used under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title to adjust payment rates for relative hospital wage levels for hospitals located in the payment area involved;

(iv) for part B services

(I) 66 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index of the geographic area factors under section 1395w–4(e) of this title used to adjust payment rates for physicians’ services furnished in the payment area, and

(II) of the remaining 34 percent of the amount of such payments, 40 percent shall be adjusted by the index described in clause (iii); and

(v) the index values shall be computed based only on the beneficiary population who are 65 years of age or older and who are not determined to have end stage renal disease. The Secretary may continue to apply the rules described in this subparagraph (or similar rules) for 1999.

(5) Payment adjustment budget neutrality factor

For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), for each year (other than 2004), the Secretary shall determine a budget neutrality adjustment factor so that the aggregate of the payments under this part (other than those attributable to subsections (a)(3)(C)(iv), (a)(4), and (i)) shall equal the aggregate payments that would have been made under this part if payment were based entirely on area-specific capitation rates.

(6) “National per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage” defined

(A) In general

In this part, the “national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage” for a year is the percentage determined by the Secretary, by March 1st before the beginning of the year involved, to reflect the Secretary’s estimate of the projected per capita rate of growth in expenditures under this subchapter for an individual entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B, excluding expenditures attributable to subsections (a)(7) and ( o ) of section 1395w–4 of this title and subsections (b)(3)(B)(ix) and (n) of section 1395ww of this title , reduced by the number of percentage points specified in subparagraph (B) for the year. Separate determinations may be made for aged enrollees, disabled enrollees, and enrollees with end-stage renal disease.

(B) Adjustment

The number of percentage points specified in this subparagraph is

(i) for 1998, 0.8 percentage points,

(ii) for 1999, 0.5 percentage points,

(iii) for 2000, 0.5 percentage points,

(iv) for 2001, 0.5 percentage points,

(v) for 2002, 0.3 percentage points, and

(vi) for a year after 2002, 0 percentage points.

(C) Adjustment for over or under projection of national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage

Beginning with rates calculated for 1999, before computing rates for a year as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adjust all area-specific and national Medicare+Choice capitation rates (and beginning in 2000, the minimum amount) for the previous year for the differences between the projections of the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for that year and previous years and the current estimate of such percentage for such years, except that for purposes of paragraph (1)(C)(v)(II), no such adjustment shall be made for a year before 2004.

(7) Adjustment for national coverage determinations and legislative changes in benefits

If the Secretary makes a determination with respect to coverage under this subchapter or there is a change in benefits required to be provided under this part that the Secretary projects will result in a significant increase in the costs to Medicare+Choice of providing benefits under contracts under this part (for periods after any period described in section 1395w–22(a)(5) of this title ), the Secretary shall adjust appropriately the payments to such organizations under this part. Such projection and adjustment shall be based on an analysis by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the actuarial costs associated with the new benefits.
