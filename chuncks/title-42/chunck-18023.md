### CHAPTER 105— COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAMS
#### § 9812. Development loan fund
##### (a) Authorities, scope, and purposes; conditions; interest rate; repayment

The Secretary is authorized to make or guarantee loans (either directly or in cooperation with banks or other organizations through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred basis) to community development corporations, to families and local cooperatives and the designated supportive organizations of cooperatives eligible for financial assistance under this subchapter, to private nonprofit organizations receiving assistance under chapter 106 of this title, or to public and private nonprofit organizations or agencies, for business facilities and community development projects, including community development credit unions, which the Secretary determines will carry out the purposes of this part. No loans, guarantees, or other financial assistance shall be provided under this section unless the Secretary determines that

(1) there is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan;

(2) the loan is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from private sources or other Federal, State, or local programs; and

(3) the amount of the loan, together with other funds available, is adequate to assure completion of the project or achievement of the purposes for which the loan is made. Loans made by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding Treasury obligations of comparable maturity, plus such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be consistent with its purposes, except that, for the 5 years following the date in which funds are initially available to the borrower, the rate of interest shall be set at a rate considered appropriate by the Secretary in light of the particular needs of the borrower, which rate shall not be lower than 1 percent. All such loans shall be repayable within a period of not more than 30 years.
