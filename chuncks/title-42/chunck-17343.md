### CHAPTER 93— EMERGENCY ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 8511. National and State emergency conservation targets
##### (a) Determination and publication of targets

(1) Whenever the President finds, with respect to any energy source for which the President determines a severe energy supply interruption exists or is imminent or that actions to restrain domestic energy demand are required in order to fulfill the obligations of the United States under the international energy program, the President, in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, may establish monthly emergency conservation targets for any such energy source for the Nation generally and for each State.

(2) Any finding of the President under paragraph (1) shall be promptly transmitted to the Congress, accompanied by such information and analysis as is necessary to provide the basis for such finding, and shall be disseminated to the public.

(3)

(A) The State conservation target for any energy source shall be equal to (i) the State base period consumption reduced by (ii) a uniform national percentage.

(B) For the purposes of this subsection, the term “State base period consumption” means, for any month, the product of the following factors, as determined by the President:

(i) the consumption of the energy source for which a target is established during the corresponding month in the 12-month period prior to the first month for which the target is established; and

(ii) a growth adjustment factor, which shall be determined on the basis of the trends in the use in that State of such energy source during the 36-month period prior to the first month for which the target is established.

(C)

(i) The President shall adjust, to the extent he determines necessary, any State base period consumption to insure that achievement of a target established for that State under this subsection will not impair the attainment of the objectives of section 753(b)(1)  1 of title 15.
