#### § 13369. Establishment of data base and study of transportation rates
##### (a) Data base

The Secretary shall review the information currently collected by the Federal Government and shall determine whether information on transportation rates for rail and pipeline transport of domestic coal, oil, and gas during the period of January 1, 1988 , through December 31, 1997 , is reasonably available. If he determines that such information is not reasonably available, the Secretary shall establish a data base containing, to the maximum extent practicable, information on all such rates. The confidentiality of contract rates shall be preserved. To obtain data pertaining to rail contract rates, the Secretary shall acquire such data in aggregate form only from the Surface Transportation Board, under terms and conditions that maintain the confidentiality of such rates.
