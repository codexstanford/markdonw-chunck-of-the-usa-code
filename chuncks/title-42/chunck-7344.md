#### § 1395r. Amount of premiums for individuals enrolled under this part
##### (b) Increase in monthly premium

In the case of an individual whose coverage period began pursuant to an enrollment after his initial enrollment period (determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of section 1395p of this title ) and not pursuant to a special enrollment period under subsection (i)(4), ( l ), or (m) of section 1395p of this title , the monthly premium determined under subsection (a) (without regard to any adjustment under subsection (i)) shall be increased by 10 percent of the monthly premium so determined for each full 12 months (in the same continuous period of eligibility) in which he could have been but was not enrolled. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall be taken into account (1) the months which elapsed between the close of his initial enrollment period and the close of the enrollment period in which he enrolled, plus (in the case of an individual who reenrolls) (2) the months which elapsed between the date of termination of a previous coverage period and the close of the enrollment period in which he reenrolled, but there shall not be taken into account months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a group health plan described in section 1395y(b)(1)(A)(v) of this title by reason of the individual’s (or the individual’s spouse’s) current employment status or months during which the individual has not attained the age of 65 and for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a large group health plan (as that term is defined in section 1395y(b)(1)(B)(iii) of this title ) by reason of the individual’s current employment status (or the current employment status of a family member of the individual) or months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was an individual described in section 1395p(k)(3) of this title . Any increase in an individual’s monthly premium under the first sentence of this subsection with respect to a particular continuous period of eligibility shall not be applicable with respect to any other continuous period of eligibility which such individual may have. No increase in the premium shall be effected for a month in the case of an individual who enrolls under this part during 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004 and who demonstrates to the Secretary before December 31, 2004 , that the individual is a covered beneficiary (as defined in section 1072(5) of title 10 ). The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consult with the Secretary of Defense in identifying individuals described in the previous sentence. For purposes of determining any increase under this subsection for individuals whose enrollment occurs on or after January 1, 2023 , the second sentence of this subsection shall be applied by substituting “close of the month” for “close of the enrollment period” each place it appears. No increase in the premium shall be effected for individuals who are enrolled pursuant to section 1395 o (b) of this title for coverage only of immunosuppressive drugs.
