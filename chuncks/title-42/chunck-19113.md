#### § 11384. Incentives for high-performing communities
##### (a) Designation as a high-performing community

(1) In general

The Secretary shall designate, on an annual basis, which collaborative applicants represent high-performing communities.

(2) Consideration

In determining whether to designate a collaborative applicant as a high-performing community under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall establish criteria to ensure that the requirements described under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B) of subsection (d) are measured by comparing homeless individuals and families under similar circumstances, in order to encourage projects in the geographic area to serve homeless individuals and families with more severe barriers to housing stability.

(3) 2-year phase in

In each of the first 2 years after the effective date under section 1503 of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009, the Secretary shall designate not more than 10 collaborative applicants as high-performing communities.

(4) Excess of qualified applicants

If, during the 2-year period described under paragraph (2), more than 10 collaborative applicants could qualify to be designated as high-performing communities, the Secretary shall designate the 10 that have, in the discretion of the Secretary, the best performance based on the criteria described under subsection (d).

(5) Time limit on designation

The designation of any collaborative applicant as a high-performing community under this subsection shall be effective only for the year in which such designation is made. The Secretary, on an annual basis, may renew any such designation.
