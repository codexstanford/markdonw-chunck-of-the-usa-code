### CHAPTER 152— ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY
#### § 17071. Energy Code improvements applicable to manufactured housing
##### (b) Requirements

(1) International Energy Conservation Code

The energy conservation standards established under this section shall be based on the most recent version of the International Energy Conservation Code (including supplements), except in cases in which the Secretary finds that the code  1 is not cost-effective, or a more stringent standard would be more cost-effective, based on the impact of the code  1 on the purchase price of manufactured housing and on total life-cycle construction and operating costs.

(2) Considerations

The energy conservation standards established under this section may

(A) take into consideration the design and factory construction techniques of manufactured homes;

(B) be based on the climate zones established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development rather than the climate zones under the International Energy Conservation Code; and

(C) provide for alternative practices that result in net estimated energy consumption equal to or less than the specified standards.

(3) Updating

The energy conservation standards established under this section shall be updated not later than

(A) 1 year after December 19, 2007 ; and

(B) 1 year after any revision to the International Energy Conservation Code.
