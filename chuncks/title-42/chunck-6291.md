##### (a) Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays

If the day regularly designated for the delivery of benefit checks under subchapter II, VIII, or XVI falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday (as defined in section 6103 of title 5 ) in any month, the benefit checks which would otherwise be delivered on such day shall be mailed for delivery on the first day preceding such day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday (as so defined), without regard to whether the delivery of such checks would as a result have to be made before the end of the month for which such checks are issued.
