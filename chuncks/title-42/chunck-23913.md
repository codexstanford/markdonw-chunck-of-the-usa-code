#### § 19181. Agency responsibilities
##### (c) Strategic plan

(1) In general

Not later than one year after August 9, 2022 , the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in collaboration with the head of each Federal research agency, shall submit to Congress a report containing a strategic plan which reflects the plans of each Federal research agency to increase the capacity of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements and to encourage HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to participate in Federal programs.

(2) Considerations

In developing a strategic plan under paragraph (1), the Director and the head of each Federal research agency shall consider the following:

(A) Issuing new or expanding existing funding opportunities targeted to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.

(B) Modifying existing research and development program solicitations to incentivize effective partnerships with HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.

(C) Offering planning grants for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to develop or equip grant offices with the requisite depth of knowledge to submit competitive grant proposals and manage awarded grants.

(D) Offering additional training programs, including individualized and timely guidance to grant officers, faculty, and postdoctoral researchers at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to ensure their understanding of the requirements for an effective grant proposal.

(E) Other approaches for making current competitive funding models more accessible for underresourced HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.
