#### § 1396t. Home and community care for functionally disabled elderly individuals
##### (i) Survey and certification process

(1) Certifications

(A) Responsibilities of the State

Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of providers of home and community care and community care settings with the applicable requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h). The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.

(B) Responsibilities of the Secretary

The Secretary shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of State providers of home and community care, and of State community care settings in which such care is provided, with the requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h).

(C) Frequency of certifications

Certification of providers and settings under this subsection shall occur no less frequently than once every 12 months.

(2) Reviews of providers

(A) In general

The certification under this subsection with respect to a provider of home or community care must be based on a periodic review of the provider’s performance in providing the care required under ICCP’s in accordance with the requirements of subsection (f).

(B) Special reviews of compliance

Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a provider of home or community care with any of the requirements of subsection (f), the Secretary may conduct a review of the provider and, on the basis of that review, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the provider meets such requirements.

(3) Surveys of community care settings

(A) In general

The certification under this subsection with respect to community care settings must be based on a survey. Such survey for such a setting must be conducted without prior notice to the setting. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title . The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for scheduling and conducting such surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.

(B) Survey protocol

Surveys under this paragraph shall be conducted based upon a protocol which the Secretary has provided for under subsection (k).

(C) Prohibition of conflict of interest in survey team membership

A State and the Secretary may not use as a member of a survey team under this paragraph an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the community care setting being surveyed (or the person responsible for such setting) respecting compliance with the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the setting being surveyed.

(D) Validation surveys of community care settings

The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of community care settings in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under subparagraph (A) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under subparagraph (A). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under subparagraph (B). If the State has determined that an individual setting meets the requirements of subsection (g), but the Secretary determines that the setting does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the setting’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.

(E) Special surveys of compliance

Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the requirements of subsection (g) or (h), the Secretary may conduct a survey of the setting and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the setting meets such requirements.

(4) Investigation of complaints and monitoring of providers and settings

Each State and the Secretary shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to investigate complaints of violations of applicable requirements imposed on providers of community care or on community care settings under subsections (f), (g) and (h).

(5) Investigation of allegations of individual neglect and abuse and misappropriation of individual property

The State shall provide, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of providers of home or community care and community care settings under this subsection, for a process for the receipt, review, and investigation of allegations of individual neglect and abuse (including injuries of unknown source) by individuals providing such care or in such setting and of misappropriation of individual property by such individuals. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that an individual has neglected or abused an individual receiving community care or misappropriated such individual’s property, the State shall notify the individual against whom the finding is made. A State shall not make a finding that a person has neglected an individual receiving community care if the person demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the person. The State shall provide for public disclosure of findings under this paragraph upon request and for inclusion, in any such disclosure of such findings, of any brief statement (or of a clear and accurate summary thereof) of the individual disputing such findings.

(6) Disclosure of results of inspections and activities

(A) Public information

Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public

(i) information respecting all surveys, reviews, and certifications made under this subsection respecting providers of home or community care and community care settings, including statements of deficiencies,

(ii) copies of cost reports (if any) of such providers and settings filed under this subchapter,

(iii) copies of statements of ownership under section 1320a–3 of this title , and

(iv) information disclosed under section 1320a–5 of this title .

(B) Notices of substandard care

If a State finds that

(i) a provider of home or community care has provided care of substandard quality with respect to an individual, the State shall make a reasonable effort to notify promptly (I) an immediate family member of each such individual and (II) individuals receiving home or community care from that provider under this subchapter, or

(ii) a community care setting is substandard, the State shall make a reasonable effort to notify promptly (I) individuals receiving community care in that setting, and (II) immediate family members of such individuals.

(C) Access to fraud control units

Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under section 1396b(q) of this title ) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys, reviews, and certifications under this subsection.
