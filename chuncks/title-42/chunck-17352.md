### CHAPTER 93— EMERGENCY ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 8512. State emergency conservation plan
##### (c) Approval of State plans

(1) As soon as practicable after the date of the receipt of any State plan, but in no event later than 30 days after such date, the Secretary shall review such plan and shall approve it unless the Secretary finds

(A) that, taken as a whole, the plan is not likely to achieve the emergency conservation target established for that State under section 8511(a) of this title for each energy source involved,

(B) that, taken as a whole, the plan is likely to impose an unreasonably disproportionate share of the burden of restrictions of energy use on any specific class of industry, business, or commercial enterprise, or any individual segment thereof,

(C) that the requirements of this subchapter regarding the plan have not been met, or

(D) that a measure described in subsection (b)(1) is

(i) inconsistent with any otherwise applicable Federal law (including any rule or regulation under such law),

(ii) an undue burden on interstate commerce, or

(iii) a tax, tariff, or user fee not authorized by State law.

(2) Any measure contained in a State plan shall become effective in that State on the date the Secretary approves the plan under this subsection or such later date as may be prescribed in, or pursuant to, the plan.
