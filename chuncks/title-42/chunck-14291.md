#### § 6213. Certain lease bidding arrangements prohibited
##### (c) Exemptions

The Secretary may, in his discretion, consider a request from any person described in subsection (a) of this section for an exemption from the prohibition of this section. In considering any such request, the Secretary may exempt bidding for leases for lands in any area only if the Secretary finds, on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, that

(1) such lands have extremely high cost exploration or development problems; and

(2) exploration and development will not occur on such lands unless such exemption is granted. Findings of the Secretary under this subsection shall be final, and shall not be invalidated unless found to be arbitrary or capricious.
