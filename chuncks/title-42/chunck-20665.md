#### § 13435. Electric motor vehicles and associated equipment research and development
##### (c) Cooperative agreements

The Secretary, consistent with the comprehensive plan under subsection (b), may enter into cooperative agreements to conduct research and development projects with industry in such areas of technology development as

(1) high efficiency electric power trains, including advanced motors, motor controllers, and hybrid power trains for electric motor vehicle range improvement;

(2) light-weight structures for electric motor vehicle weight reduction;

(3) advanced batteries with high energy density and power density, and improved range or recharging cycles for a given unit weight, for electric motor vehicle application;

(4) hybrid power trains incorporating an electric motor and recyclable battery charged by an onboard liquid fuel engine, designed to significantly improve fuel economies while maintaining acceleration characteristics comparable to a conventionally fueled vehicle;

(5) batteries and fuel cells for electric-hybrid vehicle application;

(6) fuel cells and fuel cell systems for primary electric motor vehicle power sources; and

(7) photovoltaics for use with electric motor vehicles.
