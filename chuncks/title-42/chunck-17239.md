### CHAPTER 92— POWERPLANT AND INDUSTRIAL FUEL USE
#### § 8352. Permanent exemptions
##### (b) Permanent exemption due to certain State or local requirements

After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption from one or more of the prohibitions of part A for a powerplant, the Secretary may, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that

(1) with respect to the site of the powerplant, the operation of such a facility using coal or any other alternate fuel is infeasible because of a State or local requirement;

(2) if such State or local requirement is under a building code or nuisance or zoning law, no other exemption under this part could be granted for such facility; and

(3) the granting of the exemption would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
