### CHAPTER 92— POWERPLANT AND INDUSTRIAL FUEL USE
#### § 8322. Permanent exemptions
##### (b) Permanent exemption due to certain State or local requirements

After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption for a powerplant from the prohibitions of part A, the Secretary may, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection with respect to natural gas or petroleum, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that

(1) with respect to the proposed site of the powerplant, the construction or operation of such a facility using coal or any other alternate fuel is infeasible because of a State or local requirement (other than a building code or a nuisance or zoning law);

(2) there is no reasonable alternative site for such powerplant which meets the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(1)(A) through (D); and

(3) the granting of the exemption would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
