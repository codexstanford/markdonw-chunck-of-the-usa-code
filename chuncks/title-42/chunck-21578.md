#### § 16104. Reduction of engine idling
##### (b) Idle reduction technology benefits, programs, and studies

(1) In general

Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall

(A)

(i) commence a review of the mobile source air emission models of the Environmental Protection Agency used under the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) to determine whether the models accurately reflect the emissions resulting from long-duration idling of heavy-duty vehicles and other vehicles and engines; and

(ii) update those models as the Administrator determines to be appropriate; and

(B)

(i) commence a review of the emission reductions achieved by the use of idle reduction technology; and

(ii) complete such revisions of the regulations and guidance of the Environmental Protection Agency as the Administrator determines to be appropriate.

(2) Deadline for completion

Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall

(A) complete the reviews under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B)(i) of paragraph (1); and

(3) Discretionary inclusions

The reviews under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B)(i) of paragraph (1) and the reports under paragraph (2)(B) may address the potential fuel savings resulting from use of idle reduction technology.

(4) Idle reduction and energy conservation deployment program

(A) Establishment

(i) In general

Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation shall, through the Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, establish a program to support deployment of idle reduction and energy conservation technologies.

(ii) Priority

The Administrator shall give priority to the deployment of idle reduction and energy conservation technologies based on the costs and beneficial effects on air quality and ability to lessen the emission of criteria air pollutants.

(B) Funding

(i) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator to carry out subparagraph (A) for the purpose of reducing extended idling from heavy-duty vehicles $19,500,000 for fiscal year 2006, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $45,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.

(ii) Locomotives

There are authorized to be appropriated to the administrator to carry out subparagraph (A) for the purpose of reducing extended idling from locomotives $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.

(iii) Cost sharing

Subject to clause (iv), the Administrator shall require at least 50 percent of the costs directly and specifically related to any project under this section to be provided from non-Federal sources.

(iv) Necessary and appropriate reductions

The Administrator may reduce the non-Federal requirement under clause (iii) if the Administrator determines that the reduction is necessary and appropriate to meet the objectives of this section.

(5) Idling location study

(A) In general

Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall commence a study to analyze all locations at which heavy-duty vehicles stop for long-duration idling, including

(i) truck stops;

(ii) rest areas;

(iii) border crossings;

(iv) ports;

(v) transfer facilities; and

(vi) private terminals.

(B) Deadline for completion

Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005 , the Administrator shall

(i) complete the study under subparagraph (A); and

(ii) prepare and make publicly available one or more reports of the results of the study.
