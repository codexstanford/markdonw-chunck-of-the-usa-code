(1) A State may provide, as medical assistance, case management services under the plan without regard to the requirements of section 1396a(a)(1) of this title and section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title . The provision of case management services under this subsection shall not restrict the choice of the individual to receive medical assistance in violation of section 1396a(a)(23) of this title . A State may limit the provision of case management services under this subsection to individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or with AIDS-related conditions, or with either, or to individuals described in section 1396a(z)(1)(A) of this title and a State may limit the provision of case management services under this subsection to individuals with chronic mental illness. The State may limit the case managers available with respect to case management services for eligible individuals with developmental disabilities or with chronic mental illness in order to ensure that the case managers for such individuals are capable of ensuring that such individuals receive needed services.

(2) For purposes of this subsection:

(III) Referral and related activities to help an individual obtain needed services, including activities that help link eligible individuals with medical, social, educational providers or other programs and services that are capable of providing needed services, such as making referrals to providers for needed services and scheduling appointments for the individual.

(IV) Monitoring and followup activities, including activities and contacts that are necessary to ensure the care plan is effectively implemented and adequately addressing the needs of the eligible individual, and which may be with the individual, family members, providers, or other entities and conducted as frequently as necessary to help determine such matters as

(aa) whether services are being furnished in accordance with an individual’s care plan;

(bb) whether the services in the care plan are adequate; and

(cc) whether there are changes in the needs or status of the eligible individual, and if so, making necessary adjustments in the care plan and service arrangements with providers.

(iii) Such term does not include the direct delivery of an underlying medical, educational, social, or other service to which an eligible individual has been referred, including, with respect to the direct delivery of foster care services, services such as (but not limited to) the following:

(3) With respect to contacts with individuals who are not eligible for medical assistance under the State plan or, in the case of targeted case management services, individuals who are eligible for such assistance but are not part of the target population specified in the State plan, such contacts

(A) are considered an allowable case management activity, when the purpose of the contact is directly related to the management of the eligible individual’s care; and

(B) are not considered an allowable case management activity if such contacts relate directly to the identification and management of the noneligible or nontargeted individual’s needs and care.

(4)

(A) In accordance with section 1396a(a)(25) of this title , Federal financial participation only is available under this subchapter for case management services or targeted case management services if there are no other third parties liable to pay for such services, including as reimbursement under a medical, social, educational, or other program.

(B) A State shall allocate the costs of any part of such services which are reimbursable under another federally funded program in accordance with OMB Circular A–87 (or any related or successor guidance or regulations regarding allocation of costs among federally funded programs) under an approved cost allocation program.

(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting the application of rules with respect to third party liability under programs, or activities carried out under title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 300ff et seq.] or by the Indian Health Service.
