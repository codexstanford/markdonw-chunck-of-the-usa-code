### CHAPTER 85— AIR POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 7661c. Permit requirements and conditions
##### (b) Monitoring and analysis

The Administrator may by rule prescribe procedures and methods for determining compliance and for monitoring and analysis of pollutants regulated under this chapter, but continuous emissions monitoring need not be required if alternative methods are available that provide sufficiently reliable and timely information for determining compliance. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any continuous emissions monitoring requirement of subchapter IV–A, or where required elsewhere in this chapter.
