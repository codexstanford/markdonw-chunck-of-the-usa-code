#### § 6947. Approval of State plan; Federal assistance
##### (a) Plan approval

The Administrator shall, within six months after a State plan has been submitted for approval, approve or disapprove the plan. The Administrator shall approve a plan if he determines that

(1) it meets the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (5) of section 6943(a) of this title ; and

(2) it contains provision for revision of such plan, after notice and public hearing, whenever the Administrator, by regulation, determines

(A) that revised regulations respecting minimum requirements have been promulgated under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (5) of section 6943(a) of this title with which the State plan is not in compliance;

(B) that information has become available which demonstrates the inadequacy of the plan to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter; or

(C) that such revision is otherwise necessary. The Administrator shall review approved plans from time to time and if he determines that revision or corrections are necessary to bring such plan into compliance with the minimum requirements promulgated under section 6943 of this title (including new or revised requirements), he shall, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, withdraw his approval of such plan. Such withdrawal of approval shall cease to be effective upon the Administrator’s determination that such complies with such minimum requirements.
