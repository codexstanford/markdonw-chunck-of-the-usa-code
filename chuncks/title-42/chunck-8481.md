##### (i) State option to impose income-related premiums for families of disabled children

(1) With respect to disabled children provided medical assistance under section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX) of this title , subject to paragraph (2), a State may (in a uniform manner for such children) require the families of such children to pay monthly premiums set on a sliding scale based on family income.

(2) A premium requirement imposed under paragraph (1) may only apply to the extent that

(A) in the case of a disabled child described in that paragraph whose family income

(i) does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line, the aggregate amount of such premium and any premium that the parent is required to pay for family coverage under section 1396a(cc)(2)(A)(i) of this title and other cost-sharing charges do not exceed 5 percent of the family’s income; and

(ii) exceeds 200, but does not exceed 300, percent of the poverty line, the aggregate amount of such premium and any premium that the parent is required to pay for family coverage under section 1396a(cc)(2)(A)(i) of this title and other cost-sharing charges do not exceed 7.5 percent of the family’s income; and

(B) the requirement is imposed consistent with section 1396a(cc)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of this title .

(3) A State shall not require prepayment of a premium imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall not terminate eligibility of a child under section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX) of this title for medical assistance under this subchapter on the basis of failure to pay any such premium until such failure continues for a period of at least 60 days from the date on which the premium became past due. The State may waive payment of any such premium in any case where the State determines that requiring such payment would create an undue hardship.
