(v) that a child who has been determined to meet the eligibility criteria described in this subparagraph and who is participating in a Head Start program in a program year shall be considered to continue to meet the eligibility criteria through the end of the succeeding program year.

(2) Whenever a Head Start program is operated in a community with a population of 1,000 or less individuals and
