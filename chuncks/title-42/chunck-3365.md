#### § 299b–33. Health care delivery system research
##### (c) Research functions of Center

(1) In general

The Center shall support, such as through a contract or other mechanism, research on health care delivery system improvement and the development of tools to facilitate adoption of best practices that improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care delivery services. Such support may include establishing a Quality Improvement Network Research Program for the purpose of testing, scaling, and disseminating of interventions to improve quality and efficiency in health care. Recipients of funding under the Program may include national, State, multi-State, or multi-site quality improvement networks.

(2) Research requirements

The research conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall

(A) address the priorities identified by the Secretary in the national strategic plan established under section 280j of this title ;

(B) identify areas in which evidence is insufficient to identify strategies and methodologies, taking into consideration areas of insufficient evidence identified by the entity with a contract under section 1395aaa(a) of this title in the report required under section 280j–2 of this title ;

(C) address concerns identified by health care institutions and providers and communicated through the Center pursuant to subsection (d);

(D) reduce preventable morbidity, mortality, and associated costs of morbidity and mortality by building capacity for patient safety research;

(E) support the discovery of processes for the reliable, safe, efficient, and responsive delivery of health care, taking into account discoveries from clinical research and comparative effectiveness research;

(F) allow communication of research findings and translate evidence into practice recommendations that are adaptable to a variety of settings, and which, as soon as practicable after the establishment of the Center, shall include

(i) the implementation of a national application of Intensive Care Unit improvement projects relating to the adult (including geriatric), pediatric, and neonatal patient populations;

(ii) practical methods for addressing health care associated infections, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus and Vancomycin-Resistant Entercoccus infections and other emerging infections; and

(iii) practical methods for reducing preventable hospital admissions and readmissions;

(G) expand demonstration projects for improving the quality of children’s health care and the use of health information technology, such as through Pediatric Quality Improvement Collaboratives and Learning Networks, consistent with provisions of section 1320b–9a of this title for assessing and improving quality, where applicable;

(H) identify and mitigate hazards by

(i) analyzing events reported to patient safety reporting systems and patient safety organizations; and

(ii) using the results of such analyses to develop scientific methods of response to such events;

(I) include the conduct of systematic reviews of existing practices that improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care delivery, as well as new research on improving such practices; and

(J) include the examination of how to measure and evaluate the progress of quality and patient safety activities.
