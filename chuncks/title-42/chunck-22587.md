#### § 17194. Enhanced geothermal systems research and development
##### (b) Enhanced geothermal systems technologies

In collaboration with industry partners, institutions of higher education, and the national laboratories, the Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of the technologies to achieve higher efficiency and lower cost enhanced geothermal systems, including

(1) reservoir stimulation;

(2) drilled, non-stimulated (e.g. closed-loop) reservoir technologies;

(3) reservoir characterization, monitoring, and modeling and understanding of the surface area and volume of fractures;

(4) stress and fracture mapping including real time monitoring and modeling;

(5) tracer development;

(6) three and four-dimensional seismic imaging and tomography;

(7) well placement and orientation;

(8) long-term reservoir management;

(9) drilling technologies, methods, and tools;

(10) improved exploration tools;

(11) zonal isolation; and

(12) understanding induced seismicity risks from reservoir engineering and stimulation.
