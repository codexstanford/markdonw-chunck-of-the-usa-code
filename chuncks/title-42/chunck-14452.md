### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (d) Standards for central air conditioners and heat pumps

(1) The seasonal energy efficiency ratio of central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps shall be not less than the following:

(A) Split Systems: 10.0 for products manufactured on or after January 1, 1992 .

(B) Single Package Systems: 9.7 for products manufactured on or after January 1, 1993 .

(2) The heating seasonal performance factor of central air conditioning heat pumps shall be not less than the following:

(A) Split Systems: 6.8 for products manufactured on or after January 1, 1992 .

(B) Single Package Systems: 6.6 for products manufactured on or after January 1, 1993 .

(3)

(A) The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than January 1, 1994 , to determine whether the standards established under paragraph (1) should be amended. Such rule shall contain such amendment, if any, and provide that the amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 1999 . The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than January 1, 1994 , to determine whether the standards established under paragraph (2) shall be amended. Such rule shall contain such amendment, if any, and provide that the amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 2002 .

(B) The Secretary shall publish a final rule after January 1, 1994 , and no later than January 1, 2001 , to determine whether the standards in effect for central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps should be amended. Such rule shall provide that any amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 2006 .

(4) Standards for through-the-wall central air conditioners, through-the-wall central air conditioning heat pumps, and small duct, high velocity systems.

(A) Definitions .

In this paragraph:

(i) Small duct, high velocity system .

The term “small duct, high velocity system” means a heating and cooling product that contains a blower and indoor coil combination that

(I) is designed for, and produces, at least 1.2 inches of external static pressure when operated at the certified air volume rate of 220–350 CFM per rated ton of cooling; and

(II) when applied in the field, uses high velocity room outlets generally greater than 1,000 fpm that have less than 6.0 square inches of free area.

(ii) Through-the-wall central air conditioner; through-the-wall central air conditioning heat pump .

The terms “through-the-wall central air conditioner” and “through-the-wall central air conditioning heat pump” mean a central air conditioner or heat pump, respectively, that is designed to be installed totally or partially within a fixed-size opening in an exterior wall, and

(I) is not weatherized;

(II) is clearly and permanently marked for installation only through an exterior wall;

(III) has a rated cooling capacity no greater than 30,000 Btu/hr;

(IV) exchanges all of its outdoor air across a single surface of the equipment cabinet; and

(V) has a combined outdoor air exchange area of less than 800 square inches (split systems) or less than 1,210 square inches (single packaged systems) as measured on the surface area described in subclause (IV).

(iii) Revision .

The Secretary may revise the definitions contained in this subparagraph through publication of a final rule.

(B) Small-duct high-velocity systems.

(i) Seasonal energy efficiency ratio .

The seasonal energy efficiency ratio for small-duct high-velocity systems shall be not less than

(I) 11.00 for products manufactured on or after January 23, 2006 ; and

(II) 12.00 for products manufactured on or after January 1, 2015 .

(ii) Heating seasonal performance factor .

The heating seasonal performance factor for small-duct high-velocity systems shall be not less than

(I) 6.8 for products manufactured on or after January 23, 2006 ; and

(II) 7.2 for products manufactured on or after January 1, 2015 .

(C) Subsequent rulemakings .

The Secretary shall conduct subsequent rulemakings for through-the-wall central air conditioners, through-the-wall central air conditioning heat pumps, and small duct, high velocity systems as part of any rulemaking under this section used to review or revise standards for other central air conditioners and heat pumps.
