(1) In general

Except as otherwise provided, the provisions of this part shall apply under part C with respect to prescription drug coverage provided under MA–PD plans in lieu of the other provisions of part C that would apply to such coverage under such plans.

(2) Waiver

The Secretary shall waive the provisions referred to in paragraph (1) to the extent the Secretary determines that such provisions duplicate, or are in conflict with, provisions otherwise applicable to the organization or plan under part C or as may be necessary in order to improve coordination of this part with the benefits under this part.
