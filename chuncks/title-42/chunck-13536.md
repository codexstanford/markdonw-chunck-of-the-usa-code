#### § 5136. Natural hazard risk assessment
##### (i) Community disaster resilience zone project applications

(1) In general

If required by the President or other Federal law, an eligible entity shall submit to the President an application at such time, in such manner, and containing or accompanied by such information as the President may reasonably require.

(2) Evaluation and certification

(A) In general

Not later than 120 days after the date on which an eligible entity submits an application under paragraph (1), the President shall evaluate the application to determine whether the resilience or mitigation project that the entity plans to perform within, or that primarily benefits, a community disaster resilience zone

(i) is designed to reduce injuries, loss of life, and damage and destruction of property, such as damage to critical services and facilities; and

(ii) substantially reduces the risk of, or increases resilience to, future damage, hardship, loss, or suffering.

(B) Certification

If the President determines that an application submitted under paragraph (1) meets the criteria described in subparagraph (A), the President shall certify the proposed resilience or mitigation project.

(C) Effect of certification

The certification of a proposed resilience or mitigation project under subparagraph (B) shall not be construed to exempt the resilience or mitigation project from the requirements of any other law.

(3) Projects causing displacement

With respect to a resilience or mitigation project certified under paragraph (2)(B) that involves the displacement of a resident from any occupied housing unit, the entity performing the resilience or mitigation project shall

(A) provide, at the option of the resident, a suitable and habitable housing unit that is, with respect to the housing unit from which the resident is displaced

(i) of a comparable size;

(ii) located in the same local community or a community with reduced hazard risk; and

(iii) offered under similar costs, conditions, and terms;

(B) ensure that property acquisitions resulting from the displacement and made in connection with the resilience or mitigation project

(i) are deed restricted in perpetuity to preclude future property uses not relating to mitigation or resilience; and

(ii) are the result of a voluntary decision by the resident; and

(C) plan for robust public participation in the resilience or mitigation project.
