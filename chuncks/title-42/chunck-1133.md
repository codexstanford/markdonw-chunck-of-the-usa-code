##### (h) Sanctions

(1) In general

In order to promote voluntary compliance with this section, the Secretary may, in lieu of taking the actions authorized by subsection (i), impose one or more of the following sanctions:

(A) Directed plans of correction which afford a facility an opportunity to correct violations in a timely manner.

(B) Payment for the cost of onsite monitoring.

(2) Patient information

If the Secretary determines that the quality of mammography performed by a facility (whether or not certified pursuant to subsection (c)) was so inconsistent with the quality standards established pursuant to subsection (f) as to present a significant risk to individual or public health, the Secretary may require such facility to notify patients who received mammograms at such facility, and their referring physicians, of the deficiencies presenting such risk, the potential harm resulting, appropriate remedial measures, and such other relevant information as the Secretary may require.

(3) Civil money penalties

The Secretary may assess civil money penalties in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for

(A) failure to obtain a certificate as required by subsection (b),

(B) each failure by a facility to substantially comply with, or each day on which a facility fails to substantially comply with, the standards established under subsection (f) or the requirements described in subclauses (I) through (III) of subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii),

(C) each failure to notify a patient of risk as required by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2), and

(D) each violation, or for each aiding and abetting in a violation of, any provision of, or regulation promulgated under, this section by an owner, operator, or any employee of a facility required to have a certificate.

(4) Procedures

The Secretary shall develop and implement procedures with respect to when and how each of the sanctions is to be imposed under paragraphs (1) through (3). Such procedures shall provide for notice to the owner or operator of the facility and a reasonable opportunity for the owner or operator to respond to the proposed sanctions and appropriate procedures for appealing determinations relating to the imposition of sanctions.
