#### § 13257. Fleet requirement program
##### (b) Early rulemaking

(1) Not earlier than 1 year after October 24, 1992 , and after carrying out the requirements of subsection (a), the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to determine whether a fleet requirement program to begin in calendar year 1998 (when model year 1999 begins), or such other later date as he may select pursuant to subsection (a), is necessary under this section. Such rule, consistent with subsection (a)(1), shall establish the annual applicable model year percentage. No rule under this subsection may be promulgated after December 15, 1996 , and be enforceable. A fleet requirement program shall be considered necessary and a rule therefor shall be promulgated if the Secretary finds that

(A) the goal of replacement fuel use described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title , is not expected to be actually achieved by 2010, or such other date as is established under section 13254 of this title , by voluntary means or pursuant to this subchapter or any other law without such a fleet requirement program, taking into consideration the status of the achievement of the interim goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(A) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title ;

(B) such goal is practicable and actually achievable within periods specified in section 13252(b)(2) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title , through implementation of such a fleet requirement program in combination with voluntary means and the application of other programs relevant to achieving such goals; and

(C) by 1998 (when model year 1999 begins) or the date specified by the Secretary in such rule for initiating a fleet requirement program

(i) there exists sufficient evidence to ensure that the fuel and the needed infrastructure, including the supply and deliverability systems, will be installed and located at convenient places in the fleet areas subject to the rule and will be fully operational when the rule is effective to offer a reliable and timely supply of the applicable alternative fuel at reasonable costs (as compared to conventional fuels) to meet the fleet requirement program, as demonstrated through use of the provisions of section 13255(1) of this title regarding voluntary commitments or other adequate, reliable, and convincing forms of agreements, arrangements, or representations that such fuels and infrastructure are in existence or will exist when the rule is effective and will be expanded as the percentages increase annually;

(ii) there will be a sufficient number of new alternative fueled vehicles from original equipment manufacturers that comply with all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act [ 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] and chapter 301 of title 49;

(iii) such new vehicles will meet the applicable non-Federal and non-State fleet performance requirements of such fleets (including range, passenger or cargo-carrying capacity, reliability, refueling capability, vehicle mix, and economical operation and maintenance); and

(iv) establishment of a fleet requirement program by rule under this subsection will not result in unfair competitive advantages or disadvantages, or result in undue economic hardship, to the affected fleets.

(2) The Secretary shall not promulgate a rule under this subsection if he is unable to make affirmative findings in the case of each of the subparagraphs under paragraph (1), and each of the clauses under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1).

(3) If the Secretary does not determine that such program is necessary under this subsection, the provisions of subsection (e) shall apply to the consideration in the future of any fleet requirement program. The record of this rulemaking, including the Secretary’s findings, shall be incorporated into a rulemaking under that subsection. If the Secretary determines under this subsection that such program is necessary, the Secretary shall not initiate the later rulemaking under subsection (e).
