#### § 1395yy. Payment to skilled nursing facilities for routine service costs
##### (d) Access to skilled nursing facilities

(1) Subject to subsection (e), any skilled nursing facility may choose to be paid under this subsection on the basis of a prospective payment for all routine service costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this subchapter) and capital-related costs of extended care services provided in a cost reporting period if such facility had, in the preceding cost reporting period, fewer than 1,500 patient days with respect to which payments were made under this subchapter. Such prospective payment shall be in lieu of payments which would otherwise be made for routine service costs pursuant to section 1395x(v) of this title and subsections (a) through (c) of this section and capital-related costs pursuant to section 1395x(v) of this title . This subsection shall not apply to a facility for any cost reporting period immediately following a cost reporting period in which such facility had 1,500 or more patient days with respect to which payments were made under this subchapter, without regard to whether payments were made under this subsection during such preceding cost reporting period.

(2)

(A) The amount of the payment under this section shall be determined on a per diem basis.
