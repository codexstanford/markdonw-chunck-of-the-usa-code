#### § 300ff–13. Type and distribution of grants
##### (c) Timeframe for obligation and expenditure of grant funds

(1) Obligation by end of grant year

Effective for fiscal year 2007 and subsequent fiscal years, funds from a grant award made pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) for a fiscal year are available for obligation by the eligible area involved through the end of the one-year period beginning on the date in such fiscal year on which funds from the award first become available to the area (referred to in this subsection as the “grant year for the award”), except as provided in paragraph (3)(A).

(2) Supplemental grants; cancellation of unobligated balance of grant award

Effective for fiscal year 2007 and subsequent fiscal years, if a grant award made pursuant to subsection (b) for an eligible area for a fiscal year has an unobligated balance as of the end of the grant year for the award

(A) the Secretary shall cancel that unobligated balance of the award, and shall require the eligible area to return any amounts from such balance that have been disbursed to the area; and

(B) the funds involved shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants pursuant to subsection (b) for the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the Secretary obtains the information necessary for determining that the balance is required under subparagraph (A) to be canceled, except that the availability of the funds for such grants is subject to subsection (a)(4) and section 300ff–20(d)(2) of this title as applied for such year.

(3) Formula grants; cancellation of unobligated balance of grant award; waiver permitting carryover

(A) In general

Effective for fiscal year 2007 and subsequent fiscal years, if a grant award made pursuant to subsection (a) for an eligible area for a fiscal year has an unobligated balance as of the end of the grant year for the award, the Secretary shall cancel that unobligated balance of the award, and shall require the eligible area to return any amounts from such balance that have been disbursed to the area, unless

(i) before the end of the grant year, the chief elected official of the area submits to the Secretary a written application for a waiver of the cancellation, which application includes a description of the purposes for which the area intends to expend the funds involved; and

(ii) the Secretary approves the waiver.

(B) Expenditure by end of carryover year

With respect to a waiver under subparagraph (A) that is approved for a balance that is unobligated as of the end of a grant year for an award:

(i) The unobligated funds are available for expenditure by the eligible area involved for the one-year period beginning upon the expiration of the grant year (referred to in this subsection as the “carryover year”).

(ii) If the funds are not expended by the end of the carryover year, the Secretary shall cancel that unexpended balance of the award, and shall require the eligible area to return any amounts from such balance that have been disbursed to the area.

(C) Use of cancelled balances

In the case of any balance of a grant award that is cancelled under subparagraph (A) or (B)(ii), the grant funds involved shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants pursuant to subsection (b) for the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the Secretary obtains the information necessary for determining that the balance is required under such subparagraph to be canceled, except that the availability of the funds for such grants is subject to subsection (a)(4) and section 300ff–20(d)(2) of this title as applied for such year.

(D) Corresponding reduction in future grant

(i) In general

In the case of an eligible area for which a balance from a grant award under subsection (a) is unobligated as of the end of the grant year for the award

(I) the Secretary shall reduce, by the same amount as such unobligated balance (less any amount of such balance that is the subject of a waiver of cancellation under subparagraph (A)), the amount of the grant under such subsection for the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the Secretary obtains the information necessary for determining that such balance was unobligated as of the end of the grant year (which requirement for a reduction applies without regard to whether a waiver under subparagraph (A) has been approved with respect to such balance); and

(II) the grant funds involved in such reduction shall be made available by the Secretary as additional funds for grants pursuant to subsection (b) for such first fiscal year, subject to subsection (a)(4) and section 300ff–20(d)(2) of this title ;  except that this clause does not apply to the eligible area if the amount of the unobligated balance was 5 percent or less.

(ii) Relation to increases in grant

A reduction under clause (i) for an eligible area for a fiscal year may not be taken into account in applying subsection (a)(4) with respect to the area for the subsequent fiscal year.

(4) Authority regarding administration of provisions

In administering paragraphs (2) and (3) with respect to the unobligated balance of an eligible area, the Secretary may elect to reduce the amount of future grants to the area under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable, by the amount of any such unobligated balance in lieu of cancelling such amount as provided for in paragraph (2) or (3)(A). In such case, the Secretary may permit the area to use such unobligated balance for purposes of any such future grant. An amount equal to such reduction shall be available for use as additional amounts for grants pursuant to subsection (b), subject to subsection (a)(4) and section 300ff–20(d)(2) of this title . Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary under paragraphs (2) and (3), including the authority to grant waivers under paragraph (3)(A). The reduction in future grants authorized under this paragraph shall be notwithstanding the penalty required under paragraph (3)(D) with respect to unobligated funds.
