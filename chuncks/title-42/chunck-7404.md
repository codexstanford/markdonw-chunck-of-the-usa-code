#### § 1395u. Provisions relating to the administration of part B
##### (n) Elimination of markup for certain purchased services

(1) If a physician’s bill or a request for payment for services billed by a physician includes a charge for a diagnostic test described in section 1395x(s)(3) of this title (other than a clinical diagnostic laboratory test) for which the bill or request for payment does not indicate that the billing physician personally performed or supervised the performance of the test or that another physician with whom the physician who shares a practice personally performed or supervised the performance of the test, the amount payable with respect to the test shall be determined as follows:

(A) If the bill or request for payment indicates that the test was performed by a supplier, identifies the supplier, and indicates the amount the supplier charged the billing physician, payment for the test (less the applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts) shall be the actual acquisition costs (net of any discounts) or, if lower, the supplier’s reasonable charge (or other applicable limit) for the test.

(B) If the bill or request for payment (i) does not indicate who performed the test, or (ii) indicates that the test was performed by a supplier but does not identify the supplier or include the amount charged by the supplier, no payment shall be made under this part.

(2) A physician may not bill an individual enrolled under this part

(A) any amount other than the payment amount specified in paragraph (1)(A) and any applicable deductible and coinsurance for a diagnostic test for which payment is made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), or

(B) any amount for a diagnostic test for which payment may not be made pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).

(3) If a physician knowingly and willfully in repeated cases bills one or more individuals in violation of paragraph (2), the Secretary may apply sanctions against such physician in accordance with subsection (j)(2).
