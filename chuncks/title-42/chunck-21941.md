#### § 16313. Solar Fuels Research Initiative
##### (c) Biochemistry, replication of natural photosynthesis, and related processes

(1) In general

The Secretary shall carry out under the Initiative a program to support research needed to replicate natural photosynthetic processes by use of artificial photosynthetic components and materials.

(2) Activities

As part of the program described in paragraph (1)

(A) the Director of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences shall support basic research to expand fundamental knowledge to replicate natural synthesis processes, including

(i) the photoinduced reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia;

(ii) the absorption of carbon dioxide from ambient air;

(iii) molecular-based charge separation and storage;

(iv) photoinitiated electron transfer; and

(v) catalysis in biological or biomimetic systems;

(B) the Associate Director of Biological and Environmental Research shall support systems biology and genomics approaches to understand genetic and physiological pathways connected to photosynthetic mechanisms; and

(C) the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy shall support translational research, development, and validation of physical concepts developed under the program.

(3) Standard of review

The Secretary shall review activities carried out under the program described in paragraph (1) to determine the achievement of technical milestones.

(4) Funds

Of the funds authorized to be appropriated for basic energy sciences in a fiscal year, there is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out activities under this subsection $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027.
