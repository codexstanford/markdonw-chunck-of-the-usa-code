#### § 6363. Federal actions with respect to recycled oil
##### (d) Promulgation of rules prescribing test procedures and labeling standards
######## (A) Within 90 days after the date on which the Commission receives the report under subsection (c), the Commission shall, by rule, prescribe

(i) test procedures for the determination of substantial equivalency of re-refined or otherwise processed used oil or blend of oil, consisting of such re-refined or otherwise processed used oil and new oil or additives, with new oil distributed for a particular end use; and

(ii) labeling standards applicable to containers of recycled oil in order to carry out the purposes of this section.

(B) Such labeling standards shall permit any container of recycled oil to bear a label indicating any particular end use for which a determination of substantial equivalency has been made pursuant to subparagraph (A)(i).

(2) Not later than the expiration of such 90-day period, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, by rule, prescribe labeling standards applicable to containers of new oil, used oil, and recycled oil relating to the proper disposal of such oils after use. Such standards shall be designed to reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, environmental hazards and wasteful practices associated with the disposal of such oils after use.
