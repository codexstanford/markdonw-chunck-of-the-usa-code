#### § 1395l. Payment of benefits
##### (i) Outpatient surgery
######## (A) For services furnished prior to the implementation of the system described in subparagraph (D), subject to subparagraph (E), the amount of payment to be made for facility services furnished in connection with a surgical procedure specified pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) and furnished to an individual in an ambulatory surgical center described in such paragraph shall be equal to 80 percent of a standard overhead amount established by the Secretary (with respect to each such procedure) on the basis of the Secretary’s estimate of a fair fee which

(i) takes into account the costs incurred by such centers, or classes of centers, generally in providing services furnished in connection with the performance of such procedure, as determined in accordance with a survey (based upon a representative sample of procedures and facilities) of the actual audited costs incurred by such centers in providing such services,

(ii) takes such costs into account in such a manner as will assure that the performance of the procedure in such a center will result in substantially less amounts paid under this subchapter than would have been paid if the procedure had been performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital, and

(iii) in the case of insertion of an intraocular lens during or subsequent to cataract surgery includes payment which is reasonable and related to the cost of acquiring the class of lens involved. Each amount so established shall be reviewed and updated not later than July 1, 1987 , and annually thereafter to take account of varying conditions in different areas.
