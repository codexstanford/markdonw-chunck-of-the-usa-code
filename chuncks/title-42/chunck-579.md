##### (c) Authority to expedite peer review

(1) In general

The Secretary may, as the Secretary determines necessary to respond to pressing qualified countermeasure research and development needs under this section, employ such expedited peer review procedures (including consultation with appropriate scientific experts) as the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of NIH, deems appropriate to obtain assessment of scientific and technical merit and likely contribution to the field of qualified countermeasure research, in place of the peer review and advisory council review procedures that would be required under sections 241(a)(3), 284(b)(1)(B), 284(b)(2), 284a(a)(3)(A), 289a, and 289c of this title, as applicable to a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement

(A) that is for performing, administering, or supporting qualified countermeasure research and development activities; and

(B) the amount of which is not greater than $1,500,000.

(2) Subsequent phases of research

The Secretary’s determination of whether to employ expedited peer review with respect to any subsequent phases of a research grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under this section shall be determined without regard to the peer review procedures used for any prior peer review of that same grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. Nothing in the preceding sentence may be construed to impose any requirement with respect to peer review not otherwise required under any other law or regulation.
