### CHAPTER 50— NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE
#### § 4057. Alternative loss allocation system for indeterminate claims
##### (c) Authorized use of post-storm assessment and COASTAL Formula

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (3), the Administrator may use the post-storm assessment and the COASTAL Formula to

(A) review flood loss payments for indeterminate losses, including as part of the quality assurance reinspection program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for claims under the national flood insurance program and any other process approved by the Administrator to review and validate payments under the national flood insurance program for indeterminate losses following a named storm; and

(B) assist the national flood insurance program to

(i) properly cover qualified flood loss for claims for indeterminate losses; and

(ii) avoid paying for any loss or damage to property caused by any peril (including wind), other than flood or storm surge, that is not covered under a standard policy under the national flood insurance program.

(2) Federal disaster declaration

Subject to paragraph (3), in order to expedite claims and reduce costs to the national flood insurance program, following any major disaster declared by the President under section 5170 of this title relating to a named storm in a coastal State, the Administrator may use the COASTAL Formula to determine and pay for any flood loss covered under a standard insurance policy under the national flood insurance program, if the loss is an indeterminate loss.

(3) National Academy of Sciences evaluation

(A) Evaluation required

(i) Evaluation

Upon publication of the COASTAL Formula in the Federal Register as required by subsection (b)(1), and each time the Administrator modifies the COASTAL Formula, the National Academy of Sciences shall

(I) evaluate the expected financial impact on the national flood insurance program of the use of the COASTAL Formula as so established or modified; and

(II) evaluate the validity of the scientific assumptions upon which the formula is based and determine whether the COASTAL formula  1 can achieve a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent in allocating flood losses for indeterminate losses.

(ii) Report

The National Academy of Sciences shall submit a report containing the results of each evaluation under clause (i) to the Administrator, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives.

(B) Effective date and applicability

(i) Effective date

Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not take effect unless the report under subparagraph (A) relating to the establishment of the COASTAL Formula concludes that the use of the COASTAL Formula for purposes of paragraph  2 (1) and (2) would not have an adverse financial impact on the national flood insurance program and that the COASTAL Formula is based on valid scientific assumptions that would allow a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent to be achieved in allocating flood losses for indeterminate losses.

(ii) Effect of modifications

Unless the report under subparagraph (A) relating to a modification of the COASTAL Formula concludes that the use of the COASTAL Formula, as so modified, for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) would not have an adverse financial impact on the national flood insurance program and that the COASTAL Formula is based on valid scientific assumptions that would allow a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent to be achieved in allocating flood losses for indeterminate losses the Administrator may not use the COASTAL Formula, as so modified, for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2).

(C) Funding

Notwithstanding section 4017 of this title , there shall be available to the Administrator from the National Flood Insurance Fund, of amounts not otherwise obligated, not more than $750,000 to carry out this paragraph.
