### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1397dd. Allotments
##### (i) Redistribution of unused fiscal year 2005 allotments to States with estimated funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2008

(1) In general

Notwithstanding subsection (f) and subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), with respect to months beginning during fiscal year 2008, the Secretary shall provide for a redistribution under such subsection from the allotments for fiscal year 2005 under subsection (b) that are not expended by the end of fiscal year 2007, to a fiscal year 2008 shortfall State described in paragraph (2), such amount as the Secretary determines will eliminate the estimated shortfall described in such paragraph for such State for the month.

(2) Fiscal year 2008 shortfall State described

A fiscal year 2008 shortfall State described in this paragraph is a State with a State child health plan approved under this subchapter for which the Secretary estimates, on a monthly basis using the most recent data available to the Secretary as of such month, that the projected expenditures under such plan for such State for fiscal year 2008 will exceed the sum of

(A) the amount of the State’s allotments for each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that was not expended by the end of fiscal year 2007; and

(B) the amount of the State’s allotment for fiscal year 2008.

(3) Funds redistributed in the order in which States realize funding shortfalls

The Secretary shall redistribute the amounts available for redistribution under paragraph (1) to fiscal year 2008 shortfall States described in paragraph (2) in the order in which such States realize monthly funding shortfalls under this subchapter for fiscal year 2008. The Secretary shall only make redistributions under this subsection to the extent that there are unexpended fiscal year 2005 allotments under subsection (b) available for such redistributions.

(4) Proration rule

If the amounts available for redistribution under paragraph (1) are less than the total amounts of the estimated shortfalls determined for the month under that paragraph, the amount computed under such paragraph for each fiscal year 2008 shortfall State for the month shall be reduced proportionally.

(5) Retrospective adjustment

The Secretary may adjust the estimates and determinations made to carry out this subsection as necessary on the basis of the amounts reported by States not later than November 30, 2007 , on CMS Form 64 or CMS Form 21, as the case may be, and as approved by the Secretary.

(6) 1–year availability; no further redistribution

Notwithstanding subsections (e) and (f), amounts redistributed to a State pursuant to this subsection for fiscal year 2008 shall only remain available for expenditure by the State through September 30, 2008 , and any amounts of such redistributions that remain unexpended as of such date, shall not be subject to redistribution under subsection (f).
