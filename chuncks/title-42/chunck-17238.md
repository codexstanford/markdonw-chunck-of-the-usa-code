### CHAPTER 92— POWERPLANT AND INDUSTRIAL FUEL USE
#### § 8352. Permanent exemptions
##### (a) Permanent exemption due to lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, or environmental requirements

(1) After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption from one or more of the prohibitions of part A for a powerplant, the Secretary shall, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection for the use of natural gas or petroleum, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that despite diligent good faith efforts

(A) it is likely that an adequate and reliable supply of coal or other alternate fuels of the quality necessary to conform with design and operational requirements for use as a primary energy source will not be available to such powerplant at a cost (taking into account associated facilities for the transportation and use of such fuel) which, based upon the best practicable estimates, does not substantially exceed the cost, as determined by rule by the Secretary, of using imported petroleum as a primary energy source during the remaining useful life of the powerplant;

(B) one or more site limitations exist which would not permit the operation of such a powerplant using coal or any other alternate fuel as a primary energy source; or

(C) the prohibitions of part A could not be satisfied without violating applicable environmental requirements.

(2) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, a powerplant which has been granted an exemption under subsection (g) may not be granted an exemption under this subsection.
