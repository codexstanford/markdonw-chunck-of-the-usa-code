(1) In general

The Director shall carry out a 4-year pilot program under which the Director shall make awards, on a competitive basis, to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations (or consortia of such institutions or organizations) to establish a total of not fewer than five Centers to develop and scale up successful models for providing undergraduate students with hands-on, course-based research experiences.

(2) Use of funds

Awards made under this paragraph shall be used to

(A) develop, assess, and disseminate models for providing undergraduate students with course-based research experiences across STEM disciplines and education levels;

(B) identify and address opportunities and challenges in facilitating implementation across a broad range of institution types, including historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, minority serving institutions and community colleges;

(C) identify and develop best practices to address barriers for faculty, including institutional culture, resources, and incentive structures;

(E) provide faculty with curriculum, professional development, training, networking opportunities, and other support to enable the development, adaptation, or expansion of a course-based research experience; and

(F) collect data and carry out research to evaluate the impacts of course-based undergraduate research experiences on the STEM workforce.

(3) Partnerships

In making awards under this paragraph, the Director shall consider the extent to which the proposed Center will establish partnerships among multiple types of academic institutions, including community colleges, emerging research institutions, EPSCoR institutions, historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-serving institutions, the private sector, and other relevant stakeholders in supporting programs and activities to facilitate faculty training and the widespread and sustained implementation of promising, evidence-based practices, models, programs, and curriculum.

(4) Report

Not later than 180 days after the date on which the pilot program is completed, the Director shall submit to Congress a report that includes

(A) an assessment, that includes feedback from the research community, of the effectiveness of the pilot program in increasing the number, diversity, and workforce readiness of STEM graduates; and

(B) if determined to be effective, a plan for permanent implementation of the pilot program.
