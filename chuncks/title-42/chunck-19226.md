### CHAPTER 120— ENTERPRISE ZONE DEVELOPMENT
#### § 11504. Waiver or modification of housing and community development rules in enterprise zones
##### (d) Consideration of requests

In considering a request, the Secretary shall weigh the extent to which the proposed change is likely to further job creation, community development, or economic revitalization within the enterprise zone against the effect the change is likely to have on the underlying purposes of applicable statutes in the geographic area that would be affected by the change. The Secretary shall approve the request whenever the Secretary finds, in the discretion of the Secretary, that the public interest that the proposed change would serve in furthering such job creation, community development or economic revitalization outweighs the public interest that continuation of the rule unchanged would serve in furthering such underlying purposes. The Secretary shall not approve any request to waive or modify a rule if that waiver or modification would

(1) directly violate a statutory requirement; or

(2) be likely to present a significant risk to the public health, including environmental health or safety.
