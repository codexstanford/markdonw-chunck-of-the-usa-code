#### § 1396s. Program for distribution of pediatric vaccines
##### (d) Negotiation of contracts with manufacturers

(1) In general

For the purpose of meeting obligations under this section, the Secretary shall negotiate and enter into contracts with manufacturers of pediatric vaccines consistent with the requirements of this subsection and, to the maximum extent practicable, consolidate such contracting with any other contracting activities conducted by the Secretary to purchase vaccines. The Secretary may enter into such contracts under which the Federal Government is obligated to make outlays, the budget authority for which is not provided for in advance in appropriations Acts, for the purchase and delivery of pediatric vaccines under subsection (a)(2)(A).

(2) Authority to decline contracts

The Secretary may decline to enter into such contracts and may modify or extend such contracts.

(3) Contract price

(A) In general

The Secretary, in negotiating the prices at which pediatric vaccines will be purchased and delivered from a manufacturer under this subsection, shall take into account quantities of vaccines to be purchased by States under the option under paragraph (4)(B).

(B) Negotiation of discounted price for current vaccines

With respect to contracts entered into under this subsection for a pediatric vaccine for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a contract in effect under section 247b(j)(1) of this title as of May 1, 1993 , no price for the purchase of such vaccine for vaccine-eligible children shall be agreed to by the Secretary under this subsection if the price per dose of such vaccine (including delivery costs and any applicable excise tax established under section 4131 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) exceeds the price per dose for the vaccine in effect under such a contract as of such date increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) from May 1993 to the month before the month in which such contract is entered into.

(C) Negotiation of discounted price for new vaccines

With respect to contracts entered into for a pediatric vaccine not described in subparagraph (B), the price for the purchase of such vaccine shall be a discounted price negotiated by the Secretary that may be established without regard to such subparagraph.

(4) Quantities and terms of delivery

Under such contracts

(A) the Secretary shall provide, consistent with paragraph (6), for the purchase and delivery on behalf of States (and tribes and tribal organizations) of quantities of pediatric vaccines for federally vaccine-eligible children; and

(B) each State, at the option of the State, shall be permitted to obtain additional quantities of pediatric vaccines (subject to amounts specified to the Secretary by the State in advance of negotiations) through purchasing the vaccines from the manufacturers at the applicable price negotiated by the Secretary consistent with paragraph (3), if (i) the State agrees that the vaccines will be used to provide immunizations only for children who are not federally vaccine-eligible children and (ii) the State provides to the Secretary such information (at a time and manner specified by the Secretary, including in advance of negotiations under paragraph (1)) as the Secretary determines to be necessary, to provide for quantities of pediatric vaccines for the State to purchase pursuant to this subsection and to determine annually the percentage of the vaccine market that is purchased pursuant to this section and this subparagraph. The Secretary shall enter into the initial negotiations under the preceding sentence not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993 .

(5) Charges for shipping and handling

The Secretary may enter into a contract referred to in paragraph (1) only if the manufacturer involved agrees to submit to the Secretary such reports as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to assure compliance with the contract and if, with respect to a State program under this section that does not provide for the direct delivery of qualified pediatric vaccines, the manufacturer involved agrees that the manufacturer will provide for the delivery of the vaccines on behalf of the State in accordance with such program and will not impose any charges for the costs of such delivery (except to the extent such costs are provided for in the price established under paragraph (3)).

(6) Assuring adequate supply of vaccines

The Secretary, in negotiations under paragraph (1), shall negotiate for quantities of pediatric vaccines such that an adequate supply of such vaccines will be maintained to meet unanticipated needs for the vaccines. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall negotiate for a 6-month supply of vaccines in addition to the quantity that the Secretary otherwise would provide for in such negotiations. In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider the potential for outbreaks of the diseases with respect to which the vaccines have been developed.

(7) Multiple suppliers

In the case of the pediatric vaccine involved, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, enter into a contract referred to in paragraph (1) with each manufacturer of the vaccine that meets the terms and conditions of the Secretary for an award of such a contract (including terms and conditions regarding safety and quality). With respect to multiple contracts entered into pursuant to this paragraph, the Secretary may have in effect different prices under each of such contracts and, with respect to a purchase by States pursuant to paragraph (4)(B), the Secretary shall determine which of such contracts will be applicable to the purchase.
