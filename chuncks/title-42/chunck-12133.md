(1) assisting eligible entities in prioritizing, on a continuing basis, the needs of the service population of the entities relating to elder rights;

(2) making grants to eligible entities to carry out vulnerable elder rights protection activities that the entities determine to be priorities; and

(3) enabling the eligible entities to support multidisciplinary elder justice activities, such as

(A) establishing a coordinating council, which shall identify the needs of an individual Indian tribe or other Native American group and provide the Assistant Secretary with information and recommendations relating to efforts by the Indian tribe or the governing entity of the Native American group to combat elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation;

(B) providing training, technical assistance, and other methods of support to groups carrying out multidisciplinary efforts for an Indian tribe or other Native American group; and

(C) broadening and studying various models for elder fatality and serious injury review teams, to make recommendations about their composition, protocols, functions, timing, roles, and responsibilities, with a goal of producing models and information that will allow for replication based on the needs of Indian tribes and other Native American groups (other than the ones in which the review teams were used).
