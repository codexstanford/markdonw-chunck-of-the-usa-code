### CHAPTER 161— DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
#### § 18641. Basic energy sciences
##### (h) Computational materials and chemical sciences

(1) In general

The Director shall support a program of research and development for the application of advanced computing practices to foundational and emerging research problems in chemistry and materials science. Research activities shall include

(A) chemical catalysis research and development;

(B) the use of large data sets to model materials phenomena, including through advanced characterization of materials, materials synthesis, processing, and innovative use of experimental and theoretical data;

(C) codesign of chemical system and chemistry modeling software with advanced computing systems and hardware technologies; and

(D) modeling of chemical processes, assemblies, and reactions such as molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry, including through novel computing methods.

(2) Computational materials and chemical sciences centers

(A) In general

In carrying out the activities authorized under paragraph (1), the Director shall select and establish up to 6 computational materials and chemical sciences centers to

(i) develop open-source, robust, and validated computational codes and user-friendly software, coupled with innovative use of experimental and theoretical data, to enable the design, discovery, and development of new materials and chemical systems; and

(ii) focus on overcoming challenges and maximizing the benefits of exascale and other high performance computing underpinned by accelerated node technologies.

(B) Selection

The Director shall select centers under subparagraph (A) on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis. The Director shall consider applications from the National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, multi-institutional collaborations, and other appropriate entities.

(C) Duration

(i) New centers

A center selected under subparagraph (A) shall receive support for a period of not more than 5 years beginning on the date of establishment of that center, subject to the availability of appropriations.

(ii) Existing centers

A center already in existence on August 9, 2022 , may continue to receive support for a period of not more than 5 years beginning on the date of establishment of that center.

(D) Renewal

Upon the expiration of any period of support of a center under this subsection, the Director may renew support for the center, on a merit-reviewed basis, for a period of not more than 5 years.
