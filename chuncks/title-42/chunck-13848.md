#### § 5305. Activities eligible for assistance

(1) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish, by regulation, guidelines to assist grant recipients under this chapter to evaluate and select activities described in subsection (a)(14), (15), and (17) for assistance with grant amounts. The Secretary shall not base a determination of eligibility of the use of funds under this chapter for such assistance solely on the basis that the recipient fails to achieve one or more of the guidelines’ objectives as stated in paragraph (2).

(2) Project costs and financial requirements

The guidelines established under this subsection shall include the following objectives:

(A) The project costs of such activities are reasonable.

(B) To the extent practicable, reasonable financial support has been committed for such activities from non-Federal sources prior to disbursement of Federal funds.

(C) To the extent practicable, any grant amounts to be provided for such activities do not substantially reduce the amount of non-Federal financial support for the activity.

(D) Such activities are financially feasible.

(E) To the extent practicable, such activities provide not more than a reasonable return on investment to the owner.

(F) To the extent practicable, grant amounts used for the costs of such activities are disbursed on a pro rata basis with amounts from other sources.

(3) Public benefit

The guidelines established under this subsection shall provide that the public benefit provided by the activity is appropriate relative to the amount of assistance provided with grant amounts under this chapter.
