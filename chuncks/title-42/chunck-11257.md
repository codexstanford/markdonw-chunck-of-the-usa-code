#### § 2210a. Conflicts of interest relating to contracts and other arrangements
##### (b) Evaluation

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not enter into any such contract agreement or arrangement unless it finds, after evaluating all information provided under subsection (a) and any other information otherwise available to the Commission that

(A) it is unlikely that a conflict of interest would exist, or

(B) such conflict has been avoided after appropriate conditions have been included in such contract, agreement, or arrangement; except that if the Commission determines that such conflict of interest exists and that such conflict of interest cannot be avoided by including appropriate conditions therein, the Commission may enter into such contract, agreement, or arrangement, if the Commission determines that it is in the best interests of the United States to do so and includes appropriate conditions in such contract, agreement, or arrangement to mitigate such conflict.

(2) Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Notwithstanding any conflict of interest, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may enter into a contract, agreement, or arrangement with the Department of Energy or the operator of a Department of Energy facility, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determines that

(A) the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated; and

(B) adequate justification exists to proceed without mitigation of the conflict of interest.
