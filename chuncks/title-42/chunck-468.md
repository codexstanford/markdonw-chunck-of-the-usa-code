### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 247b–21. Mosquito-borne diseases; coordination grants to States; assessment and control grants to political subdivisions
##### (b) Prevention and control grants to political subdivisions

(1) In general

The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make grants to political subdivisions of States or consortia of political subdivisions of States, for the operation, including improvement, of control programs.

(2) Preference in making grants

In making grants under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give preference to a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions that

(A) has

(i) a history of elevated incidence or prevalence of mosquito-borne disease;

(ii) a population of infected mosquitoes;

(iii) met criteria determined by the Secretary to suggest an increased risk of elevated incidence or prevalence of mosquito-borne disease in the pending fiscal year, including an emerging infectious mosquito-borne disease that presents a serious public health threat; or

(iv) a public health emergency due to the incidence or prevalence of a mosquito-borne disease that presents a serious public health threat;

(B) demonstrates to the Secretary that such political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions will, if appropriate to the mosquito circumstances involved, effectively coordinate the activities of the control programs with contiguous political subdivisions;

(C) demonstrates to the Secretary (directly or through State officials) that the State in which such a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions is located has identified or will identify geographic areas in such State that have a significant need for control programs and will effectively coordinate such programs in such areas; and

(D)

(i) is located in a State that has received a grant under subsection (a); or

(ii) that  1 demonstrates to the Secretary that the control program is consistent with existing State mosquito control plans or policies, or other applicable State preparedness plans.

(3) Requirement of assessment and plan

A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if the political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions involved

(A) has conducted an assessment to determine the immediate needs in such subdivision or consortium for a control program, including an entomological survey of potential mosquito breeding areas; and

(B) has, on the basis of such assessment, developed a plan for carrying out such a program.

(4) Requirement of matching funds

(A) In general

With respect to the costs of a control program to be carried out under paragraph (1) by a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions, a grant under such paragraph may be made only if the subdivision or consortium agrees to make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that is not less than ⅓ of such costs ($1 for each $2 of Federal funds provided in the grant).

(B) Determination of amount contributed

Non-Federal contributions required in subparagraph (A) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.

(C) Waiver

The Secretary may waive the requirement established in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that

(i) extraordinary economic conditions in the political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions involved justify the waiver; or

(ii) the geographical area covered by a political subdivision or consortium for a grant under paragraph (1) has an extreme mosquito control need due to

(I) the size or density of the potentially impacted human population;

(II) the size or density of a mosquito population that requires heightened control; or

(III) the severity of the mosquito-borne disease, such that expected serious adverse health outcomes for the human population justify the waiver.

(5) Reports to Secretary

A grant may be made under paragraph (1) only if the political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions involved agrees that, promptly after the end of the fiscal year for which the grant is made, the subdivision or consortium will submit to the Secretary, and to the State within which the subdivision or consortium is located, a report that describes the control program and contains an evaluation of whether the program was effective.

(6) Number of grants

A political subdivision or a consortium of political subdivisions may not receive more than one grant under paragraph (1).
