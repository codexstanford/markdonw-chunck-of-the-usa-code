### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396s. Program for distribution of pediatric vaccines
##### (c) Program-registered providers

(1) Defined

In this section, except as otherwise provided, the term “program-registered provider” means, with respect to a State, any health care provider that

(A) is licensed or otherwise authorized for administration of pediatric vaccines under the law of the State in which the administration occurs (subject to section 254f(e) of this title ), without regard to whether or not the provider participates in the plan under this subchapter;

(B) submits to the State an executed provider agreement described in paragraph (2); and

(C) has not been found, by the Secretary or the State, to have violated such agreement or other applicable requirements established by the Secretary or the State consistent with this section.

(2) Provider agreement

A provider agreement for a provider under this paragraph is an agreement (in such form and manner as the Secretary may require) that the provider agrees as follows:

(A)

(i) Before administering a qualified pediatric vaccine to a child, the provider will ask a parent of the child such questions as are necessary to determine whether the child is a vaccine-eligible child, but the provider need not independently verify the answers to such questions.

(ii) The provider will, for a period of time specified by the Secretary, maintain records of responses made to the questions.

(iii) The provider will, upon request, make such records available to the State and to the Secretary, subject to section 1396a(a)(7) of this title .

(B)

(i) Subject to clause (ii), the provider will comply with the schedule, regarding the appropriate periodicity, dosage, and contraindications applicable to pediatric vaccines, that is established and periodically reviewed and, as appropriate, revised by the advisory committee referred to in subsection (e), except in such cases as, in the provider’s medical judgment subject to accepted medical practice, such compliance is medically inappropriate.

(ii) The provider will provide pediatric vaccines in compliance with applicable State law, including any such law relating to any religious or other exemption.

(C)

(i) In administering a qualified pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child, the provider will not impose a charge for the cost of the vaccine. A program-registered provider is not required under this section to administer such a vaccine to each child for whom an immunization with the vaccine is sought from the provider.

(ii) The provider may impose a fee for the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine so long as the fee in the case of a federally vaccine-eligible child does not exceed the costs of such administration (as determined by the Secretary based on actual regional costs for such administration).

(iii) The provider will not deny administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child due to the inability of the child’s parent to pay an administration fee.

(3) Encouraging involvement of providers

Each program under this section shall provide, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary

(A) for encouraging the following to become program-registered providers: private health care providers, the Indian Health Service, health care providers that receive funds under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act [ 25 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.], and health programs or facilities operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations; and

(B) for identifying, with respect to any population of vaccine-eligible children a substantial portion of whose parents have a limited ability to speak the English language, those program-registered providers who are able to communicate with the population involved in the language and cultural context that is most appropriate.

(4) State requirements

Except as the Secretary may permit in order to prevent fraud and abuse and for related purposes, a State may not impose additional qualifications or conditions, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), in order that a provider qualify as a program-registered provider under this section. This subsection does not limit the exercise of State authority under section 1396n(b) of this title .
