##### (f) Underground transmission and distribution lines

In carrying out the program under subsection (a), the Secretary shall support research and development on underground transmission and distribution lines. This shall include research on

(1) methods for lowering the costs of underground transmission and distribution lines, including through novel installation techniques and materials considerations;

(2) techniques to improve the lifespan of underground transmission and distribution lines;

(3) wireless sensors to improve safety of underground transmission and distribution lines and to predict, identify, detect, and transmit information about degradation and faults; and

(4) methods for improving the resilience and reliability of underground transmission and distribution lines, including technologies and techniques that can mitigate the impact of flooding, storm surge, and seasonal climate cycles on degradation of and damage to underground transmission and distribution lines.
