### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300e–7. General provisions relating to loan guarantees and loans
##### (a) Conditions

(1) The Secretary may not approve an application for a loan guarantee under this subchapter unless he determines that (A) the terms, conditions, security (if any), and schedule and amount of repayments with respect to the loan are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and are otherwise reasonable, including a determination that the rate of interest does not exceed such per centum per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for loans with similar maturities, terms, conditions, and security and the risks assumed by the United States, and (B) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and conditions without the guarantee under this subchapter.

(2)

(A) The United States shall be entitled to recover from the applicant for a loan guarantee under this subchapter the amount of any payment made pursuant to such guarantee, unless the Secretary for good cause waives such right of recovery; and, upon making any such payment, the United States shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the recipient of the payments with respect to which the guarantee was made.

(B) To the extent permitted by subparagraph (C), any terms and conditions applicable to a loan guarantee under this subchapter (including terms and conditions imposed under subparagraph (D)) may be modified by the Secretary to the extent he determines it to be consistent with the financial interest of the United States.

(C) Any loan guarantee made by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be incontestable (i) in the hands of an applicant on whose behalf such guarantee is made unless the applicant engaged in fraud or misrepresentation in securing such guarantee, and (ii) as to any person (or his successor in interest) who makes or contracts to make a loan to such applicant in reliance thereon unless such person (or his successor in interest) engaged in fraud or misrepresentation in making or contracting to make such loan.

(D) Guarantees of loans under this subchapter shall be subject to such further terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be necessary to assure that the purposes of this subchapter will be achieved.
