(2) the State plan has been so changed that it no longer complies substantially with the provisions of subsection (a), or

(3) in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with any such provision of subsection (a), the Assistant Secretary shall notify such State agency that no further payments from its allotments under section 3024 of this title and section 3028 of this title will be made to the State (or, in the Assistant Secretary’s discretion, that further payments to the State will be limited to projects under or portions of the State plan not affected by such failure), until the Assistant Secretary is satisfied that there will no longer be any failure to comply.

Any such payment shall be matched in the proportions specified in section 3024 of this title .
