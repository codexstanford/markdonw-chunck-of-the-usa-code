Required Efficiency

(decimal equivalent of a percentage)

Less than 1 watt

0.5 times the Nameplate Output

From 1 watt to not more than 51 watts

The sum of 0.09 times the Natural Logarithm of the Nameplate Output and 0.5

Greater than 51 watts

0.85

No-Load Mode

Nameplate Output

Maximum Consumption

Not more than 250 watts

0.5 watts

(B) Noncovered supplies .

A class A external power supply shall not be subject to subparagraph (A) if the class A external power supply is

(i) manufactured during the period beginning on July 1, 2008 , and ending on June 30, 2015 ; and

(ii) made available by the manufacturer as a service part or a spare part for an end-use product

(I) that constitutes the primary load; and

(II) was manufactured before July 1, 2008 .

(C) Marking .

Any class A external power supply manufactured on or after the later of July 1, 2008 or December 19, 2007 , shall be clearly and permanently marked in accordance with the External Power Supply International Efficiency Marking Protocol, as referenced in the “Energy Star Program Requirements for Single Voltage External AC–DC and AC–AC Power Supplies, version 1.1” published by the Environmental Protection Agency.

(D) Amendment of standards.

(i) Final rule by july 1, 2011 .

(I) In general .

Not later than July 1, 2011 , the Secretary shall publish a final rule to determine whether the standards established under subparagraph (A) should be amended.

(II) Administration .

The final rule shall

(aa) contain any amended standards; and

(bb) apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2013 .

(ii) Final rule by july 1, 2021 .

(I) In general .

Not later than July 1, 2021 the Secretary shall publish a final rule to determine whether the standards then in effect should be amended.

(II) Administration .

The final rule shall

(aa) contain any amended standards; and

(bb) apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023 .

(E) Nonapplication of no-load mode energy efficiency standards to external power supplies for certain security or life safety alarms or surveillance systems.

(i) Definition of security or life safety alarm or surveillance system .

In this subparagraph:

(I) In general .

The term “security or life safety alarm or surveillance system” means equipment designed and marketed to perform any of the following functions (on a continuous basis):

(aa) Monitor, detect, record, or provide notification of intrusion or access to real property or physical assets or notification of threats to life safety.

(bb) Deter or control access to real property or physical assets, or prevent the unauthorized removal of physical assets.

(cc) Monitor, detect, record, or provide notification of fire, gas, smoke, flooding, or other physical threats to real property, physical assets, or life safety.

(II) Exclusion .

The term “security or life safety alarm or surveillance system” does not include any product with a principal function other than life safety, security, or surveillance that

(aa) is designed and marketed with a built-in alarm or theft-deterrent feature; or

(bb) does not operate necessarily and continuously in active mode.

(ii) Nonapplication of no-load mode requirements .

The No-Load Mode energy efficiency standards established by this paragraph shall not apply to an external power supply manufactured before the effective date of the amendment under subparagraph (D)(ii) that

(I) is an AC-to-AC external power supply;

(II) has a nameplate output of 20 watts or more;

(III) is certified to the Secretary as being designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system component; and

(IV) on establishment within the External Power Supply International Efficiency Marking Protocol, as referenced in the “Energy Star Program Requirements for Single Voltage External Ac–Dc and Ac–Ac Power Supplies”, published by the Environmental Protection Agency, of a distinguishing mark for products described in this clause, is permanently marked with the distinguishing mark.

(iii) Administration .

In carrying out this subparagraph, the Secretary shall

(I) require, with appropriate safeguard for the protection of confidential business information, the submission of unit shipment data on an annual basis; and

(II) restrict the eligibility of external power supplies for the exemption provided under this subparagraph on a finding that a substantial number of the external power supplies are being marketed to or installed in applications other than security or life safety alarm or surveillance systems.

(iv) Treatment in rule .

In the rule under subparagraph (D)(ii) and subsequent amendments the Secretary may treat some or all external power supplies designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system as a separate product class or may extend the nonapplication under clause (ii).

(4) End-use products .

An energy conservation standard for external power supplies shall not constitute an energy conservation standard for the separate end-use product to which the external power supply is connected.

(5) Exempt supplies.

(A) February 10, 2014 , rule.

(i) In general .

An external power supply shall not be subject to the final rule entitled “Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for External Power Supplies”, published at 79 Fed. Reg. 7845 ( February 10, 2014 ), if the external power supply

(I) is manufactured during the period beginning on February 10, 2016 , and ending on February 10, 2020 ;

(II) is marked in accordance with the External Power Supply International Efficiency Marking Protocol, as in effect on February 10, 2016 ;

(III) meets, where applicable, the standards under paragraph (3)(A), and has been certified to the Secretary as meeting International Efficiency Level IV or higher of the External Power Supply International Efficiency Marking Protocol, as in effect on February 10, 2016 ; and

(IV) is made available by the manufacturer as a service part or a spare part for an end-use product that

(aa) constitutes the primary load; and

(bb) was manufactured before February 10, 2016 .

(ii) Reporting .

The Secretary may require manufacturers of products exempted pursuant to clause (i) to report annual total units shipped as service and spare parts that fall below International Efficiency Level VI.

(iii) Limitation of exemption .

The Secretary may issue a rule, after providing public notice and opportunity for public comment, to limit the applicability of the exemption established under clause (i) if the Secretary determines that the exemption is resulting in a significant reduction of the energy savings that would otherwise result from the final rule described in such clause.

(B) Amended standards.

(i) In general .

The Secretary may exempt an external power supply from any amended standard under this subsection if the external power supply

(I) is manufactured within four years of the compliance date of the amended standard;

(II) complies with applicable marking requirements adopted by the Secretary prior to the amendment;

(III) meets the standards that were in effect prior to the amendment; and

(IV) is made available by the manufacturer as a service part or a spare part for an end-use product that

(aa) constitutes the primary load; and

(bb) was manufactured before the compliance date of the amended standard.

(ii) Reporting .

The Secretary may require manufacturers of a product exempted pursuant to clause (i) to report annual total units shipped as service and spare parts that do not meet the amended standard.
