### CHAPTER 162— ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE
#### § 18751. Infrastructure planning for micro and small modular nuclear reactors
##### (c) Elements

The report required by subsection (b) shall address the following:

(1) An evaluation by the Department of current resilience and carbon reduction requirements for energy for facilities of the Department to determine whether changes are needed to address

(A) the need to provide uninterrupted power to facilities of the Department for at least 3 days during power grid failures;

(B) the need for protection against cyber threats and electromagnetic pulses; and

(C) resilience to extreme natural events, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, tornados, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, lahars, landslides, seiches, a large quantity of snowfall, and very low or high temperatures.

(2) A strategy of the Department for using nuclear energy to meet resilience and carbon reduction goals of facilities of the Department.

(3) A strategy to partner with private industry to develop and deploy micro-reactors and small modular reactors to remote communities in order to replace diesel generation and other fossil fuels.

(4) An assessment by the Department of the value associated with enhancing the resilience of a facility of the Department by transitioning to power from micro-reactors and small modular reactors and to co-located nuclear facilities with the capability to provide dedicated power to the facility of the Department during a grid outage or failure.

(5) The plans of the Department

(A) for deploying a micro-reactor and a small modular reactor to produce energy for use by a facility of the Department in the United States by 2026;

(B) for deploying a small modular reactor to produce energy for use by a facility of the Department in the United States by 2029; and

(C) to include micro-reactors and small modular reactors in the planning for meeting future facility energy needs.
