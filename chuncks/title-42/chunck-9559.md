#### § 1587. Disposition of other permanent war housing
##### (b) Preference in sales to individuals

Preference in the purchase of any dwelling structure designed for occupancy by not more than four families and offered for separate sale shall be granted to occupants and to veterans over other prospective purchasers for such period as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may determine and in the following order:

(1) a veteran who occupies a unit in the dwelling structure to be sold and who intends to continue to occupy such unit;

(2) a nonveteran who occupies a unit in the dwelling structure to be sold and who intends to continue to occupy such unit;

(3) a veteran who intends to occupy a unit in the dwelling structure to be sold. Subject to the above order of preference, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may establish subordinate preferences for any such dwelling structure. In the disposition of any dwellings under this section which were acquired by the United States from persons occupying the dwellings at the time of such acquisition, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, notwithstanding the order of preference provided in this section, grant a first preference to such persons in the purchase of any of these dwellings for such period and under such conditions as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate and in the public interest. As used in this subsection, the term “veteran” shall include a veteran, a serviceman, or the family of a veteran or a serviceman, or the family of a deceased veteran or serviceman whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected.
