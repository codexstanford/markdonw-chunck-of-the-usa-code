#### § 8451. National coal policy study
##### (a) Study

The President, acting through the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall make a full and complete investigation and study of the alternative national uses of coal available in the United States to meet the Nation’s energy requirements consistent with national policies for the protection and enhancement of the quality of the environment and for economic recovery and full employment. In particular the study should identify and evaluate

(1) current and prospective coal requirements of the United States;

(2) current and prospective voluntary and mandatory energy conservation measures and their potential for reduction of the United States coal requirements;

(3) current and prospective coal resource production, transportation, conversion, and utilization requirements;

(4) the extent and adequacy of coal research, development, and demonstration programs being carried out by Federal, State, local, and nongovernmental entities (including financial resources, manpower, and statutory authority);

(5) programs for the development of coal mining technologies which increase coal production and utilization while protecting the health and safety of coal miners;

(6) alternative strategies for meeting anticipated United States coal requirements, consistent with achieving other national goals, including national security and environmental protection;

(7) existing and prospective governmental policies and laws affecting the coal industry with the view of determining what, if any, changes in and implementation of such policies and laws may be advisable in order to consolidate, coordinate, and provide an effective and equitable national energy policy consistent with other national policies; and

(8) the most efficient use of the Nation’s coal resources considering economic (including capital and consumer costs, and balance of payments), social (including employment), environmental, technological, national defense, and other aspects.
