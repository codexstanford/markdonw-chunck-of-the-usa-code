#### § 8013. Supportive housing for persons with disabilities
##### (h) Development cost limitations

(1) Group homes

The Secretary shall periodically establish development cost limitations by market area for group homes of supportive housing for persons with disabilities by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect

(A) the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of supportive housing for persons with disabilities that (i) meets applicable State and local housing and building codes; and (ii) conforms with the design characteristics of the neighborhood in which it is to be located;

(B) the cost of movables necessary to the basic operation of the housing, as determined by the Secretary;

(C) the cost of special design features necessary to make the housing accessible to persons with disabilities;

(D) the cost of special design features necessary to make individual dwelling units meet the special needs of persons with disabilities;

(E) if the housing is newly constructed, the cost of meeting the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of this title ; and

(F) the cost of land, including necessary site improvement. In establishing development cost limitations for a given market area, the Secretary shall use data that reflect currently prevailing costs of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, and land acquisition in the area. Neither this section nor any other provision of law may be construed as prohibiting or preventing the location and operation, in a project assisted under this section, of commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and the community in which the project is located, except that assistance made available under this section may not be used to subsidize any such commercial facility.

(2) RTC properties

In the case of existing housing and related facilities from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c)  2 of title 12, the cost limitations shall include

(A) the cost of acquiring such housing,

(B) the cost of rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, or improvement, including the moderate rehabilitation thereof, and

(C) the cost of the land on which the housing and related facilities are located.

(3) Annual adjustments

The Secretary shall adjust the cost limitation established pursuant to paragraph (1) not less than once annually to reflect changes in the general level of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation costs.

(4) Incentives for savings

(A) Special project account

The Secretary shall use the development cost limitations established under paragraph (1) to calculate the amount of financing to be made available to individual owners. Owners which incur actual development costs that are less than the amount of financing shall be entitled to retain 50 percent of the savings in a special project account. Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for owners which add energy efficiency features which (i) exceed the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of this title ; (ii) substantially reduce the life-cycle cost of the housing; (iii) reduce gross rent requirements; and (iv) enhance tenant comfort and convenience.

(B) Uses

The special project account established under subparagraph (A) may be used (i) to supplement services provided to residents of the housing or funds set-aside for replacement reserves, or (ii) for such other purposes as determined by the Secretary.

(5) Funds from other sources

An owner shall be permitted voluntarily to provide funds from sources other than this section for amenities and other features of appropriate design and construction suitable for supportive housing for persons with disabilities if the cost of such amenities is (A) not financed with the advance, and (B) is not taken into account in determining the amount of Federal assistance or of the rent contribution of tenants. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, assistance amounts provided under this section may be treated as amounts not derived from a Federal grant.

(6) Applicability of home program cost limitations

(A) In general

The provisions of section 212(e) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act ( 42 U.S.C. 12742(e) ) and the cost limits established by the Secretary pursuant to such section with respect to the amount of funds under subtitle A of title II of such Act [ 42 U.S.C. 12741 et seq.] that may be invested on a per unit basis, shall apply to supportive housing assisted with a capital advance under subsection (d)(1) and the amount of funds under such subsection that may be invested on a per unit basis.

(B) Waivers

The Secretary may provide for waiver of the cost limits applicable pursuant to subparagraph (A)

(i) in the cases in which the cost limits established pursuant to section 212(e) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act may be waived; and

(ii) to provide for

(I) the cost of special design features to make the housing accessible to persons with disabilities;

(II) the cost of special design features necessary to make individual dwelling units meet the special needs of persons with disabilities; and

(III) the cost of providing the housing in a location that is accessible to public transportation and community organizations that provide supportive services to persons with disabilities.
