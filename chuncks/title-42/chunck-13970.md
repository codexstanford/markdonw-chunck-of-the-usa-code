#### § 5413. Inspections and investigations for promulgation or enforcement of standards or execution of other duties
##### (c) Powers of Secretary

For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized

(1) to hold such hearings, take such testimony, sit and act at such times and places, administer such oaths, and require, by subpena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and the production of such books, papers, correspondence, memorandums, contracts, agreements, or other records, as the Secretary or such officer or employee deems advisable. Witnesses summoned pursuant to this subsection shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States;

(2) to examine and copy any documentary evidence of any person having materials or information relevant to any function of the Secretary under this chapter;

(3) to require, by general or special orders, any person to file, in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, reports or answers in writing to specific questions relating to any function of the Secretary under this chapter. Such reports and answers shall be made under oath or otherwise, and shall be filed with the Secretary within such reasonable period as the Secretary may prescribe;

(4) to request from any Federal agency any information he deems necessary to carry out his functions under this chapter, and each such agency is authorized and directed to cooperate with the Secretary and to furnish such information upon request made by the Secretary, and the head of any Federal agency is authorized to detail, on a reimbursable basis, any personnel of such agency to assist in carrying out the duties of the Secretary under this chapter; and

(5) to make available to the public any information which may indicate the existence of a defect which relates to manufactured home construction or safety or of the failure of a manufactured home to comply with applicable manufactured home construction and safety standards. The Secretary shall disclose so much of other information obtained under this subsection to the public as he determines will assist in carrying out this chapter; but he shall not (under the authority of this sentence) make available or disclosure to the public any information which contains or relates to a trade secret or any information the disclosure of which would put the person furnishing such information at a substantial competitive disadvantage, unless he determines that it is necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter.
