#### § 13257. Fleet requirement program
##### (e) Determination

(1) Not later than January 1, 2000 , the Secretary shall, through the rule required under subsection (g), determine whether a fleet requirement program is necessary under this section. Such a program shall be considered necessary and a rule therefor shall be promulgated if the Secretary finds that

(A) the goal of replacement fuel use described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title , is not expected to be actually achieved by 2010, or such other date as is established under section 13254 of this title , by voluntary means or pursuant to this subchapter or any other law without such a fleet requirement program, taking into consideration the status of the achievement of the interim goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(A) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title ; and

(B) such goal is practicable and actually achievable within periods specified in section 13252(b)(2) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title , through implementation of such a fleet requirement program in combination with voluntary means and the application of other programs relevant to achieving such goals.

(2) The rule under subsection (b) or (g) shall also modify the goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title and establish a revised goal pursuant to section 13254 of this title if the Secretary determines, based on the proceeding required under subsection (a) or (c), that the goal in effect at the time of that proceeding is inadequate or impracticable, and not expected to be achievable. Such goal as modified and established shall be applicable in making the findings described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary modifies the goal under this paragraph, he may also modify the percentages stated in subsection (a)(1) or (g)(1) and the minimum percentage stated in subsection (a)(2) or (g)(2) shall be not less than 10 percent.
