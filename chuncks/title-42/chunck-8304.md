#### § 1396a. State plans for medical assistance
##### (ee) Alternate State process for verification of citizenship or nationality declaration
######## (B) If, for any fiscal year, the average monthly percentage determined under subparagraph (A) is greater than 3 percent

(i) the State shall develop and adopt a corrective plan to review its procedures for verifying the identities of individuals seeking to enroll in the State plan under this subchapter and to identify and implement changes in such procedures to improve their accuracy; and

(ii) pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount which bears the same ratio to the total payments under the State plan for the fiscal year for providing medical assistance to individuals who provided inconsistent information as the number of individuals with inconsistent information in excess of 3 percent of such total submitted bears to the total number of individuals with inconsistent information.

(C) The Secretary may waive, in certain limited cases, all or part of the payment under subparagraph (B)(ii) if the State is unable to reach the allowable error rate despite a good faith effort by such State.

(D) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to a State for a fiscal year if there is an agreement described in paragraph (2)(B) in effect as of the close of the fiscal year that provides for the submission on a real-time basis of the information described in such paragraph.

(4) Nothing in this subsection shall affect the rights of any individual under this subchapter to appeal any disenrollment from a State plan.
