### CHAPTER 61— UNIFORM RELOCATION ASSISTANCE AND REAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION POLICIES FOR FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS
#### § 4621. Declaration of findings and policy
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds and declares that

(1) displacement as a direct result of programs or projects undertaken by a Federal agency or with Federal financial assistance is caused by a number of activities, including rehabilitation, demolition, code enforcement, and acquisition;

(2) relocation assistance policies must provide for fair, uniform, and equitable treatment of all affected persons;

(3) the displacement of businesses often results in their closure;

(4) minimizing the adverse impact of displacement is essential to maintaining the economic and social well-being of communities; and

(5) implementation of this chapter has resulted in burdensome, inefficient, and inconsistent compliance requirements and procedures which will be improved by establishing a lead agency and allowing for State certification and implementation.
