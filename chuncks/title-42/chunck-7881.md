##### (h) Prior determination process for certain items and services

(1) Establishment of process

(A) In general

With respect to a medicare administrative contractor that has a contract under section 1395kk–1 of this title that provides for making payments under this subchapter with respect to physicians’ services (as defined in section 1395w–4(j)(3) of this title ), the Secretary shall establish a prior determination process that meets the requirements of this subsection and that shall be applied by such contractor in the case of eligible requesters.

(B) Eligible requester

For purposes of this subsection, each of the following shall be an eligible requester:

(i) A participating physician, but only with respect to physicians’ services to be furnished to an individual who is entitled to benefits under this subchapter and who has consented to the physician making the request under this subsection for those physicians’ services.

(ii) An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter, but only with respect to a physicians’ service for which the individual receives, from a physician, an advance beneficiary notice under section 1395pp(a) of this title .

(2) Secretarial flexibility

The Secretary shall establish by regulation reasonable limits on the physicians’ services for which a prior determination of coverage may be requested under this subsection. In establishing such limits, the Secretary may consider the dollar amount involved with respect to the physicians’ service, administrative costs and burdens, and other relevant factors.

(3) Request for prior determination

(A) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), under the process established under this subsection an eligible requester may submit to the contractor a request for a determination, before the furnishing of a physicians’ service, as to whether the physicians’ service is covered under this subchapter consistent with the applicable requirements of section 1395y(a)(1)(A) of this title (relating to medical necessity).

(B) Accompanying documentation

The Secretary may require that the request be accompanied by a description of the physicians’ service, supporting documentation relating to the medical necessity for the physicians’ service, and any other appropriate documentation. In the case of a request submitted by an eligible requester who is described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the Secretary may require that the request also be accompanied by a copy of the advance beneficiary notice involved.

(4) Response to request

(A) In general

Under such process, the contractor shall provide the eligible requester with written notice of a determination as to whether

(i) the physicians’ service is so covered;

(ii) the physicians’ service is not so covered; or

(iii) the contractor lacks sufficient information to make a coverage determination with respect to the physicians’ service.

(B) Contents of notice for certain determinations

(i) Noncoverage

If the contractor makes the determination described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the contractor shall include in the notice a brief explanation of the basis for the determination, including on what national or local coverage or noncoverage determination (if any) the determination is based, and a description of any applicable rights under subsection (a).

(ii) Insufficient information

If the contractor makes the determination described in subparagraph (A)(iii), the contractor shall include in the notice a description of the additional information required to make the coverage determination.

(C) Deadline to respond

Such notice shall be provided within the same time period as the time period applicable to the contractor providing notice of initial determinations on a claim for benefits under subsection (a)(2)(A).

(D) Informing beneficiary in case of physician request

In the case of a request by a participating physician under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the process shall provide that the individual to whom the physicians’ service is proposed to be furnished shall be informed of any determination described in subparagraph (A)(ii) (relating to a determination of non-coverage) and the right (referred to in paragraph (6)(B)) to obtain the physicians’ service and have a claim submitted for the physicians’ service.

(5) Binding nature of positive determination

If the contractor makes the determination described in paragraph (4)(A)(i), such determination shall be binding on the contractor in the absence of fraud or evidence of misrepresentation of facts presented to the contractor.

(6) Limitation on further review

(A) In general

Contractor determinations described in paragraph (4)(A)(ii) or (4)(A)(iii) (relating to pre-service claims) are not subject to further administrative appeal or judicial review under this section or otherwise.

(B) Decision not to seek prior determination or negative determination does not impact right to obtain services, seek reimbursement, or appeal rights

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting the right of an individual who

(i) decides not to seek a prior determination under this subsection with respect to physicians’ services; or

(ii) seeks such a determination and has received a determination described in paragraph (4)(A)(ii), from receiving (and submitting a claim for) such physicians’ services and from obtaining administrative or judicial review respecting such claim under the other applicable provisions of this section. Failure to seek a prior determination under this subsection with respect to physicians’ service shall not be taken into account in such administrative or judicial review.

(C) No prior determination after receipt of services

Once an individual is provided physicians’ services, there shall be no prior determination under this subsection with respect to such physicians’ services.
