### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 263a. Certification of laboratories
##### (i) Suspension, revocation, and limitation

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the certificate of a laboratory issued under this section may be suspended, revoked, or limited if the Secretary finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the owner or operator of the laboratory, that such owner or operator or any employee of the laboratory

(A) has been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining the certificate,

(B) has performed or represented the laboratory as entitled to perform a laboratory examination or other procedure which is not within a category of laboratory examinations or other procedures authorized in the certificate,

(C) has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (d) or the standards prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (f),

(D) has failed to comply with reasonable requests of the Secretary for

(i) any information or materials, or

(ii) work on materials, that the Secretary concludes is necessary to determine the laboratory’s continued eligibility for its certificate or continued compliance with the Secretary’s standards under subsection (f),

(E) has refused a reasonable request of the Secretary, or any Federal officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, for permission to inspect the laboratory and its operations and pertinent records during the hours the laboratory is in operation,

(F) has violated or aided and abetted in the violation of any provisions of this section or of any regulation promulgated thereunder, or

(G) has not complied with an intermediate sanction imposed under subsection (h).

(2) Action before a hearing

If the Secretary determines that

(A) the failure of a laboratory to comply with the standards of the Secretary under subsection (f) presents an imminent and serious risk to human health, or

(B) a laboratory has engaged in an action described in subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph (1), the Secretary may suspend or limit the certificate of the laboratory before holding a hearing under paragraph (1) regarding such failure or refusal. The opportunity for a hearing shall be provided no later than 60 days from the effective date of the suspension or limitation. A suspension or limitation under this paragraph shall stay in effect until the decision of the Secretary made after the hearing under paragraph (1).

(3) Ineligibility to own or operate laboratories after revocation

No person who has owned or operated a laboratory which has had its certificate revoked may, within 2 years of the revocation of the certificate, own or operate a laboratory for which a certificate has been issued under this section, except that if the revocation occurs pursuant to paragraph (4) the Secretary may substitute intermediate sanctions under subsection (h) instead of the 2-year prohibition against ownership or operation which would otherwise apply under this paragraph. The certificate of a laboratory which has been excluded from participation under the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] because of actions relating to the quality of the laboratory shall be suspended for the period the laboratory is so excluded.

(4) Improper referrals

Any laboratory that the Secretary determines intentionally refers its proficiency testing samples to another laboratory for analysis may have its certificate revoked for at least one year and shall be subject to appropriate fines and penalties as provided for in subsection (h).
