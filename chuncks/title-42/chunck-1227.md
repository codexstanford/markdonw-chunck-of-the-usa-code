##### (a) Establishment

The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall by one or more contracts establish and maintain a C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (referred to in this section as the “Program”), successor to the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry, that has the purpose of increasing the number of transplants for recipients suitably matched to biologically unrelated donors of bone marrow and cord blood, and that meets the requirements of this section. The Secretary may award a separate contract to perform each of the major functions of the Program described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d) if deemed necessary by the Secretary to operate an effective and efficient system that is in the best interest of patients. The Secretary shall conduct a separate competition for the initial establishment of the cord blood functions of the Program. The Program shall be under the general supervision of the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish an Advisory Council to advise, assist, consult with, and make recommendations to the Secretary on matters related to the activities carried out by the Program. The members of the Advisory Council shall be appointed in accordance with the following:

(1) Each member of the Advisory Council shall serve for a term of 2 years, and each such member may serve as many as 3 consecutive 2-year terms, except that

(A) such limitations shall not apply to the Chair of the Advisory Council (or the Chair-elect) or to the member of the Advisory Council who most recently served as the Chair; and

(B) one additional consecutive 2-year term may be served by any member of the Advisory Council who has no employment, governance, or financial affiliation with any donor center, recruitment organization, transplant center, or cord blood bank.

(2) A member of the Advisory Council may continue to serve after the expiration of the term of such member until a successor is appointed.

(3) In order to ensure the continuity of the Advisory Council, the Advisory Council shall be appointed so that each year the terms of approximately one-third of the members of the Advisory Council expire.

(4) The membership of the Advisory Council

(A) shall include as voting members a balanced number of representatives including representatives of marrow donor centers and marrow transplant centers, representatives of cord blood banks and participating birthing hospitals, recipients of a bone marrow transplant, recipients of a cord blood transplant, persons who require such transplants, family members of such a recipient or family members of a patient who has requested the assistance of the Program in searching for an unrelated donor of bone marrow or cord blood, persons with expertise in bone marrow and cord blood transplantation, persons with expertise in typing, matching, and transplant outcome data analysis, persons with expertise in the social sciences, basic scientists with expertise in the biology of adult stem cells, and members of the general public; and

(B) shall include as nonvoting members representatives from the Department of Defense Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program operated by the Department of the Navy, the Division of Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health.

(5) Members of the Advisory Council shall be chosen so as to ensure objectivity and balance and reduce the potential for conflicts of interest. The Secretary shall establish bylaws and procedures

(A) to prohibit any member of the Advisory Council who has an employment, governance, or financial affiliation with a donor center, recruitment organization, transplant center, or cord blood bank from participating in any decision that materially affects the center, recruitment organization, transplant center, or cord blood bank; and

(B) to limit the number of members of the Advisory Council with any such affiliation.

(6) The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall submit to Congress an annual report on the activities carried out under this section.
