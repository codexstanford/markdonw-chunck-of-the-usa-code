#### § 5001. Grants and contracts for volunteer service projects
##### (i) Temporary continuation of programs that fail to meet performance measures

(1) Notwithstanding subsection (g)(3) or section 5052 of this title , the Corporation shall continue to fund a program assisted under this section that has failed to meet or exceed the performance measures, outcomes, and other criteria established under this subsection for not more than 12 months if the competitive process established under subsection (e) does not result in a successor grant or contract for such program, in order to minimize the disruption to volunteers and the disruption of services.

(2) In the case where a program is continued under paragraph (1), the Corporation shall conduct outreach regarding the availability of a grant under this section for the area served by such program and establish a new competition for awarding the successor program to the continued program. The recipient operating the continued program shall remain eligible for the new competition.

(3) The Corporation may monitor the recipient of a grant or contract supporting a program continued under paragraph (1) during this period and may provide training and technical assistance to assist such recipient in meeting the performance measures for such program.
