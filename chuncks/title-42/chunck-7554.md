##### (f) Computation of applicable MA region-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amounts

(1) Computation for regions

For purposes of section 1395w–23(j)(2) of this title and this section, subject to subsection (e), the term “MA region-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount” means, with respect to an MA region for a month in a year, the sum of the 2 components described in paragraph (2) for the region and year. The Secretary shall compute such benchmark amount for each MA region before the beginning of each annual, coordinated election period under section 1395w–21(e)(3)(B) of this title for each year (beginning with 2006).

(2) 2 components

For purposes of paragraph (1), the 2 components described in this paragraph for an MA region and a year are the following:

(A) Statutory component

The product of the following:

(i) Statutory region-specific non-drug amount

The statutory region-specific non-drug amount (as defined in paragraph (3)) for the region and year.

(ii) Statutory national market share

The statutory national market share percentage, determined under paragraph (4) for the year.

(B) Plan-bid component

The product of the following:

(i) Weighted average of MA plan bids in region

The weighted average of the plan bids for the region and year (as determined under paragraph (5)(A)).

(ii) Non-statutory market share

1 minus the statutory national market share percentage, determined under paragraph (4) for the year.

(3) Statutory region-specific non-drug amount

For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(i), the term “statutory region-specific non-drug amount” means, for an MA region and year, an amount equal the sum (for each MA local area within the region) of the product of

(A) MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount under section 1395w–23(j)(1)(A) of this title for that area and year; and

(B) the number of MA eligible individuals residing in the local area, divided by the total number of MA eligible individuals residing in the region.

(4) Computation of statutory market share percentage

(A) In general

The Secretary shall determine for each year a statutory national market share percentage that is equal to the proportion of MA eligible individuals nationally who were not enrolled in an MA plan during the reference month.

(B) Reference month defined

For purposes of this part, the term “reference month” means, with respect to a year, the most recent month during the previous year for which the Secretary determines that data are available to compute the percentage specified in subparagraph (A) and other relevant percentages under this part.

(5) Determination of weighted average MA bids for a region

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (2)(B)(i), the weighted average of plan bids for an MA region and a year is the sum, for MA regional plans described in subparagraph (D) in the region and year, of the products (for each such plan) of the following:

(i) Monthly MA statutory non-drug bid amount

The unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount for the plan.

(ii) Plan’s share of MA enrollment in region

The factor described in subparagraph (B) for the plan.

(B) Plan’s share of MA enrollment in region

(i) In general

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subparagraph, the factor described in this subparagraph for a plan is equal to the number of individuals described in subparagraph (C) for such plan, divided by the total number of such individuals for all MA regional plans described in subparagraph (D) for that region and year.

(ii) Single plan rule

In the case of an MA region in which only a single MA regional plan is being offered, the factor described in this subparagraph shall be equal to 1.

(iii) Equal division among multiple plans in year in which plans are first available

In the case of an MA region in the first year in which any MA regional plan is offered, if more than one MA regional plan is offered in such year, the factor described in this subparagraph for a plan shall (as specified by the Secretary) be equal to

(I) 1 divided by the number of such plans offered in such year; or

(II) a factor for such plan that is based upon the organization’s estimate of projected enrollment, as reviewed and adjusted by the Secretary to ensure reasonableness and as is certified by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

(C) Counting of individuals

For purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the Secretary shall count for each MA regional plan described in subparagraph (D) for an MA region and year, the number of individuals who reside in the region and who were enrolled under such plan under this part during the reference month.

(D) Plans covered

For an MA region and year, an MA regional plan described in this subparagraph is an MA regional plan that is offered in the region and year and was offered in the region in the reference month.
