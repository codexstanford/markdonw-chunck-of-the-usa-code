(C) Exemptions .

The standards specified in subparagraph (B) shall not apply to the following types of incandescent reflector lamps:

(i) Lamps rated at 50 watts or less that are ER30, BR30, BR40, or ER40 lamps.

(ii) Lamps rated at 65 watts that are BR30, BR40, or ER40 lamps.

(iii) R20 incandescent reflector lamps rated 45 watts or less.

(D) Effective dates.

(i) ER, br, and bpar lamps .

The standards specified in subparagraph (B) shall apply with respect to ER incandescent reflector lamps, BR incandescent reflector lamps, BPAR incandescent reflector lamps, and similar bulb shapes on and after January 1, 2008 .

(ii) Lamps between 2.25–2.75 inches in diameter .

The standards specified in subparagraph (B) shall apply with respect to incandescent reflector lamps with a diameter of more than 2.25 inches, but not more than 2.75 inches, on and after the later of January 1, 2008 , or the date that is 180 days after December 19, 2007 .

(2) Notwithstanding section 6302(a)(5) of this title and section 6302(b) of this title , it shall not be unlawful for a manufacturer to sell a lamp which is in compliance with the law at the time such lamp was manufactured.

(3) Not less than 36 months after October 24, 1992 , the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking procedure and shall publish a final rule not later than the end of the 54-month period beginning on October 24, 1992 , to determine if the standards established under paragraph (1) should be amended. Such rule shall contain such amendment, if any, and provide that the amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after the 36-month period beginning on the date such final rule is published.

(4) Not less than eight years after October 24, 1992 , the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking procedure and shall publish a final rule not later than nine years and six months after October 24, 1992 , to determine if the standards in effect for fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps should be amended. Such rule shall contain such amendment, if any, and provide that the amendment shall apply to products manufactured on or after the 36-month period beginning on the date such final rule is published.

(5) Not later than the end of the 24-month period beginning on the date labeling requirements under section 6294(a)(2)(C)  2 of this title become effective, the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking procedure to determine if the standards in effect for fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps should be amended so that they would be applicable to additional general service fluorescent  3 and shall publish, not later than 18 months after initiating such rulemaking, a final rule including such amended standards, if any. Such rule shall provide that the amendment shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 36 months after the date such rule is published.

(6) Standards for general service lamps.

(A) Rulemaking before january 1, 2014 .

(i) In general .

Not later than January 1, 2014 , the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking procedure to determine whether

(I) standards in effect for general service lamps should be amended to establish more stringent standards than the standards specified in paragraph (1)(A); and

(II) the exemptions for certain incandescent lamps should be maintained or discontinued based, in part, on exempted lamp sales collected by the Secretary from manufacturers.

(ii) Scope .

The rulemaking

(I) shall not be limited to incandescent lamp technologies; and

(II) shall include consideration of a minimum standard of 45 lumens per watt for general service lamps.

(iii) Amended standards .

If the Secretary determines that the standards in effect for general service incandescent lamps should be amended, the Secretary shall publish a final rule not later than January 1, 2017 , with an effective date that is not earlier than 3 years after the date on which the final rule is published.

(iv) Phased-in effective dates .

The Secretary shall consider phased-in effective dates under this subparagraph after considering

(I) the impact of any amendment on manufacturers, retiring and repurposing existing equipment, stranded investments, labor contracts, workers, and raw materials; and

(II) the time needed to work with retailers and lighting designers to revise sales and marketing strategies.

(v) Backstop requirement .

If the Secretary fails to complete a rulemaking in accordance with clauses (i) through (iv) or if the final rule does not produce savings that are greater than or equal to the savings from a minimum efficacy standard of 45 lumens per watt, effective beginning January 1, 2020 , the Secretary shall prohibit the sale of any general service lamp that does not meet a minimum efficacy standard of 45 lumens per watt.

(vi) State preemption .

Neither section 6297(b) of this title nor any other provision of law shall preclude California or Nevada from adopting, effective beginning on or after January 1, 2018

(I) a final rule adopted by the Secretary in accordance with clauses (i) through (iv);

(II) if a final rule described in subclause (I) has not been adopted, the backstop requirement under clause (v); or

(B) Rulemaking before january 1, 2020 .

(i) In general .

Not later than January 1, 2020 , the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking procedure to determine whether

(II) the time needed to work with retailers and lighting designers to revise sales and marketing strategies.

(7)

(A) With respect to any lamp to which standards are applicable under this subsection or any lamp specified in section 6317 of this title , the Secretary shall inform any Federal entity proposing actions which would adversely impact the energy consumption or energy efficiency of such lamp of the energy conservation consequences of such action. It shall be the responsibility of such Federal entity to carefully consider the Secretary’s comments.

(B) Notwithstanding subsection (n)(1), the Secretary shall not be prohibited from amending any standard, by rule, to permit increased energy use or to decrease the minimum required energy efficiency of any lamp to which standards are applicable under this subsection if such action is warranted as a result of other Federal action (including restrictions on materials or processes) which would have the effect of either increasing the energy use or decreasing the energy efficiency of such product.

(8) Not later than the date on which standards established pursuant to this subsection become effective, or, with respect to high-intensity discharge lamps covered under section 6317 of this title , the effective date of standards established pursuant to such section, each manufacturer of a product to which such standards are applicable shall file with the Secretary a laboratory report certifying compliance with the applicable standard for each lamp type. Such report shall include the lumen output and wattage consumption for each lamp type as an average of measurements taken over the preceding 12-month period. With respect to lamp types which are not manufactured during the 12-month period preceding the date such standards become effective, such report shall be filed with the Secretary not later than the date which is 12 months after the date manufacturing is commenced and shall include the lumen output and wattage consumption for each such lamp type as an average of measurements taken during such 12-month period.
