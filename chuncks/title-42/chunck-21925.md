### CHAPTER 149— NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY AND PROGRAMS
#### § 16298d. Carbon removal
##### (j) Regional direct air capture hubs

(1) Definitions

In this subsection:

(A) Eligible project

The term “eligible project” means a direct air capture project or a component project of a regional direct air capture hub.

(B) Regional direct air capture hub

The term “regional direct air capture hub” means a network of direct air capture projects, potential carbon dioxide utilization off-takers, connective carbon dioxide transport infrastructure, subsurface resources, and sequestration infrastructure located within a region.

(2) Establishment of program

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish a program under which the Secretary shall provide funding for eligible projects that contribute to the development of 4 regional direct air capture hubs described in subparagraph (B).

(B) Regional direct air capture hubs

Each of the 4 regional direct air capture hubs developed under the program under subparagraph (A) shall be a regional direct air capture hub that

(i) facilitates the deployment of direct air capture projects;

(ii) has the capacity to capture and sequester, utilize, or sequester and utilize at least 1,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually from a single unit or multiple interconnected units;

(iii) demonstrates the capture, processing, delivery, and sequestration or end-use of captured carbon; and

(iv) could be developed into a regional or interregional carbon network to facilitate sequestration or carbon utilization.

(3) Selection of projects

(A) Solicitation of proposals

(i) In general

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021 , the Secretary shall solicit applications for funding for eligible projects.

(ii) Additional solicitations

The Secretary shall solicit applications for funding for eligible projects on a recurring basis after the first round of applications is received under clause (i) until all amounts appropriated to carry out this subsection are expended.

(B) Selection of projects for the development of regional direct air capture hubs

Not later than 3 years after the date of the deadline for the submission of proposals under subparagraph (A)(i), the Secretary shall select eligible projects described in paragraph (2)(A).

(C) Criteria

The Secretary shall select eligible projects under subparagraph (B) using the following criteria:

(i) Carbon intensity of local industry

To the maximum extent practicable, each eligible project shall be located in a region with

(I) existing carbon-intensive fuel production or industrial capacity; or

(II) carbon-intensive fuel production or industrial capacity that has retired or closed in the preceding 10 years.

(ii) Geographic diversity

To the maximum extent practicable, eligible projects shall contribute to the development of regional direct air capture hubs located in different regions of the United States.

(iii) Carbon potential

To the maximum extent practicable, eligible projects shall contribute to the development of regional direct air capture hubs located in regions with high potential for carbon sequestration or utilization.

(iv) Hubs in fossil-producing regions

To the maximum extent practicable, eligible projects shall contribute to the development of at least 2 regional direct air capture hubs located in economically distressed communities in the regions of the United States with high levels of coal, oil, or natural gas resources.

(v) Scalability

The Secretary shall give priority to eligible projects that, as compared to other eligible projects, will contribute to the development of regional direct air capture hubs with larger initial capacity, greater potential for expansion, and lower levelized cost per ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere.

(vi) Employment

The Secretary shall give priority to eligible projects that are likely to create opportunities for skilled training and long-term employment to the greatest number of residents of the region.

(vii) Additional criteria

The Secretary may take into consideration other criteria that, in the judgment of the Secretary, are necessary or appropriate to carry out this subsection.

(D) Coordination

To the maximum extent practicable, in carrying out the program under this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account and coordinate with activities of the carbon capture technology program established under section 16292(b)(1) of this title , the carbon storage validation and testing program established under section 16293(b)(1) of this title , and the CIFIA program established under section 16372(a) of this title such that funding from each of the programs is leveraged to contribute toward the development of integrated regional and interregional carbon capture, removal, transport, sequestration, and utilization networks.

(E) Funding of eligible projects

The Secretary may make grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with, each eligible project selected under subparagraph (B) to accelerate commercialization of, and demonstrate the removal, processing, transport, sequestration, and utilization of, carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere.

(4) Authorization of appropriations

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this subsection $3,500,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, to remain available until expended.
