#### § 17392. Micro-grid and integrated micro-grid systems program
##### (b) Program

(1) Establishment

The Secretary of Energy (in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) shall establish a program to promote the development of

(A) integrated micro-grid systems for isolated communities; and

(B) micro-grid systems to increase the resilience of critical infrastructure.

(2) Requirements

The program established under paragraph (1) shall

(A) develop a feasibility assessment for

(i) integrated micro-grid systems in isolated communities; and

(ii) micro-grid systems to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure;

(B) develop an implementation strategy, in accordance with paragraph (3), to promote the development of integrated micro-grid systems for isolated communities, particularly for those communities exposed to extreme weather conditions and high energy costs, including electricity, space heating and cooling, and transportation;

(C) develop an implementation strategy to promote the development of micro-grid systems that increase the resilience of critical infrastructure; and

(D) carry out cost-shared demonstration projects, based upon the strategies developed under subparagraph (B) that include the development of physical and cybersecurity plans to take appropriate measures to protect and secure the electric grid.

(3) Requirements for strategy

In developing the strategy under paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall consider

(A) opportunities for improving the efficiency of existing integrated micro-grid systems;

(B) the capacity of the local workforce to operate, maintain, and repair a integrated micro-grid system as well as opportunities to improve that capacity;

(C) leveraging existing capacity within local or regional research organizations, such as organizations based at institutions of higher education, to support development of integrated micro-grid systems, including by testing novel components and systems prior to field deployment;

(D) the need for basic infrastructure to develop, deploy, and sustain a integrated micro-grid system;

(E) input of traditional knowledge from local leaders of isolated communities in the development of a integrated micro-grid system;

(F) the impact of integrated micro-grid systems on defense, homeland security, economic development, and environmental interests;

(G) opportunities to leverage existing interagency coordination efforts and recommendations for new interagency coordination efforts to minimize unnecessary overhead, mobilization, and other project costs; and

(H) any other criteria the Secretary determines appropriate.
