#### § 1395f. Conditions of and limitations on payment for services
##### (d) Payments for emergency hospital services

(1) Payments shall also be made to any hospital for inpatient hospital services furnished in a calendar year, by the hospital or under arrangements (as defined in section 1395x(w) of this title ) with it, to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title even though such hospital does not have an agreement in effect under this subchapter if (A) such services were emergency services, (B) the Secretary would be required to make such payment if the hospital had such an agreement in effect and otherwise met the conditions of payment hereunder, and (C) such hospital has elected to claim payments for all such inpatient emergency services and for the emergency outpatient services referred to in section 1395n(b) of this title furnished during such year. Such payments shall be made only in the amounts provided under subsection (b) and then only if such hospital agrees to comply, with respect to the emergency services provided, with the provisions of section 1395cc(a) of this title .

(2) Payment may be made on the basis of an itemized bill to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title for services described in paragraph (1) which are emergency services if (A) payment cannot be made under paragraph (1) solely because the hospital does not elect to claim such payment, and (B) such individual files application (submitted within such time and in such form and manner and by such person, and containing and supported by such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) for reimbursement.

(3) The amounts payable under the preceding paragraph with respect to services described therein shall, subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title , be equal to 60 percent of the hospital’s reasonable charges for routine services furnished in the accommodations occupied by the individual or in semiprivate accommodations (as defined in section 1395x(v)(4) of this title ), whichever is less, plus 80 percent of the hospital’s reasonable charges for ancillary services. If separate charges for routine and ancillary services are not made by the hospital, reimbursement may be based on two-thirds of the hospital’s reasonable charges for the services received but not to exceed the charges which would have been made if the patient had occupied semiprivate accommodations. For purposes of the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the term “routine services” shall mean the regular room, dietary, and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies and the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made; the term “ancillary services” shall mean those special services for which charges are customarily made in addition to routine services.
