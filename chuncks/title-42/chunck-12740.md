#### § 4057. Alternative loss allocation system for indeterminate claims
##### (b) Establishment of flood loss allocation formula for indeterminate claims

(1) In general

Not later than 180 days after the date on which the protocol is established under section 3611(c)(1) of title 33 , the Secretary, acting through the Administrator and in consultation with the Under Secretary, shall publish for comment in the Federal Register a standard formula to determine and allocate wind losses and flood losses for claims involving indeterminate losses.

(2) Contents

The standard formula established under paragraph (1) shall

(A) incorporate data available from the Coastal Wind and Water Event Database established under section 3611(f) of title 33 ;

(B) use relevant data provided on the National Flood Insurance Program Elevation Certificate, or other data or information used to determine a property’s current risk of flood, as determined by the Administrator, for each indeterminate loss for which the formula is used;

(C) consider any sufficient and credible evidence, approved by the Administrator, of the pre-event condition of a specific property, including the findings of any policyholder or insurance claims adjuster in connection with the indeterminate loss to that specific property;

(D) include other measures, as the Administrator considers appropriate, required to determine and allocate by mathematical formula the property damage caused by flood or storm surge associated with a named storm; and

(E) subject to paragraph (3), for each indeterminate loss, use the post-storm assessment to allocate water damage (flood or storm surge) associated with a named storm.

(3) Degree of accuracy required

The standard formula established under paragraph (1) shall specify that the Administrator may only use the post-storm assessment for purposes of the formula if the Under Secretary certifies that the post-storm assessment has a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent in connection with the specific indeterminate loss for which the assessment and formula are used.
