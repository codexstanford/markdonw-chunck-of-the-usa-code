(A) has been continuously entitled to such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits from the first month for which the increase described in paragraph (2)(C) was reflected in such benefits through the month involved, and

(B) would be eligible for benefits under this subchapter in the month involved if the amount of the increase described in paragraph (2)(C) in his or her widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits, and any subsequent cost-of-living adjustments in such benefits under section 415(i) of this title , were disregarded.

(C) because of the increase in the amount of his or her widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits which resulted from the amendments made by section 134 of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( Public Law 98–21 ) (eliminating the additional reduction factor for disabled widows and widowers under age 60), was ineligible for benefits under this subchapter in the first month in which such increase was paid to him or her (and in which a retroactive payment of such increase for prior months was not made).
