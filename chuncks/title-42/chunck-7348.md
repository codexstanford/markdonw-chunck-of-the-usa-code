#### § 1395r. Amount of premiums for individuals enrolled under this part
##### (f) Limitation on increase in monthly premium

For any calendar year after 1988, if an individual is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title or to a monthly annuity under section 3(a), 4(a), or 4(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [ 45 U.S.C. 231b(a) , 231c(a), (f)] for November and December of the preceding year, if the monthly premium of the individual under this section for December and for January is deducted from those benefits under section 1395s(a)(1) of this title or section 1395s(b)(1) of this title , and if the amount of the individual’s premium is not adjusted for such January under subsection (i), the monthly premium otherwise determined under this section for an individual for that year shall not be increased, pursuant to this subsection, to the extent that such increase would reduce the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that December below the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that November (after the deduction of the premium under this section). For purposes of this subsection, retroactive adjustments or payments and deductions on account of work shall not be taken into account in determining the monthly benefits to which an individual is entitled under section 402 or 423 of this title or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [ 45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.]. Any increase in the premium for an individual who was enrolled under section 1395 o (b) of this title attributable to such individual otherwise enrolling under this part shall not be taken into account in applying this subsection.
