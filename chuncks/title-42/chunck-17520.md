#### § 8833. Guaranteed construction loans
##### (g) Payment of interest; tax consequences

(1) With respect to any loan or debt obligation which is

(A) issued after June 30, 1980 , by, or on behalf of, any State or any political subdivision or governmental entity thereof,

(B) guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy under this section, and

(C) not supported by the full faith and credit of the issuer as a general obligation of the issuer, the interest paid on such obligation and received by the purchaser thereof (or the purchaser’s successors in interest) shall be included in gross income for the purposes of chapter 1 of title 26.

(2) With respect to the amount of obligations described in paragraph (1) that the issuer would have been able to issue as tax exempt obligations (other than obligations secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer as a general obligation of the issuer), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to pay only to the issuer any portion of the interest on such obligations, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into account the interest rate which would have been paid on the obligations had they been issued as tax exempt obligations without being so guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy and the interest rate actually paid on the obligations when issued as taxable obligations. Such payments shall be made in amounts determined by the Secretary of Energy, and in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury shall require.
