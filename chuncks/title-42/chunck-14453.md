(iv) Use .

During the period described in clause (v), a manufacturer may apply the conversion factor established by the Secretary to rerate existing models of covered water heaters that are in existence prior to the effective date of the rule described in clause (v)(II) to comply with the new efficiency descriptor.

(v) Period .

Clause (iv) shall apply during the period

(I) beginning on the date of publication of the conversion factor in the Federal Register; and

(II) ending on the later of 1 year after the date of publication of the conversion factor, or December 31, 2015 .

(F) Exclusions .

The final rule may exclude a specific category of covered water heaters from the uniform efficiency descriptor established under this paragraph if the Secretary determines that the category of water heaters

(i) does not have a residential use and can be clearly described in the final rule; and

(ii) are  1 effectively rated using the thermal efficiency and standby loss descriptors applied (as of December 18, 2012 ) to the category under section 6313(a)(5) of this title .

(G) Options .

The descriptor set by the final rule may be

(i) a revised version of the energy factor descriptor in use as of December 18, 2012 ;

(K) Existing covered water heaters .

A covered water heater shall be considered to comply with the final rule on and after the effective date of the final rule and with any revised labeling requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission to carry out the final rule if the covered water heater

(i) was manufactured prior to the effective date of the final rule; and

(ii) complied with the efficiency standards and labeling requirements in effect prior to the final rule.

(6) Additional standards for grid-enabled water heaters.

(A) Definitions .

In this paragraph:

(i) Activation lock .

The term “activation lock” means a control mechanism (either a physical device directly on the water heater or a control system integrated into the water heater) that is locked by default and contains a physical, software, or digital communication that must be activated with an activation key to enable the product to operate at its designed specifications and capabilities and without which activation the product will provide not greater than 50 percent of the rated first hour delivery of hot water certified by the manufacturer.

(ii) Grid-enabled water heater .

The term “grid-enabled water heater” means an electric resistance water heater that

(I) has a rated storage tank volume of more than 75 gallons;

(II) is manufactured on or after April 16, 2015 ;

(III) has

(aa) an energy factor of not less than 1.061 minus the product obtained by multiplying

(AA) the rated storage volume of the tank, expressed in gallons; and

(BB) 0.00168; or

(bb) an equivalent alternative standard prescribed by the Secretary and developed pursuant to paragraph (5)(E);

(IV) is equipped at the point of manufacture with an activation lock; and

(V) bears a permanent label applied by the manufacturer that

(aa) is made of material not adversely affected by water;

(bb) is attached by means of non-water-soluble adhesive; and

(cc) advises purchasers and end-users of the intended and appropriate use of the product with the following notice printed in 16.5 point Arial Narrow Bold font: “IMPORTANT INFORMATION: This water heater is intended only for use as part of an electric thermal storage or demand response program. It will not provide adequate hot water unless enrolled in such a program and activated by your utility company or another program operator. Confirm the availability of a program in your local area before purchasing or installing this product.”.

(B) Requirement .

The manufacturer or private labeler shall provide the activation key for a grid-enabled water heater only to a utility or other company that operates an electric thermal storage or demand response program that uses such a grid-enabled water heater.

(C) Reports.

(i) Manufacturers .

The Secretary shall require each manufacturer of grid-enabled water heaters to report to the Secretary annually the quantity of grid-enabled water heaters that the manufacturer ships each year.

(ii) Operators .

(iii) Confidentiality requirements .

The Secretary shall treat shipment data reported by manufacturers as confidential business information.

(D) Publication of information.

(i) In general .

In 2017 and 2019, the Secretary shall publish an analysis of the data collected under subparagraph (C) to assess the extent to which shipped products are put into use in demand response and thermal storage programs.

(ii) Prevention of product diversion .

If the Secretary determines that sales of grid-enabled water heaters exceed by 15 percent or greater the quantity of such products activated for use in demand response and thermal storage programs annually, the Secretary shall, after opportunity for notice and comment, establish procedures to prevent product diversion for non-program purposes.

(E) Compliance.

(i) In general .

Subparagraphs (A) through (D) shall remain in effect until the Secretary determines under this section that

(I) grid-enabled water heaters do not require a separate efficiency requirement; or

(II) sales of grid-enabled water heaters exceed by 15 percent or greater the quantity of such products activated for use in demand response and thermal storage programs annually and procedures to prevent product diversion for non-program purposes would not be adequate to prevent such product diversion.

(ii) Effective date .

If the Secretary exercises the authority described in clause (i) or amends the efficiency requirement for grid-enabled water heaters, that action will take effect on the date described in subsection (m)(4)(A)(ii).

(iii) Consideration .

In carrying out this section with respect to electric water heaters, the Secretary shall consider the impact on thermal storage and demand response programs, including any impact on energy savings, electric bills, peak load reduction, electric reliability, integration of renewable resources, and the environment.
