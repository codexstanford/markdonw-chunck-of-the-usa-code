#### § 6307. Consumer education
##### (a) In general

The Secretary shall, in close cooperation and coordination with the Commission and appropriate industry trade associations and industry members, including retailers, and interested consumer and environmental organizations, carry out a program to educate consumers and other persons with respect to

(1) the significance of estimated annual operating costs;

(2) the way in which comparative shopping, including comparisons of estimated annual operating costs, can save energy for the Nation and money for consumers; and

(3) such other matters as the Secretary determines may encourage the conservation of energy in the use of consumer products. Such steps to educate consumers may include publications, audiovisual presentations, demonstrations, and the sponsorship of national and regional conferences involving manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers, and State, local, and Federal Government representatives. Nothing in this section may be construed to require the compilation of lists which compare the estimated annual operating costs of consumer products by model or manufacturer’s name.
