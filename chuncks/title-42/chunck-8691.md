#### § 1396w–3a. Requirements relating to qualified prescription drug monitoring programs and prescribing certain controlled substances
##### (b) Qualified prescription drug monitoring program described

A qualified prescription drug monitoring program described in this subsection is, with respect to a State, a prescription drug monitoring program administered by the State that, at a minimum, satisfies each of the following criteria:

(1) The program facilitates access by a covered provider to, at a minimum, the following information with respect to a covered individual, in as close to real-time as possible:

(A) Information regarding the prescription drug history of a covered individual with respect to controlled substances.

(B) The number and type of controlled substances prescribed to and filled for the covered individual during at least the most recent 12-month period.

(C) The name, location, and contact information (or other identifying number selected by the State, such as a national provider identifier issued by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) of each covered provider who prescribed a controlled substance to the covered individual during at least the most recent 12-month period.

(2) The program facilitates the integration of information described in paragraph (1) into the workflow of a covered provider, which may include the electronic system the covered provider uses to prescribe controlled substances. A qualified prescription drug monitoring program described in this subsection, with respect to a State, may have in place, in accordance with applicable State and Federal law, a data-sharing agreement with the State Medicaid program that allows the medical director and pharmacy director of such program (and any designee of such a director who reports directly to such director) to access the information described in paragraph (1) in an electronic format. The State Medicaid program under this subchapter may facilitate reasonable and limited access, as determined by the State and ensuring documented beneficiary protections regarding the use of such data, to such qualified prescription drug monitoring program for the medical director or pharmacy director of any managed care entity (as defined under section 1396u–2(a)(1)(B) of this title ) that has a contract with the State under section 1396b(m) of this title or under section 1396d(t)(3) of this title , or the medical director or pharmacy director of any entity that has a contract to manage the pharmaceutical benefit with respect to individuals enrolled in the State plan (or under a waiver of the State plan). All applicable State and Federal security and privacy laws shall apply to the directors or designees of such directors of any State Medicaid program or entity accessing a qualified prescription drug monitoring program under this section.
