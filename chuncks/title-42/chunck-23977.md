(1) In general

Not later than 180 days after August 9, 2022 , the Director shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study to evaluate and make recommendations for the quantum information science workforce. The study shall

(A) characterize the quantum information science workforce, including by

(i) describing what constitutes a quantum information science qualified worker across sectors, including academia, the Federal Government, and industry; and

(ii) describing the size and makeup of the quantum information science workforce, including an assessment of current and future trends;

(B) identify near- and long-term quantum information science workforce needs across government, academia, and industry sectors, including identifying the cross-disciplinary academic degrees or academic courses necessary to

(i) prepare students for multiple career pathways in quantum information sciences and related fields;

(ii) ensure the United States is competitive in the field of quantum information science while preserving national security; and

(iii) support the development of quantum applications;

(C) assess the state of quantum information science education and skills training at all education levels and identify gaps in meeting current and future workforce needs, including with respect to

(i) elementary, middle, and high-school student access to foundational courses, age-appropriate quantum concepts, and hands-on learning opportunities;

(ii) elementary, middle, and high-school teacher professional development and access to resources, materials, lesson plans, modules, and curricula;

(iii) career pivot and skills training opportunities, including professional certificates and internships; and

(iv) higher education curricula, laboratory experiences in academia, the Federal Government, and industry settings, and cross-discipline degree programs aligned with workforce needs; and

(D) make recommendations for developing a diverse, flexible, and sustainable quantum information science workforce that meets the evolving needs of academia, the Federal Government, and industry.

(2) Report

Not later than two years after August 9, 2022 , the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine shall submit to Congress and the Director a report containing the results of the study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1).
