#### § 1396r–8. Payment for covered outpatient drugs
##### (b) Terms of rebate agreement

(1) Periodic rebates

(A) In general

A rebate agreement under this subsection shall require the manufacturer to provide, to each State plan approved under this subchapter, a rebate for a rebate period in an amount specified in subsection (c) for covered outpatient drugs of the manufacturer dispensed after December 31, 1990 , for which payment was made under the State plan for such period, including such drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled with a medicaid managed care organization if the organization is responsible for coverage of such drugs. Such rebate shall be paid by the manufacturer not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the information described in paragraph (2) for the period involved.

(B) Offset against medical assistance

Amounts received by a State under this section (or under an agreement authorized by the Secretary under subsection (a)(1) or an agreement described in subsection (a)(4)) in any quarter, including amounts received by a State under subsection (c)(4), shall be considered to be a reduction in the amount expended under the State plan in the quarter for medical assistance for purposes of section 1396b(a)(1) of this title .

(C) Special rule for increased minimum rebate percentage

(i) In general

In addition to the amounts applied as a reduction under subparagraph (B), for rebate periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010 , during a fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce payments to a State under section 1396b(a) of this title in the manner specified in clause (ii), in an amount equal to the product of

(I) 100 percent minus the Federal medical assistance percentage applicable to the rebate period for the State; and

(II) the amounts received by the State under such subparagraph that are attributable (as estimated by the Secretary based on utilization and other data) to the increase in the minimum rebate percentage effected by the amendments made by subsections (a)(1), (b), and (d) of section 2501 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, taking into account the additional drugs included under the amendments made by subsection (c) of section 2501 of such Act.  The Secretary shall adjust such payment reduction for a calendar quarter to the extent the Secretary determines, based upon subsequent utilization and other data, that the reduction for such quarter was greater or less than the amount of payment reduction that should have been made.

(ii) Manner of payment reduction

The amount of the payment reduction under clause (i) for a State for a quarter shall be deemed an overpayment to the State under this subchapter to be disallowed against the State’s regular quarterly draw for all Medicaid spending under section 1396b(d)(2) of this title . Such a disallowance is not subject to a reconsideration under section 1316(d) of this title .

(2) State provision of information

(A) State responsibility

Each State agency under this subchapter shall report to each manufacturer not later than 60 days after the end of each rebate period and in a form consistent with a standard reporting format established by the Secretary, information on the total number of units of each dosage form and strength and package size of each covered outpatient drug dispensed after December 31, 1990 , for which payment was made under the plan during the period, including such information reported by each medicaid managed care organization, and shall promptly transmit a copy of such report to the Secretary.

(B) Audits

Such civil money penalties are in addition to other penalties as may be prescribed by law. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a), (b), (f)(3), and (f)(4)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this subparagraph in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .

(aa) the total amount of rebates that the manufacturer paid with respect to the drug to all States for all rebate periods during which the drug was misclassified; and
