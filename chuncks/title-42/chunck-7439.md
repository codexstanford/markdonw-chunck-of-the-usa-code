#### § 1395w–3a. Use of average sales price payment methodology
##### (d) Monitoring of market prices

(1) In general

The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services shall conduct studies, which may include surveys, to determine the widely available market prices of drugs and biologicals to which this section applies, as the Inspector General, in consultation with the Secretary, determines to be appropriate.

(2) Comparison of prices

Based upon such studies and other data for drugs and biologicals, the Inspector General shall compare the average sales price under this section for drugs and biologicals with

(A) the widely available market price for such drugs and biologicals (if any); and

(B) the average manufacturer price (as determined under section 1396r–8(k)(1) of this title ) for such drugs and biologicals.

(3) Limitation on average sales price

(A) In general

The Secretary may disregard the average sales price for a drug or biological that exceeds the widely available market price or the average manufacturer price for such drug or biological by the applicable threshold percentage (as defined in subparagraph (B)).

(B) Applicable threshold percentage defined

In this paragraph, the term “applicable threshold percentage” means

(i) in 2005, in the case of an average sales price for a drug or biological that exceeds widely available market price or the average manufacturer price, 5 percent; and

(ii) in 2006 and subsequent years, the percentage applied under this subparagraph subject to such adjustment as the Secretary may specify for the widely available market price or the average manufacturer price, or both.

(C) Authority to adjust average sales price

If the Inspector General finds that the average sales price for a drug or biological exceeds such widely available market price or average manufacturer price for such drug or biological by the applicable threshold percentage, the Inspector General shall inform the Secretary (at such times as the Secretary may specify to carry out this subparagraph) and the Secretary shall, effective as of the next quarter, substitute for the amount of payment otherwise determined under this section for such drug or biological the lesser of

(i) the widely available market price for the drug or biological (if any); or

(ii) 103 percent of the average manufacturer price (as determined under section 1396r–8(k)(1) of this title ) for the drug or biological.

(4) Civil money penalty

(A) Misrepresentation

If the Secretary determines that a manufacturer has made a misrepresentation in the reporting of the manufacturer’s average sales price for a drug or biological, the Secretary may apply a civil money penalty in an amount of up to $10,000 for each such price misrepresentation and for each day in which such price misrepresentation was applied.

(B) Failure to provide timely information

If the Secretary determines that a manufacturer described in subsection (f)(2) has failed to report on information described in section 1396r–8(b)(3)(A)(iii) of this title with respect to a drug or biological in accordance with such subsection, the Secretary shall apply a civil money penalty in an amount of $10,000 for each day the manufacturer has failed to report such information and such amount shall be paid to the Treasury.

(C) False information

Any manufacturer required to submit information under subsection (f)(2) that knowingly provides false information is subject to a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $100,000 for each item of false information. Such civil money penalties are in addition to other penalties as may be prescribed by law.

(D) Increasing oversight and enforcement

For calendar quarters beginning on or after January 1, 2022 , section 1396r–8(b)(3)(C)(iv) of this title shall be applied as if

(i) each reference to “under this subparagraph and subsection (c)(4)(B)(ii)(III)” were a reference to “under this subparagraph, subsection (c)(4)(B)(ii)(III), and subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 1395w–3a(d)(4) of this title ”; and

(ii) the reference to “activities related to the oversight and enforcement of this section and agreements under this section” were a reference to “activities related to the oversight and enforcement of this section and under subsection (f)(2) of section 1395w–3a of this title and subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this sub section 1395w–3a(d)(4) of this title and, if applicable, agreements under this section”.

(E) Procedures

The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to civil money penalties under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) in the same manner as they apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .

(5) Widely available market price

(A) In general

In this subsection, the term “widely available market price” means the price that a prudent physician or supplier would pay for the drug or biological. In determining such price, the Inspector General shall take into account the discounts, rebates, and other price concessions routinely made available to such prudent physicians or suppliers for such drugs or biologicals.

(B) Considerations

In determining the price under subparagraph (A), the Inspector General shall consider information from one or more of the following sources:

(i) Manufacturers.

(ii) Wholesalers.

(iii) Distributors.

(iv) Physician supply houses.

(v) Specialty pharmacies.
