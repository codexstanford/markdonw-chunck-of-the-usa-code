### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395d. Scope of benefits
##### (d) Hospice care; election; waiver of rights; revocation; change of election
######## (B) After an individual makes such an election with respect to a 90-day period or a subsequent 60-day period, the individual may revoke the election during the period, in which case

(i) the revocation shall act as a waiver of the right to have payment made under this part for any hospice care benefits for the remaining time in such period and (for purposes of subsection (a)(4) and subparagraph (A)) the individual shall be deemed to have been provided such benefits during such entire period, and

(ii) the individual may at any time after the revocation execute a new election for a subsequent period, if the individual otherwise is entitled to hospice care benefits with respect to such a period.

(C) An individual may, once in each such period, change the hospice program with respect to which the election is made and such change shall not be considered a revocation of an election under subparagraph (B).

(D) For purposes of this subchapter, an individual’s election with respect to a hospice program shall no longer be considered to be in effect with respect to that hospice program after the date the individual’s revocation or change of election with respect to that election takes effect.
