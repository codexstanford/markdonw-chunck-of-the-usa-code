### CHAPTER 50— NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE
#### § 4001. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
##### (d) Authorization of flood insurance program; flexibility in program

It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to (1) authorize a flood insurance program by means of which flood insurance, over a period of time, can be made available on a nationwide basis through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the private insurance industry, and (2) provide flexibility in the program so that such flood insurance may be based on workable methods of pooling risks, minimizing costs, and distributing burdens equitably among those who will be protected by flood insurance and the general public.
