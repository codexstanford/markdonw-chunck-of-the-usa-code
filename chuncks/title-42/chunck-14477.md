### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (p) Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards

Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:

(1) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.

(2) After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with section 6306 of this title , afford interested persons an opportunity, during a period of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such presentations, as provided in such section) on matters relating to such proposed rule, including

(A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection ( o )(2)) or will result in the effects described in subsection ( o )(4);

(B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;

(C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and

(D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.

(3) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.

(4) Direct final rules.

(A) In general .

On receipt of a statement that is submitted jointly by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view (including representatives of manufacturers of covered products, States, and efficiency advocates), as determined by the Secretary, and contains recommendations with respect to an energy or water conservation standard

(i) if the Secretary determines that the recommended standard contained in the statement is in accordance with subsection ( o ) or section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title , as applicable, the Secretary may issue a final rule that establishes an energy or water conservation standard and is published simultaneously with a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes a new or amended energy or water conservation standard that is identical to the standard established in the final rule to establish the recommended standard (referred to in this paragraph as a “direct final rule”); or

(ii) if the Secretary determines that a direct final rule cannot be issued based on the statement, the Secretary shall publish a notice of the determination, together with an explanation of the reasons for the determination.

(B) Public comment .

The Secretary shall solicit public comment for a period of at least 110 days with respect to each direct final rule issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A)(i).

(C) Withdrawal of direct final rules.

(i) In general .

Not later than 120 days after the date on which a direct final rule issued under subparagraph (A)(i) is published in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall withdraw the direct final rule if

(I) the Secretary receives 1 or more adverse public comments relating to the direct final rule under subparagraph (B)(i)  5 or any alternative joint recommendation; and

(II) based on the rulemaking record relating to the direct final rule, the Secretary determines that such adverse public comments or alternative joint recommendation may provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the direct final rule under subsection ( o ), section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title , or any other applicable law.

(ii) Action on withdrawal .

On withdrawal of a direct final rule under clause (i), the Secretary shall

(I) proceed with the notice of proposed rulemaking published simultaneously with the direct final rule as described in subparagraph (A)(i); and

(II) publish in the Federal Register the reasons why the direct final rule was withdrawn.

(iii) Treatment of withdrawn direct final rules .

A direct final rule that is withdrawn under clause (i) shall not be considered to be a final rule for purposes of subsection ( o ).

(D) Effect of paragraph .

Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the Secretary to issue a direct final rule based solely on receipt of more than 1 statement containing recommended standards relating to the direct final rule.
