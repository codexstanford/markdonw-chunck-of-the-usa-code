(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the adoption and legal guardianship incentive payment payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be equal to the sum of

(A) $5,000, multiplied by the amount (if any) by which

(i) the number of foster child adoptions in the State during the fiscal year; exceeds

(ii) the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of

(I) the base rate of foster child adoptions for the State for the fiscal year; and

(II) the number of children in foster care under the supervision of the State on the last day of the preceding fiscal year;

(B) $7,500, multiplied by the amount (if any) by which

(i) the number of pre-adolescent child adoptions and pre-adolescent foster child guardianships in the State during the fiscal year; exceeds

(ii) the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of

(I) the base rate of pre-adolescent child adoptions and pre-adolescent foster child guardianships for the State for the fiscal year; and

(II) the number of children in foster care under the supervision of the State on the last day of the preceding fiscal year who have attained 9 years of age but not 14 years of age; and

(C) $10,000, multiplied by the amount (if any) by which

(i) the number of older child adoptions and older foster child guardianships in the State during the fiscal year; exceeds

(ii) the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of

(I) the base rate of older child adoptions and older foster child guardianships for the State for the fiscal year; and

(II) the number of children in foster care under the supervision of the State on the last day of the preceding fiscal year who have attained 14 years of age; and

(D) $4,000, multiplied by the amount (if any) by which

(i) the number of foster child guardianships in the State during the fiscal year; exceeds

(ii) the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of

(I) the base rate of foster child guardianships for the State for the fiscal year; and

(II) the number of children in foster care under the supervision of the State on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.

(2) Pro rata adjustment if insufficient funds available

For any fiscal year, if the total amount of adoption incentive payments otherwise payable under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year exceeds the amount appropriated pursuant to subsection (h) for the fiscal year, the amount of the adoption incentive payment payable to each State under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year shall be

(A) the amount of the adoption and legal guardianship incentive payment that would otherwise be payable to the State under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year; multiplied by

(B) the percentage represented by the amount so appropriated for the fiscal year, divided by the total amount of adoption and legal guardianship incentive payments otherwise payable under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year.

(3) Increased adoption and legal guardianship incentive payment for timely adoptions

(A) In general

If for any of fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the total amount of adoption and legal guardianship incentive payments payable under paragraph (1) of this subsection are less than the amount appropriated under subsection (h) for the fiscal year, then, from the remainder of the amount appropriated for the fiscal year that is not required for such payments (in this paragraph referred to as the “timely adoption award pool”), the Secretary shall increase the adoption incentive payment determined under paragraph (1) for each State that the Secretary determines is a timely adoption award State for the fiscal year by the award amount determined for the fiscal year under subparagraph (C).

(B) Timely adoption award State defined

A State is a timely adoption award State for a fiscal year if the Secretary determines that, for children who were in foster care under the supervision of the State at the time of adoptive placement, the average number of months from removal of children from their home to the placement of children in finalized adoptions is less than 24 months.

(C) Award amount

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the award amount determined under this subparagraph with respect to a fiscal year is the amount equal to the timely adoption award pool for the fiscal year divided by the number of timely adoption award States for the fiscal year.
