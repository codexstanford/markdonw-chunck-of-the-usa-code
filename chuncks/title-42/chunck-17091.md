### CHAPTER 91— NATIONAL ENERGY CONSERVATION POLICY
#### § 8253. Energy and water management requirements
##### (e) Metering of energy and water use

(1) Deadline

By October 1, 2022 , in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary under paragraph (2), all Federal buildings shall, for the purposes of efficient use of energy and water and reduction in the cost of electricity and water used in such buildings, be metered. Each agency shall use, to the maximum extent practicable, advanced meters or advanced metering devices that provide data at least daily and that measure at least hourly consumption of electricity and water in the Federal buildings of the agency. Not later than October 1, 2016 , each agency shall provide for equivalent metering of natural gas and steam, in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary under paragraph (2). Such data shall be incorporated into existing Federal energy and water tracking systems and made available to Federal facility managers.

(2) Guidelines

(A) In general

Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005 , the Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, representatives from the metering industry, utility industry, energy services industry, energy efficiency industry, energy efficiency advocacy organizations, national laboratories, universities, Federal facility managers, and any other person the Secretary deems necessary, shall establish guidelines for agencies to carry out paragraph (1).

(B) Requirements for guidelines

The guidelines shall

(i) take into consideration

(I) the cost of metering and the reduced cost of operation and maintenance expected to result from metering;

(II) the extent to which metering is expected to result in increased potential for energy and water management, increased potential for energy and water savings and energy and water efficiency improvement, and cost and energy and water savings due to utility contract aggregation; and

(III) the measurement and verification protocols of the Department of Energy;

(ii) include recommendations concerning the amount of funds and the number of trained personnel necessary to gather and use the metering information to track and reduce energy and water use;

(iii) establish priorities for types and locations of buildings to be metered based on cost-effectiveness and a schedule of one or more dates, not later than 1 year after the date of issuance of the guidelines, on which the requirements specified in paragraph (1) shall take effect; and

(iv) establish exclusions from the requirements specified in paragraph (1) based on the de minimis quantity of energy and water use of a Federal building, industrial process, or structure.

(C) Update

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall update the guidelines established under subparagraph (A) to take into account water efficiency requirements under this section.

(3) Plan

Not later than 180 days after the date on which guidelines are updated under paragraph (2)(C), in a report submitted by the agency under section 8258(a) of this title , each agency shall submit to the Secretary a plan describing the manner in which the agency will implement the requirements of paragraph (1), including

(A) how the agency will designate personnel primarily responsible for achieving the requirements; and

(B) a demonstration by the agency, complete with documentation, of any finding that advanced meters or advanced metering devices (as those terms are used in paragraph (1)), are not practicable.

(4) Best practices report

(A) In general

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General Services, shall develop, and issue a report on, best practices for the use of advanced metering of energy and water use in Federal facilities, buildings, and equipment by Federal agencies.

(B) Components

The report shall include, at a minimum

(i) summaries and analysis of the reports by agencies under paragraph (3);

(ii) recommendations on standard requirements or guidelines for automated energy and water management systems, including

(I) potential common communications standards to allow data sharing and reporting;

(II) means of facilitating continuous commissioning of buildings and evidence-based maintenance of buildings and building systems; and

(III) standards for sufficient levels of security and protection against cyber threats to ensure systems cannot be controlled by unauthorized persons; and

(iii) an analysis of

(I) the types of advanced metering and monitoring systems being piloted, tested, or installed in Federal buildings; and

(II) existing techniques used within the private sector or other non-Federal government buildings.
