(B) contribution into a health opportunity account. Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as preventing a State from providing for coverage of preventive care (referred to in subsection (a)(3)) within the alternative benefits without regard to the annual deductible.

(2) Annual deductible

The amount of the annual deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be at least 100 percent, but no more than 110 percent, of the annualized amount of contributions to the health opportunity account under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i), determined without regard to any limitation described in subsection (d)(2)(C)(i)(II).

In the case of an individual who is participating in a State demonstration program and who is not enrolled with a Medicaid managed care organization, the State shall provide that the individual may obtain demonstration program Medicaid services from

(ii) any other provider at payment rates that do not exceed 125 percent of the payment rate that would be applicable to such services furnished by a participating provider under this subchapter if the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable.

(C) Computation

The payment rates described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be computed without regard to any cost sharing that would be otherwise applicable under sections 1396 o and 1396 o –1 of this title.

(D) Definitions

For purposes of this paragraph:

(I) with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (A), a health care provider that has entered into a participation agreement with the State for the provision of services to individuals entitled to benefits under the State plan; or

(II) with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (B) who is enrolled in a Medicaid managed care organization, a health care provider that has entered into an arrangement for the provision of services to enrollees of the organization under this subchapter.

(4) No effect on subsequent benefits

Except as provided under paragraphs (1) and (2), alternative benefits for an eligible individual shall consist of the benefits otherwise provided to the individual, including cost sharing relating to such benefits.

(5) Overriding cost sharing and comparability requirements for alternative benefits

The provisions of this subchapter relating to cost sharing for benefits (including sections 1396 o and 1396 o –1 of this title) shall not apply with respect to benefits to which the annual deductible under paragraph (1)(A) applies. The provisions of section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title (relating to comparability) shall not apply with respect to the provision of alternative benefits (as described in this subsection).

(6) Treatment as medical assistance

Subject to subparagraphs (D) and (E) of subsection (d)(2), payments for alternative benefits under this section (including contributions into a health opportunity account) shall be treated as medical assistance for purposes of section 1396b(a) of this title .

(7) Use of tiered deductible and cost sharing

(A) In general

A State

(i) may vary the amount of the annual deductible applied under paragraph (1)(A) based on the income of the family involved so long as it does not favor families with higher income over those with lower income; and

(ii) may vary the amount of the maximum out-of-pocket cost sharing (as defined in subparagraph (B)) based on the income of the family involved so long as it does not favor families with higher income over those with lower income.

(B) Maximum out-of-pocket cost sharing

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the term “maximum out-of-pocket cost sharing” means, for an individual or family, the amount by which the annual deductible level applied under paragraph (1)(A) to the individual or family exceeds the balance in the health opportunity account for the individual or family.

(8) Contributions by employers

Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an employer from providing health benefits coverage consisting of the coverage described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals who are provided alternative benefits under this section.
