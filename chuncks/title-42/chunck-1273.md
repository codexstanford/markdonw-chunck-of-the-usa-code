##### (d) Priority

In awarding grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under this section, the Secretary may give priority to entities that explore the use of cost-sharing with respect to activities funded under the grant, contract, or agreement to ensure the institutional commitment of the recipients of such assistance to the projects funded under the grant, contract, or agreement. Such non-Federal cost sharing contributions may be provided directly or through donations from public or private entities and may be in cash or in-kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services.
