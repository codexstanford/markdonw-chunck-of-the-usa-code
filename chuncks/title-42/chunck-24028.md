(2) Eligible entities

An eligible entity referred to in paragraph (1) is

(A) a National Laboratory;

(B) an institution of higher education, including a historically Black college or university, a Tribal College or University, and a minority-serving institution;

(C) a private commercial entity;

(D) a research center;

(E) a partnership or consortium of 2 or more entities described in subparagraphs (A) through (D); and

(F) any other entity that the Secretary determines appropriate.

(3) Activities

The activities of a Center shall include research, development, and demonstration activities for

(A) accelerating the development of new microelectronics science and technology, including materials, devices, circuits, systems, architectures, fabrication tools, processes, diagnostics, modeling, synthesis, and, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, metrology;

(B) advancing the sustainability and energy efficiency of new microelectronics devices, packages, and systems;

(C) application-driven codesign and prototyping of novel devices to facilitate laboratory-to-fabrication transition;

(D) advancing knowledge and experimental capabilities in surface and materials science, plasma science, and computational and theoretical methods, including artificial intelligence, multiscale codesign, and advanced supercomputing capabilities to invent and manufacture revolutionary microelectronic devices;

(E) creating technology testbeds for prototyping platforms for validation and verification of new capabilities and sharing of ideas, intellectual property, and the unique facilities of the Department;

(F) supporting development of cybersecurity capabilities for computing architectures that measurably improve safety and security and are adaptable for existing and future applications; and

(G) supporting long-term and short-term workforce development in microelectronics.

(4) Request for proposals; merit review

(A) In general

The Director shall, at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Director determines to be appropriate, issue a request for proposals from eligible entities described in paragraph (2) seeking to be designated as a Center.

(B) Competitive merit review

The Director shall select eligible entities under subparagraph (A) through a competitive, merit-based process.

(5) Operation

(A) Duration

(i) In general

Each Center shall operate for a period of not more than 5 years, unless renewed for an additional 5-year period in accordance with clause (ii).

(ii) Renewal

(I) Initial renewal

In the case of a Center that has operated for not more than 5 years, the Director may renew support for the Center on a merit-reviewed basis for a period of not more than 5 years.

(II) 10-year operation

In the case of a Center that has operated for not less than 5 years but not more than 10 years, the Director may renew support for the Center on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis for a period of not more than 5 years.

(III) 15-year operation

In the case of a Center that has operated for not less than 10 years but not more than 15 years, the Director may renew support for the Center on a merit-reviewed basis for a period of not more than 5 years.

(B) Termination

Consistent with the existing authorities of the Department, the Director may terminate an underperforming Center during the performance period.

(6) Technology transfer

The Director, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Technology Transitions, shall seek to enter into partnerships with industry groups to facilitate the translation and transfer of research results produced by the Centers.

(7) Coordination

The Secretary shall

(A) establish a coordinating network to coordinate cross-cutting research and foster communication and collaboration among the Centers; and

(B) ensure coordination, and avoid unnecessary duplication, of the activities of each Center with the activities of

(i) other research entities of the Department, including

(I) the Nanoscale Science Research Centers;

(II) the National Quantum Information Science Research Centers;

(III) the Energy Frontier Research Centers;

(IV) the Energy Innovation Hubs;

(V) the National Laboratories; and

(VI) other offices of the Department;

(ii) the National Semiconductor Technology Center established under section 4656(c)(1) of title 15 ;

(iii) institutions of higher education;

(iv) industry; and

(v) relevant research activities carried out by other Federal agencies.

(8) Workforce development

Each Center shall support workforce development through

(A) incorporation of undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and early career researchers, as well as elementary school, secondary school, and high school students, through opportunities such as dual-enrollment programs and work-based learning programs, as applicable;

(B) hands-on research and equipment training programs;

(C) technical training and certificate programs for the skilled technical workforce;

(D) facilitation of engagement among academic, industry, and laboratory researchers; and

(E) public outreach activities, including to students at elementary school, secondary school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, which may include educational programming with an emphasis on experiential and project-based learning.

(9) Outreach

The Director shall support the workforce development of Centers under paragraph (8) by conducting outreach to recruit applicants and engage participants from all regions of the United States, especially individuals from underserved communities and groups historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

(10) Intellectual property

The Secretary shall ensure that the intellectual property and value proposition created by the Centers are retained within the United States.

(11) Notification

(A) Definition of covered determination

In this paragraph, the term “covered determination” means a determination of the Secretary
