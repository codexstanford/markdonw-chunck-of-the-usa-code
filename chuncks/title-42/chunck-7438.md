### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–3a. Use of average sales price payment methodology
##### (c) Manufacturer’s average sales price

(1) In general

For purposes of this section, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the manufacturer’s “average sales price” means, of a drug or biological for a National Drug Code for a calendar quarter for a manufacturer for a unit

(A) the manufacturer’s sales to all purchasers (excluding sales exempted in paragraph (2)) in the United States for such drug or biological in the calendar quarter; divided by

(B) the total number of such units of such drug or biological sold by the manufacturer in such quarter.

(2) Certain sales exempted from computation

In calculating the manufacturer’s average sales price under this subsection, the following sales shall be excluded:

(A) Sales exempt from best price

Sales exempt from the inclusion in the determination of “best price” under section 1396r–8(c)(1)(C)(i) of this title .

(B) Sales at nominal charge

Such other sales as the Secretary identifies as sales to an entity that are merely nominal in amount (as applied for purposes of section 1396r–8(c)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of this title , except as the Secretary may otherwise provide).

(3) Sale price net of discounts

In calculating the manufacturer’s average sales price under this subsection, such price shall include volume discounts, prompt pay discounts, cash discounts, free goods that are contingent on any purchase requirement, chargebacks, and rebates (other than rebates under subsection (i), section 1396r–8 of this title , or section 1395w–114b of this title ). For years after 2004, the Secretary may include in such price other price concessions, which may be based on recommendations of the Inspector General, that would result in a reduction of the cost to the purchaser.

(4) Payment methodology in cases where average sales price during first quarter of sales is unavailable

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), in the case of a drug or biological during an initial period (not to exceed a full calendar quarter) in which data on the prices for sales for the drug or biological is not sufficiently available from the manufacturer to compute an average sales price for the drug or biological, the Secretary may determine the amount payable under this section

(i) in the case of a drug or biological furnished prior to January 1, 2019 , based on

(I) the wholesale acquisition cost; or

(II) the methodologies in effect under this part on November 1, 2003 , to determine payment amounts for drugs or biologicals; and

(ii) in the case of a drug or biological furnished on or after January 1, 2019

(I) at an amount not to exceed 103 percent of the wholesale acquisition cost; or

(II) based on the methodologies in effect under this part on November 1, 2003 , to determine payment amounts for drugs or biologicals.

(B) Limitation on payment amount for biosimilar biological products during initial period

In the case of a biosimilar biological product furnished on or after July 1, 2024 , during the initial period described in subparagraph (A) with respect to the biosimilar biological product, the amount payable under this section for the biosimilar biological product is the lesser of the following:

(i) The amount determined under clause (ii) of such subparagraph for the biosimilar biological product.

(ii) The amount determined under subsection (b)(1)(B) for the reference biological product.

(5) Frequency of determinations

(A) In general on a quarterly basis

The manufacturer’s average sales price, for a drug or biological of a manufacturer, shall be calculated by such manufacturer under this subsection on a quarterly basis. In making such calculation insofar as there is a lag in the reporting of the information on rebates and chargebacks under paragraph (3) so that adequate data are not available on a timely basis, the manufacturer shall apply a methodology based on a 12-month rolling average for the manufacturer to estimate costs attributable to rebates and chargebacks. For years after 2004, the Secretary may establish a uniform methodology under this subparagraph to estimate and apply such costs.

(B) Updates in payment amounts

The payment amounts under subsection (b) shall be updated by the Secretary on a quarterly basis and shall be applied based upon the manufacturer’s average sales price calculated for the most recent calendar quarter for which data is available.

(C) Use of contractors; implementation

The Secretary may contract with appropriate entities to calculate the payment amount under subsection (b). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may implement, by program instruction or otherwise, any of the provisions of this section.

(6) Definitions and other rules

In this section:

(A) Manufacturer

The term “manufacturer” means, with respect to a drug or biological, the manufacturer (as defined in section 1396r–8(k)(5) of this title ), except that, for purposes of subsection (f)(2), the Secretary may, if the Secretary determines appropriate, exclude repackagers of a drug or biological from such term.

(B) Wholesale acquisition cost

The term “wholesale acquisition cost” means, with respect to a drug or biological, the manufacturer’s list price for the drug or biological to wholesalers or direct purchasers in the United States, not including prompt pay or other discounts, rebates or reductions in price, for the most recent month for which the information is available, as reported in wholesale price guides or other publications of drug or biological pricing data.

(C) Multiple source drug

(i) In general

The term “multiple source drug” means, for a calendar quarter, a drug for which there are 2 or more drug products which

(I) are rated as therapeutically equivalent (under the Food and Drug Administration’s most recent publication of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations”),

(II) except as provided in subparagraph (E), are pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent, as determined under subparagraph (F) and as determined by the Food and Drug Administration, and

(III) are sold or marketed in the United States during the quarter.

(ii) Exception

With respect to single source drugs or biologicals that are within the same billing and payment code as of October 1, 2003 , the Secretary shall treat such single source drugs or biologicals as if the single source drugs or biologicals were multiple source drugs.

(D) Single source drug or biological

The term “single source drug or biological” means

(i) a biological; or

(ii) a drug which is not a multiple source drug and which is produced or distributed under a new drug application approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including a drug product marketed by any cross-licensed producers or distributors operating under the new drug application.

(E) Exception from pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence requirement

Subparagraph (C)(ii) shall not apply if the Food and Drug Administration changes by regulation the requirement that, for purposes of the publication described in subparagraph (C)(i), in order for drug products to be rated as therapeutically equivalent, they must be pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent, as defined in subparagraph (F).

(F) Determination of pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence

For purposes of this paragraph

(i) drug products are pharmaceutically equivalent if the products contain identical amounts of the same active drug ingredient in the same dosage form and meet compendial or other applicable standards of strength, quality, purity, and identity; and

(ii) drugs are bioequivalent if they do not present a known or potential bioequivalence problem, or, if they do present such a problem, they are shown to meet an appropriate standard of bioequivalence.

(G) Inclusion of vaccines

In applying provisions of section 1396r–8 of this title under this section, “other than a vaccine” is deemed deleted from section 1396r–8(k)(2)(B) of this title .

(H) Biosimilar biological product

The term “biosimilar biological product” means a biological product approved under an abbreviated application for a license of a biological product that relies in part on data or information in an application for another biological product licensed under section 262 of this title .

(I) Reference biological product

The term “reference biological product” means the biological product licensed under such section 262 of this title that is referred to in the application described in subparagraph (H) of the biosimilar biological product.
