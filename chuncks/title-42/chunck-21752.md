#### § 16231. Renewable energy
##### (a) In general

(1) Objectives

The Secretary shall conduct programs of renewable energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application, including activities described in this part. Such programs shall take into consideration the following objectives:

(A) Increasing the conversion efficiency of all forms of renewable energy through improved technologies.

(B) Decreasing the cost of renewable energy generation and delivery.

(C) Promoting the diversity of the energy supply.

(D) Decreasing the dependence of the United States on foreign energy supplies.

(E) Improving United States energy security.

(F) Decreasing the environmental impact of energy-related activities.

(G) Increasing the export of renewable generation equipment from the United States.

(2) Programs

(A) Geothermal

The Secretary shall conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for geothermal energy. The program shall focus on developing improved technologies for reducing the costs of geothermal energy installations, including technologies for

(i) improving detection of geothermal resources;

(ii) decreasing drilling costs;

(iii) decreasing maintenance costs through improved materials;

(iv) increasing the potential for other revenue sources, such as mineral production; and

(v) increasing the understanding of reservoir life cycle and management.

(B) Hydropower

The Secretary shall conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for cost competitive technologies that enable the development of new and incremental hydropower capacity, adding to the diversity of the energy supply of the United States, including:

(i) Fish-friendly large turbines.

(ii) Advanced technologies to enhance environmental performance and yield greater energy efficiencies.

(C) Miscellaneous projects

The Secretary shall conduct research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs for

(i) ocean energy, including wave energy;

(ii) the combined use of renewable energy technologies with one another and with other energy technologies, including the combined use of wind power and coal gasification technologies;

(iii) renewable energy technologies for cogeneration of hydrogen and electricity; and

(iv) kinetic hydro turbines.
