#### § 1395ww. Payments to hospitals for inpatient hospital services
##### (b) Computation of payment; definitions; exemptions; adjustments
######## (E) In the case of a hospital described in clause (v) of subsection (d)(1)(B), the term “target amount” means

(i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital

(I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the “base cost reporting period”) preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by

(II) the sum of the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period, or

(ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(ii) for that later cost reporting period. There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital’s cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

(F)

(II) The Secretary shall increase the amount determined under subclause (I) for each cost reporting period by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(ii) for each subsequent cost reporting period up to the cost reporting period described in clause (i).

(III) The Secretary shall identify among such 5 cost reporting periods the cost reporting periods for which the amount determined under subclause (II) is the highest, and the lowest.

(IV) The Secretary shall compute the averages of the amounts determined under subclause (II) for the 3 cost reporting periods not identified under subclause (III).

(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, each of the following shall be treated as a separate class of hospital:

(I) Hospitals described in clause (i) of subsection (d)(1)(B) and psychiatric units described in the matter following clause (v) of such subsection.

(II) Hospitals described in clause (ii) of such subsection and rehabilitation units described in the matter following clause (v) of such subsection.

(III) Hospitals described in clause (iii) of such subsection.

(IV) Hospitals described in clause (iv) of such subsection.

(G)

(i) In the case of a qualified long-term care hospital (as defined in clause (ii)) that elects (in a form and manner determined by the Secretary) this subparagraph to apply to the hospital, the target amount for the hospital’s 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1998 is equal to the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4)) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1996, increased by the applicable percentage increase for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1997.
