### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396r. Requirements for nursing facilities
##### (g) Survey and certification process

(1) State and Federal responsibility

(A) In general

Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of nursing facilities (other than facilities of the State) with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d). The Secretary shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of State nursing facilities with the requirements of such subsections.

(B) Educational program

Each State shall conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of nursing facilities in order to present current regulations, procedures, and policies under this section.

(C) Investigation of allegations of resident neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property

The State shall provide, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of nursing facilities under this subsection, for a process for the receipt and timely review and investigation of allegations of neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property by a nurse aide of a resident in a nursing facility or by another individual used by the facility in providing services to such a resident. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that a nurse aide has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the nurse aide and the registry of such finding. If the State finds that any other individual used by the facility has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the appropriate licensure authority. A State shall not make a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the individual.

(D) Removal of name from nurse aide registry

(i) In general

In the case of a finding of neglect under subparagraph (C), the State shall establish a procedure to permit a nurse aide to petition the State to have his or her name removed from the registry upon a determination by the State that

(I) the employment and personal history of the nurse aide does not reflect a pattern of abusive behavior or neglect; and

(II) the neglect involved in the original finding was a singular occurrence.

(ii) Timing of determination

In no case shall a determination on a petition submitted under clause (i) be made prior to the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the name of the petitioner was added to the registry under subparagraph (C).

(E) Construction

The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.

(2) Surveys

(A) Annual standard survey

(i) In general

Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey, to be conducted without any prior notice to the facility. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a nursing facility of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title . The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.

(ii) Contents

Each standard survey shall include, for a case-mix stratified sample of residents

(I) a survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment,

(II) written plans of care provided under subsection (b)(2) and an audit of the residents’ assessments under subsection (b)(3) to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care, and

(III) a review of compliance with residents’ rights under subsection (c).

(iii) Frequency

(I) In general

Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after the date of the previous standard survey conducted under this subparagraph. The statewide average interval between standard surveys of a nursing facility shall not exceed 12 months.

(II) Special surveys

If not otherwise conducted under subclause (I), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management of a nursing facility, or director of nursing in order to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished in the facility.

(B) Extended surveys

(i) In general

Each nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary’s or State’s discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).

(ii) Timing

The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).

(iii) Contents

In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d). Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents’ assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.

(iv) Construction

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended or partial extended survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against a facility under subsection (h) on the basis of findings in a standard survey.

(C) Survey protocol

Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted

(i) based upon a protocol which the Secretary has developed, tested, and validated by not later than January 1, 1990 , and

(ii) by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date. The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary’s responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.

(D) Consistency of surveys

Each State shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.

(E) Survey teams

(i) In general

Surveys under this subsection shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals (including a registered professional nurse).

(ii) Prohibition of conflicts of interest

A State may not use as a member of a survey team under this subsection an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the facility surveyed respecting compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the facility being surveyed.

(iii) Training

The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.

(3) Validation surveys

(A) In general

The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the facility’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.

(B) Scope

With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 nursing facilities in the State.

(C) Reduction in administrative costs for substandard performance

If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State’s survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide for the training of survey teams in the State and shall provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made to the State under section 1396b(a)(2)(D) of this title with respect to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities which were found pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d). A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary’s findings under this subparagraph may obtain reconsideration and review of the findings under section 1316 of this title in the same manner as a State may seek reconsideration and review under that section of the Secretary’s determination under section 1316(a)(1) of this title .

(D) Special surveys of compliance

Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the nursing facility meets such requirements.

(4) Investigation of complaints and monitoring nursing facility compliance

Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to

(A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by nursing facilities, and

(B) monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a nursing facility’s compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), if

(i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;

(ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or

(iii) the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements. A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard nursing facilities.

(5) Disclosure of results of inspections and activities

(A) Public information

Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public

(i) information respecting all surveys and certifications made respecting nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction,

(ii) copies of cost reports of such facilities filed under this subchapter or under subchapter XVIII,

(iii) copies of statements of ownership under section 1320a–3 of this title , and

(iv) information disclosed under section 1320a–5 of this title .

(B) Notice to ombudsman

Each State shall notify the State long-term care ombudsman (established under title III or VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 [ 42 U.S.C. 3021 et seq., 3058 et seq.] in accordance with section 712 of the Act [ 42 U.S.C. 3058g ]) of the State’s findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), or of any adverse action taken against a nursing facility under paragraphs  5 (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (h), with respect to a nursing facility in the State.

(C) Notice to physicians and nursing facility administrator licensing board

If a State finds that a nursing facility has provided substandard quality of care, the State shall notify

(i) the attending physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made, and

(ii) any State board responsible for the licensing of the nursing facility administrator of the facility.

(D) Access to fraud control units

Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under section 1396b(q) of this title ) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys and certifications under this subsection.

(E) Submission of survey and certification information to the Secretary

In order to improve the timeliness of information made available to the public under subparagraph (A) and provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website under subsection (i), each State shall submit information respecting any survey or certification made respecting a nursing facility (including any enforcement actions taken by the State) to the Secretary not later than the date on which the State sends such information to the facility. The Secretary shall use the information submitted under the preceding sentence to update the information provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website as expeditiously as practicable but not less frequently than quarterly.
