Such standards may not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis.

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the plan shall include a description of the procedures used to reduce administrative barriers to the enrollment of children and pregnant women who are eligible for medical assistance under subchapter XIX or for child health assistance or health benefits coverage under this subchapter. Such procedures shall be established and revised as often as the State determines appropriate to take into account the most recent information available to the State identifying such barriers.

(B) Deemed compliance if joint application and renewal process that permits application other than in person

A State shall be deemed to comply with subparagraph (A) if the State’s application and renewal forms and supplemental forms (if any) and information verification process is the same for purposes of establishing and renewing eligibility for children and pregnant women for medical assistance under subchapter XIX and child health assistance under this subchapter, and such process does not require an application to be made in person or a face-to-face interview.

Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as providing an individual with an entitlement to child health assistance under a State child health plan.
