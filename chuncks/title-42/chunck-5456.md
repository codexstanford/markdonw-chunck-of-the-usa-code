##### (j) Representative payees
###### (ii) A protection and advocacy system awarded a grant under this subparagraph shall use the grant funds to

(I) conduct all periodic onsite reviews pursuant to this paragraph and such other reviews of representative payees as the Commissioner may request, including reviews conducted in response to allegations or concerns about the performance or suitability of the payee;

(II) conduct additional reviews that the protection and advocacy system has reason to believe are warranted;

(III) develop corrective action plans to assist representative payees in conforming to requirements specified by the Commissioner;

(V) conduct an initial onsite assessment of any organization that begins collecting a fee for its services as a representative payee to ensure that such organization is established as such a representative payee in accordance with requirements specified by the Commissioner. A protection and advocacy system may refer beneficiaries to other programs or services as the protection and advocacy system considers appropriate.

(iii) To be eligible to receive grants under this section, a protection and advocacy system shall submit an initial application to the Commissioner at such time, in such form and manner, and accompanied by such information and assurances as the Commissioner may require.

(iv)

(I) Subject to subclause (II), the Commissioner shall ensure that any funds used for grants under clause (i) shall be allocated to the protection and advocacy systems serving each of the States and the American Indian consortium in a manner such that the amount provided to each protection and advocacy system bears the same ratio to the total of such funds as the number of represented beneficiaries in the State or American Indian consortium in which such protection and advocacy system is located bears to the total number of represented beneficiaries.
