#### § 1395mm. Payments to health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans
##### (h) Reasonable cost reimbursement contract; requirements

(1) If

(A) the Secretary is not satisfied that an eligible organization has the capacity to bear the risk of potential losses under a risk-sharing contract under this section, or

(B) the eligible organization so elects or has an insufficient number of members to be eligible to enter into a risk-sharing contract under subsection (g)(1), the Secretary may, if he is otherwise satisfied that the eligible organization is able to perform its contractual obligations effectively and efficiently, enter into a contract with such organization pursuant to which such organization is reimbursed on the basis of its reasonable cost (as defined in section 1395x(v) of this title ) in the manner prescribed in paragraph (3).

(2) A reasonable cost reimbursement contract under this subsection may, at the option of such organization, provide that the Secretary

(A) will reimburse hospitals and skilled nursing facilities either for the reasonable cost (as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title ) or for payment amounts determined in accordance with section 1395ww of this title , as applicable, of services furnished to individuals enrolled with such organization pursuant to subsection (d), and

(B) will deduct the amount of such reimbursement from payment which would otherwise be made to such organization. If such an eligible organization pays a hospital or skilled nursing facility directly, the amount paid shall not exceed the reasonable cost of the services (as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title ) or the amount determined under section 1395ww of this title , as applicable, unless such organization demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such excess payments are justified on the basis of advantages gained by the organization.

(3) Payments made to an organization with a reasonable cost reimbursement contract shall be subject to appropriate retroactive corrective adjustment at the end of each contract year so as to assure that such organization is paid for the reasonable cost actually incurred (excluding any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of health services) or the amounts otherwise determined under section 1395ww of this title for the types of expenses otherwise reimbursable under this subchapter for providing services covered under this subchapter to individuals described in subsection (a)(1).

(4) Any reasonable cost reimbursement contract with an eligible organization under this subsection shall provide that the Secretary shall require, at such time following the expiration of each accounting period of the eligible organization (and in such form and in such detail) as he may prescribe

(A) that the organization report to him in an independently certified financial statement its per capita incurred cost based on the types of components of expenses otherwise reimbursable under this subchapter for providing services described in subsection (a)(1), including therein, in accordance with accounting procedures prescribed by the Secretary, its methods of allocating costs between individuals enrolled under this section and other individuals enrolled with such organization;

(B) that failure to report such information as may be required may be deemed to constitute evidence of likely overpayment on the basis of which appropriate collection action may be taken;

(C) that in any case in which an eligible organization is related to another organization by common ownership or control, a consolidated financial statement shall be filed and that the allowable costs for such organization may not include costs for the types of expense otherwise reimbursable under this subchapter, in excess of those which would be determined to be reasonable in accordance with regulations (providing for limiting reimbursement to costs rather than charges to the eligible organization by related organizations and owners) issued by the Secretary; and

(D) that in any case in which compensation is paid by an eligible organization substantially in excess of what is normally paid for similar services by similar practitioners (regardless of method of compensation), such compensation may as appropriate be considered to constitute a distribution of profits.

(5)

(A) After August 5, 1997 , the Secretary may not enter into a reasonable cost reimbursement contract under this subsection (if the contract is not in effect as of August 5, 1997 ), except for a contract with an eligible organization which, immediately previous to entering into such contract, had an agreement in effect under section 1395 l (a)(1)(A) of this title.
