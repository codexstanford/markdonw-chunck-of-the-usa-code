### CHAPTER 134— ENERGY POLICY
#### § 13523. Management plan
##### (c) Energy technology inventory and status report

As part of the management plan, the Secretary, with the advice of the Advisory Board established under section 13522 of this title , shall develop an inventory and status report of technologies to enhance energy supply and to improve the efficiency of energy end uses. The inventory and status report shall include fossil, renewable, nuclear, and energy conservation technologies which have not yet achieved the status of fully reliable and cost-competitive commercial availability, but which the Secretary projects may become available with additional research, development, and demonstration. The inventory and status report shall provide, for each technology

(1) an assessment of its

(A) degree of technological maturity; and

(B) principal research, development, and demonstration issues, including

(i) the barriers posed by capital, operating, and maintenance costs;

(ii) technical performance; and

(iii) potential environmental impacts;

(2) the projected time frame for commercial availability, specifying at a minimum whether the technology will be commercially available in the near-term, mid-term, or long-term, whether there are too many uncertainties to project availability, or whether it is unlikely that the technology will ever be commercial; and

(3) a projection of the future cost-competitiveness of the technology in comparison with alternative technologies to provide the same energy service.
