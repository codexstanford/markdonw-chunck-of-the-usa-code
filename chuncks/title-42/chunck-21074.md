(A) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in the minimum allotment is being made; minus

(B) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for the immediately preceding fiscal year, bears to the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for such preceding fiscal year.
