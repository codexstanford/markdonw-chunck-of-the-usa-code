#### § 1962d–5e. Wetland areas
##### (a) Authorization of Secretary of the Army to plan and establish wetland areas; criteria for establishment

The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is authorized to plan and establish wetland areas as part of an authorized water resources development project under his jurisdiction. Establishment of any wetland area in connection with the dredging required for such a water resources development project may be undertaken in any case where the Chief of Engineers in his judgment finds that

(1) environmental, economic, and social benefits of the wetland area justifies the increased cost thereof above the cost required for alternative methods of disposing of dredged material for such project; and

(2) the increased cost of such wetland area will not exceed $400,000; and

(3) there is reasonable evidence that the wetland area to be established will not be substantially altered or destroyed by natural or man-made causes.
