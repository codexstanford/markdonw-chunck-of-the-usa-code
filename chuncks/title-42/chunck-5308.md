### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300mm–41. Payment of claims
##### (c) Health insurance coverage

(1) In general

In the case of an individual who has a WTC-related health condition that is not work-related and has health coverage for such condition through any public or private health plan (including health benefits under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.]) the provisions of section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b) ] shall apply to such a health plan and such individual in the same manner as they apply to group  1 health plan and an individual entitled to benefits under title XVIII of such Act pursuant to section 226(a) of such Act [ 42 U.S.C. 426(a) ]. Any costs for items and services covered under such plan that are not reimbursed by such health plan, due to the application of deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, other cost sharing, or otherwise, are reimbursable under this subchapter to the extent that they are covered under the WTC Program. The program under this subchapter shall not be treated as a legally liable party for purposes of applying section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25) ].

(2) Recovery by individual providers

Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as requiring an entity providing monitoring and treatment under this subchapter to seek reimbursement under a health plan with which the entity has no contract for reimbursement.

(3) Maintenance of required minimum essential coverage

No payment may be made for monitoring and treatment under this subchapter for an individual for a month (beginning with July 2014) if with respect to such month the individual

(A) is an applicable individual (as defined in subsection (d) of section 5000A of title 26 ) for whom the exemption under subsection (e) of such section does not apply; and

(B) is not covered under minimum essential coverage, as required under subsection (a) of such section.
