#### § 1395ss. Certification of medicare supplemental health insurance policies
##### (b) Standards and requirements; periodic review by Secretary

(1) Any medicare supplemental policy issued in any State which the Secretary determines has established under State law a regulatory program that

(A) provides for the application and enforcement of standards with respect to such policies equal to or more stringent than the NAIC Model Standards (as defined in subsection (g)(2)(A)), except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (H);

(B) includes requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements described in paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (c);

(C) provides that

(i) information with respect to the actual ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected under such policies will be reported to the State on forms conforming to those developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for such purpose, or

(ii) such ratios will be monitored under the program in an alternative manner approved by the Secretary, and that a copy of each such policy, the most recent premium for each such policy, and a listing of the ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected for the most recent 3-year period for each such policy issued or sold in the State is maintained and made available to interested persons;

(D) provides for application and enforcement of the standards and requirements described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to all medicare supplemental policies (as defined in subsection (g)(1)) issued in such State,

(E) provides the Secretary periodically (but at least annually) with a list containing the name and address of the issuer of each such policy and the name and number of each such policy (including an indication of policies that have been previously approved, newly approved, or withdrawn from approval since the previous list was provided),

(F) reports to the Secretary on the implementation and enforcement of standards and requirements of this paragraph at intervals established by the Secretary,

(G) provides for a process for approving or disapproving proposed premium increases with respect to such policies, and establishes a policy for the holding of public hearings prior to approval of a premium increase, and

(H) in the case of a policy that meets the standards under subparagraph (A) except that benefits under the policy are limited to items and services furnished by certain entities (or reduced benefits are provided when items or services are furnished by other entities), provides for the application of requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements under subsection (t), shall be deemed (subject to subsections (k)(3), (m), and (n), for so long as the Secretary finds that such State regulatory program continues to meet the standards and requirements of this paragraph) to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c). Each report required under subparagraph (F) shall include information on loss ratios of policies sold in the State, frequency and types of instances in which policies approved by the State fail to meet the standards and requirements of this paragraph, actions taken by the State to bring such policies into compliance, information regarding State programs implementing consumer protection provisions, and such further information as the Secretary in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may specify.

(2) The Secretary periodically shall review State regulatory programs to determine if they continue to meet the standards and requirements specified in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that a State regulatory program no longer meets the standards and requirements, before making a final determination, the Secretary shall provide the State an opportunity to adopt such a plan of correction as would permit the State regulatory program to continue to meet such standards and requirements. If the Secretary makes a final determination that the State regulatory program, after such an opportunity, fails to meet such standards and requirements, the program shall no longer be considered to have in operation a program meeting such standards and requirements.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a medicare supplemental policy offered in a State shall not be deemed to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c), with respect to an advertisement (whether through written, radio, or television medium) used (or, at a State’s option, to be used) for the policy in the State, unless the entity issuing the policy provides a copy of each advertisement to the Commissioner of Insurance (or comparable officer identified by the Secretary) of that State for review or approval to the extent it may be required under State law.
