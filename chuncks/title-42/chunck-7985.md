##### (b) Payments with respect to services; dialysis; regulations; physicians’ services; target reimbursement rates; home dialysis supplies and equipment; self-care home dialysis support services; self-care dialysis units; hepatitis B vaccine
######## (D) Such system

(i) shall include a payment adjustment based on case mix that may take into account patient weight, body mass index, comorbidities, length of time on dialysis, age, race, ethnicity, and other appropriate factors;

(ii) shall include a payment adjustment for high cost outliers due to unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care, including variations in the amount of erythropoiesis stimulating agents necessary for anemia management;

(iii) shall include a payment adjustment that reflects the extent to which costs incurred by low-volume facilities (as defined by the Secretary) in furnishing renal dialysis services exceed the costs incurred by other facilities in furnishing such services, and for payment for renal dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2011 , and before January 1, 2014 , such payment adjustment shall not be less than 10 percent; and

(iv) may include such other payment adjustments as the Secretary determines appropriate, such as a payment adjustment

(I) for pediatric providers of services and renal dialysis facilities;

(II) by a geographic index, such as the index referred to in paragraph (12)(D), as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and

(III) for providers of services or renal dialysis facilities located in rural areas. The Secretary shall take into consideration the unique treatment needs of children and young adults in establishing such system.

(E)

(i) The Secretary shall provide for a four-year phase-in (in equal increments) of the payment amount under the payment system under this paragraph, with such payment amount being fully implemented for renal dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2014 .

(ii) A provider of services or renal dialysis facility may make a one-time election to be excluded from the phase-in under clause (i) and be paid entirely based on the payment amount under the payment system under this paragraph. Such an election shall be made prior to January 1, 2011 , in a form and manner specified by the Secretary, and is final and may not be rescinded.

(iii) The Secretary shall make an adjustment to the payments under this paragraph for years during which the phase-in under clause (i) is applicable so that the estimated total amount of payments under this paragraph, including payments under this subparagraph, shall equal the estimated total amount of payments that would otherwise occur under this paragraph without such phase-in.

(F)

(i)

(I) Subject to subclauses (II) and (III) and clause (ii), beginning in 2012, the Secretary shall annually increase payment amounts established under this paragraph by an ESRD market basket percentage increase factor for a bundled payment system for renal dialysis services that reflects changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in renal dialysis services. In order to accomplish the purposes of subparagraph (I) with respect to 2016, 2017, and 2018, after determining the increase factor described in the preceding sentence for each of 2016, 2017, and 2018, the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor by 1.25 percentage points for each of 2016 and 2017 and by 1 percentage point for 2018.

(II) Subject to subclause (III), for 2012 and each subsequent year, after determining the increase factor described in subclause (I), the Secretary shall reduce such increase factor by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title . The application of the preceding sentence may result in such increase factor being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the payment system under this paragraph for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.

(III) Notwithstanding subclauses (I) and (II), in order to accomplish the purposes of subparagraph (I) with respect to 2015, the increase factor described in subclause (I) for 2015 shall be 0.0 percent pursuant to the regulation issued by the Secretary on December 2, 2013 , entitled “Medicare Program; End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, Quality Incentive Program, and Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies; Final Rule” (78 Fed. Reg. 72156).

(ii) For years during which a phase-in of the payment system pursuant to subparagraph (E) is applicable, the following rules shall apply to the portion of the payment under the system that is based on the payment of the composite rate that would otherwise apply if the system under this paragraph had not been enacted:

(I) The update under clause (i) shall not apply.

(II) Subject to clause (i)(II), the Secretary shall annually increase such composite rate by the ESRD market basket percentage increase factor described in clause (i)(I).

(G) There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title , section 1395 oo of this title, or otherwise of the determination of payment amounts under subparagraph (A), the establishment of an appropriate unit of payment under subparagraph (C), the identification of renal dialysis services included in the bundled payment, the adjustments under subparagraph (D), the application of the phase-in under subparagraph (E), and the establishment of the market basket percentage increase factors under subparagraph (F).
