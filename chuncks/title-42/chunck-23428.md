##### (c) Battery manufacturing and recycling grants

(1) In general

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021 , the Secretary shall establish within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy a battery manufacturing and recycling grant program (referred to in this subsection as the “program”).

(2) Purpose

Under the program, the Secretary shall award grants to eligible entities

(i) to carry out 1 or more demonstration projects for advanced battery component manufacturing, advanced battery manufacturing, and recycling;

(ii) to construct 1 or more new commercial-scale advanced battery component manufacturing, advanced battery manufacturing, or recycling facilities in the United States; and

(iii) to retool, retrofit, or expand 1 or more existing facilities located in the United States and determined qualified by the Secretary for advanced battery component manufacturing, advanced battery manufacturing, and recycling.

(B) Amount limitation

The amount of a grant awarded under the program shall be not less than

(i) $50,000,000 for an eligible entity carrying out 1 or more projects described in subparagraph (A)(i);

(II) is owned by a United States entity;

(III) deploys North American-owned intellectual property and content;

(IV) represents consortia or industry partnerships; and

(V)

(aa) if the eligible entity will use the grant for advanced battery component manufacturing, will not use battery material supplied by or originating from a foreign entity of concern; or

(bb) if the eligible entity will use the grant for battery recycling, will not export recovered critical materials to a foreign entity of concern; and

(ii) take into consideration whether a project

(I) provides workforce opportunities in low- and moderate-income or rural communities;

(II) provides workforce opportunities in communities that have lost jobs due to the displacements of fossil energy jobs;

(III) encourages partnership with universities and laboratories to spur innovation and drive down costs;

(IV) partners with Indian Tribes;

(V) takes into account

(aa) greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy efficient battery material processing opportunities throughout the manufacturing process; and

(bb) supply chain logistics; and

(VI) utilizes feedstock produced in the United States.

(4) Authorization of appropriations

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out the program $3,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, to remain available until expended.
