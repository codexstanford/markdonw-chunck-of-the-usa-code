#### § 286. National Library of Medicine
##### (e) Regional medical libraries; establishment

Whenever the Secretary, with the advice of the Board of Regents, determines that

(1) in any geographic area of the United States there is no regional medical library adequate to serve such area;

(2) under criteria prescribed for the administration of section 286b–6 of this title , there is a need for a regional medical library to serve such area; and

(3) because there is no medical library located in such area which, with financial assistance under section 286b–6 of this title , can feasibly be developed into a regional medical library adequate to serve such area, the Secretary may establish, as a branch of the Library, a regional medical library to serve the needs of such area.
