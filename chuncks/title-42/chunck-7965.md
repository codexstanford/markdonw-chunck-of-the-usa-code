##### (f) Presumption with respect to coverage denial; rebuttal; requirements; “fiscal intermediary” defined

(1) A home health agency which meets the applicable requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) shall be presumed to meet the requirement of subsection (a)(2).

(2) The presumption of paragraph (1) with respect to specific services may be rebutted by actual or imputed knowledge of the facts described in subsection (a)(2), including any of the following:

(A) Notice by the fiscal intermediary of the fact that payment may not be made under this subchapter with respect to the services.

(B) It is clear and obvious that the provider should have known at the time the services were furnished that they were excluded from coverage.

(3) The requirements of this paragraph are as follows:

(A) The agency complies with requirements of the Secretary under this subchapter respecting timely submittal of bills for payment and medical documentation.

(B) The agency program has reasonable procedures to notify promptly each patient (and the patient’s physician) where it is determined that a patient is being or will be furnished items or services which are excluded from coverage under this subchapter.

(4)

(A) The requirement of this paragraph is that, on the basis of bills submitted by a home health agency during the previous quarter, the rate of denial of bills for the agency by reason of a coverage denial described in subsection (g) does not exceed 2.5 percent, computed based on visits for home health services billed.

(B) For purposes of determining the rate of denial of bills for a home health agency under subparagraph (A), a bill shall not be considered to be denied until the expiration of the 60-day period that begins on the date such bill is denied by the fiscal intermediary, or, with respect to such a denial for which the agency requests reconsideration, until the fiscal intermediary issues a decision denying payment for such bill.

(5) In this subsection, the term “fiscal intermediary” means, with respect to a home health agency, an agency or organization with an agreement under section 1395h of this title with respect to the agency.

(6) The Secretary shall monitor the proportion of denied bills submitted by home health agencies for which reconsideration is requested, and shall notify Congress if the proportion of denials reversed upon reconsideration increases significantly.
