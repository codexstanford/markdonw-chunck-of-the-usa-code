#### § 7651c. Phase I sulfur dioxide requirements
##### (e) Allocation of allowances

(1) In the case of a unit that receives authorization from the Governor of the State in which such unit is located to make reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide prior to calendar year 1995 and that is part of a utility system that meets the following requirements: (A) the total coal-fired generation within the utility system as a percentage of total system generation decreased by more than 20 percent between January 1, 1980 , and December 31, 1985 ; and (B) the weighted capacity factor of all coal-fired units within the utility system averaged over the period from January 1, 1985 , through December 31, 1987 , was below 50 percent, the Administrator shall allocate allowances under this paragraph for the unit pursuant to this subsection. The Administrator shall allocate allowances for a unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section 7651d of this title (but is not also an affected unit under this section) and part of a utility system that includes 1 or more affected units under section 7651d of this title for reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide made during the period 1995–1999 if the unit meets the requirements of this subsection and the requirements of the preceding sentence, except that for the purposes of applying this subsection to any such unit, the prior year concerned as specified below, shall be any year after January 1, 1995 but prior to January 1, 2000 .

(2) In the case of an affected unit under this section described in subparagraph (A), 4 the allowances allocated under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the amount which (A) the product of the unit’s baseline multiplied by the unit’s 1985 actual sulfur dioxide emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu), divided by 2,000, exceeds (B) the allowances specified for such unit in Table A. In the case of an affected unit under section 7651d of this title described in subparagraph (A), 4 the allowances awarded under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the amount by which (i) the product of the quantity of fossil fuel consumed by the unit (in mmBtu) in the prior year multiplied by the lesser of 2.50 or the most stringent emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu) applicable to the unit under the applicable implementation plan, divided by 2,000, exceeds (ii) the unit’s actual tonnage of sulfur dioxide emission for the prior year concerned. Allowances allocated under this subsection for units referred to in subparagraph (A)  4 may be allocated only for emission reductions achieved as a result of physical changes or changes in the method of operation made after November 15, 1990 , including changes in the type or quality of fossil fuel consumed.

(3) In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph  5 be interpreted as an event of force majeur  6 or a commercial impractibility  7 or in any other way as a basis for excused nonperformance by a utility system under a coal sales contract in effect before November 15, 1990 .
