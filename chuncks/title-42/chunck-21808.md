##### (b) Definitions

In this part:

(1) Advanced nuclear reactor

The term “advanced nuclear reactor” means

(A) a nuclear fission reactor, including a prototype plant (as defined in sections 50.2 and 52.1 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)), with significant improvements compared to reactors operating on December 27, 2020 , including improvements such as

(i) additional inherent safety features;

(ii) lower waste yields;

(iii) improved fuel and material performance;

(iv) increased tolerance to loss of fuel cooling;

(v) enhanced reliability or improved resilience;

(vi) increased proliferation resistance;

(vii) increased thermal efficiency;

(viii) reduced consumption of cooling water and other environmental impacts;

(ix) the ability to integrate into electric applications and nonelectric applications;

(x) modular sizes to allow for deployment that corresponds with the demand for electricity or process heat; and

(xi) operational flexibility to respond to changes in demand for electricity or process heat and to complement integration with intermittent renewable energy or energy storage;

(B) a fusion reactor; and

(C) a radioisotope power system that utilizes heat from radioactive decay to generate energy.

(2) Commission

The term “Commission” means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

(3) Fast neutron

The term “fast neutron” means a neutron with kinetic energy above 100 kiloelectron volts.

(4) National Laboratory

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “National Laboratory” has the meaning given the term in section 15801 of this title .

(B) Limitation

With respect to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Sandia National Laboratories, the term “National Laboratory” means only the civilian activities of the laboratory.

(5) Neutron flux

The term “neutron flux” means the intensity of neutron radiation measured as a rate of flow of neutrons applied over an area.

(6) Neutron source

The term “neutron source” means a research machine that provides neutron irradiation services for

(A) research on materials sciences and nuclear physics; and

(B) testing of advanced materials, nuclear fuels, and other related components for reactor systems.
