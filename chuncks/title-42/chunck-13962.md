The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown and subject to the provisions of rule 65(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to restrain violations of this chapter, or to restrain the sale, offer for sale, or the importation into the United States, of any manufactured home which is determined, prior to the first purchase of such manufactured home in good faith for purposes other than resale, not to conform to applicable Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards prescribed pursuant to this chapter or to contain a defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard, upon petition by the appropriate United States attorney or the Attorney General on behalf of the United States. Whenever practicable, the Secretary shall give notice to any person against whom an action for injunctive relief is contemplated and afford him an opportunity to present his views and the failure to give such notice and afford such opportunity shall not preclude the granting of appropriate relief.
