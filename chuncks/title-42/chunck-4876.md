#### § 300gg–3. Prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions or other discrimination based on health status
##### (g) Use of affiliation period by HMOs as alternative to preexisting condition exclusion

(1) In general

A health maintenance organization which offers health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan and which does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion allowed under subsection (a) with respect to any particular coverage option may impose an affiliation period for such coverage option, but only if

(A) such period is applied uniformly without regard to any health status-related factors; and

(B) such period does not exceed 2 months (or 3 months in the case of a late enrollee).

(2) Affiliation period

(A) “Affiliation period” defined

For purposes of this subchapter, the term “affiliation period” means a period which, under the terms of the health insurance coverage offered by the health maintenance organization, must expire before the health insurance coverage becomes effective. The organization is not required to provide health care services or benefits during such period and no premium shall be charged to the participant or beneficiary for any coverage during the period.

(B) Beginning

Such period shall begin on the enrollment date.

(C) Runs concurrently with waiting periods

An affiliation period under a plan shall run concurrently with any waiting period under the plan.

(3) Alternative methods

A health maintenance organization described in paragraph (1) may use alternative methods, from those described in such paragraph, to address adverse selection as approved by the State insurance commissioner or official or officials designated by the State to enforce the requirements of this part for the State involved with respect to such issuer.
