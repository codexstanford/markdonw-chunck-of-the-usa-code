##### (d) Direct grants to low-income members of Indian tribal organizations or alternate service organizations; application for funds

(1) Reservation of amounts

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B) and notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary shall reserve from amounts that would otherwise be allocated to a State under this part not less than 100 percent, but not more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the same proportion to the allocation of that State for the applicable fiscal year as the population of all low-income members of an Indian tribe in that State bears to the population of all low-income individuals in that State.

(B) Restrictions

Subparagraph (A) shall apply only if

(i) the tribal organization serving the low-income members of the applicable Indian tribe requests that the Secretary make a grant directly; and

(ii) the Secretary determines that the low-income members of the applicable Indian tribe would be equally or better served by making a grant directly than a grant made to the State in which the low-income members reside.

(C) Presumption

If the tribal organization requesting the grant is a tribally designated housing entity (as defined in section 4103 of title 25 ) that has operated without material audit exceptions (or without any material audit exceptions that were not corrected within a 3-year period), the Secretary shall presume that the low-income members of the applicable Indian tribe would be equally or better served by making a grant directly to the tribal organization than by a grant made to the State in which the low-income members reside.

(2) Administration

The amounts reserved by the Secretary under this subsection shall be granted to the tribal organization serving the low-income members of the Indian tribe, or, where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as the Secretary determines has the capacity to provide services pursuant to this part.

(3) Application

In order for a tribal organization or other entity to be eligible for a grant for a fiscal year under this subsection, it shall submit to the Secretary an application meeting the requirements set forth in section 6864 of this title .
