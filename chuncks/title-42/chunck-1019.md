#### § 256e. Program of payments to children’s hospitals that operate graduate medical education programs
##### (e) Making of payments

(1) Interim payments

The Secretary shall determine, before the beginning of each fiscal year involved for which payments may be made for a hospital under this section, the amounts of the payments for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education for such fiscal year and shall (subject to paragraph (2)) make the payments of such amounts in 12 equal interim installments during such period. Such interim payments to each individual hospital shall be based on the number of residents reported in the hospital’s most recently filed Medicare cost report prior to the application date for the Federal fiscal year for which the interim payment amounts are established. In the case of a hospital that does not report residents on a Medicare cost report, such interim payments shall be based on the number of residents trained during the hospital’s most recently completed Medicare cost report filing period.

(2) Withholding

The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1) as necessary to ensure a hospital will not be overpaid on an interim basis.

(3) Reconciliation

Prior to the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount payable to the hospital for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made and pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary determination for the purposes of section 1395 oo of this title and shall be subject to administrative and judicial review under that section in the same manner as the amount of payment under section 1395ww(d)  1 of this title is subject to review under such section.
