#### § 6313. Standards
##### (b) Electric motors
######## (A) The Secretary may, by rule, provide that the standards specified in paragraph (1) shall not apply to certain types or classes of electric motors if

(i) compliance with such standards would not result in significant energy savings because such motors cannot be used in most general purpose applications or are very unlikely to be used in most general purpose applications; and

(ii) standards for such motors would not be technologically feasible or economically justified.

(B) Not later than one year after October 24, 1992 , a manufacturer seeking an exemption under this paragraph with respect to a type or class of electric motor developed on or before October 24, 1992 , shall submit a petition to the Secretary requesting such exemption. Such petition shall include evidence that the type or class of motor meets the criteria for exemption specified in subparagraph (A).

(C) Not later than two years after October 24, 1992 , the Secretary shall rule on each petition for exemption submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B). In making such ruling, the Secretary shall afford an opportunity for public comment.

(D) Manufacturers of types or classes of motors developed after October 24, 1992 , to which standards under paragraph (1) would be applicable may petition the Secretary for exemptions from compliance with such standards based on the criteria specified in subparagraph (A).

(4)

(A) The Secretary shall publish a final rule no later than the end of the 24-month period beginning on the effective date of the standards established under paragraph (1) to determine if such standards should be amended. Such rule shall provide that any amendment shall apply to electric motors manufactured on or after a date which is five years after the effective date of the standards established under paragraph (1).
