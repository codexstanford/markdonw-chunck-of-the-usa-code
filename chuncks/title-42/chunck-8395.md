### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396d. Definitions
##### (l) Rural health clinics
######## (B) The term “freestanding birth center” means a health facility

(i) that is not a hospital;

(ii) where childbirth is planned to occur away from the pregnant woman’s residence;

(iii) that is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide prenatal labor and delivery or postpartum care and other ambulatory services that are included in the plan; and

(iv) that complies with such other requirements relating to the health and safety of individuals furnished services by the facility as the State shall establish.

(C) A State shall provide separate payments to providers administering prenatal labor and delivery or postpartum care in a freestanding birth center (as defined in subparagraph (B)), such as nurse midwives and other providers of services such as birth attendants recognized under State law, as determined appropriate by the Secretary. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “birth attendant” means an individual who is recognized or registered by the State involved to provide health care at childbirth and who provides such care within the scope of practice under which the individual is legally authorized to perform such care under State law (or the State regulatory mechanism provided by State law), regardless of whether the individual is under the supervision of, or associated with, a physician or other health care provider. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as changing State law requirements applicable to a birth attendant.
