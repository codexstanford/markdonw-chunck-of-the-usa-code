### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (t) Payments to encourage adoption and use of certified EHR technology
######## (A) In no case shall the payments described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(B) exceed

(i) in the aggregate the product of

(I) the overall hospital EHR amount for the provider computed under subparagraph (B); and

(II) the Medicaid share for such provider computed under subparagraph (C);

(ii) in any year 50 percent of the product described in clause (i); and

(iii) in any 2-year period 90 percent of such product.

(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the overall hospital EHR amount, with respect to a Medicaid provider, is the sum of the applicable amounts specified in section 1395ww(n)(2)(A) of this title for such provider for the first 4 payment years (as estimated by the Secretary) determined as if the Medicare share specified in clause (ii) of such section were 1. The Secretary shall establish, in consultation with the State, the overall hospital EHR amount for each such Medicaid provider eligible for payments under paragraph (1)(B). For purposes of this subparagraph in computing the amounts under section 1395ww(n)(2)(C) of this title for payment years after the first payment year, the Secretary shall assume that in subsequent payment years discharges increase at the average annual rate of growth of the most recent 3 years for which discharge data are available per year.

(C) The Medicaid share computed under this subparagraph, for a Medicaid provider for a period specified by the Secretary, shall be calculated in the same manner as the Medicare share under section 1395ww(n)(2)(D) of this title for such a hospital and period, except that there shall be substituted for the numerator under clause (i) of such section the amount that is equal to the number of inpatient-bed-days (as established by the Secretary) which are attributable to individuals who are receiving medical assistance under this subchapter and who are not described in section 1395ww(n)(2)(D)(i) of this title . In computing inpatient-bed-days under the previous sentence, the Secretary shall take into account inpatient-bed-days attributable to inpatient-bed-days that are paid for individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under subsection (m) or section 1396u–2 of this title ).
