(1) Establishment

(A) In general

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the Secretary shall establish a hospital value-based purchasing program (in this subsection referred to as the “Program”) under which value-based incentive payments are made in a fiscal year to hospitals that meet the performance standards under paragraph (3) for the performance period for such fiscal year (as established under paragraph (4)).

(B) Program to begin in fiscal year 2013

The Program shall apply to payments for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012 .

(C) Applicability of Program to hospitals

(i) In general

For purposes of this subsection, subject to clause (ii), the term “hospital” means a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in subsection (d)(1)(B)).

(ii) Exclusions

The term “hospital” shall not include, with respect to a fiscal year, a hospital

(I) that is subject to the payment reduction under subsection (b)(3)(B)(viii)(I) for such fiscal year;

(II) for which, during the performance period for such fiscal year, the Secretary has cited deficiencies that pose immediate jeopardy to the health or safety of patients;

(III) for which there are not a minimum number (as determined by the Secretary) of measures that apply to the hospital for the performance period for such fiscal year; or

(IV) for which there are not a minimum number (as determined by the Secretary) of cases for the measures that apply to the hospital for the performance period for such fiscal year.

For purposes of determining the minimum numbers under subclauses (III) and (IV) of clause (ii), the Secretary shall have conducted an independent analysis of what numbers are appropriate.

(iv) Exemption

In the case of a hospital that is paid under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title , the Secretary may exempt such hospital from the application of this subsection if the State which is paid under such section submits an annual report to the Secretary describing how a similar program in the State for a participating hospital or hospitals achieves or surpasses the measured results in terms of patient health outcomes and cost savings established under this subsection.

(2) Measures

(A) In general

The Secretary shall select measures, other than measures of readmissions, for purposes of the Program. Such measures shall be selected from the measures specified under subsection (b)(3)(B)(viii).

(I) Conditions or procedures

Measures are selected under subparagraph (A) that cover at least the following 5 specific conditions or procedures:

(aa) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

(bb) Heart failure.

(cc) Pneumonia.

(dd) Surgeries, as measured by the Surgical Care Improvement Project (formerly referred to as “Surgical Infection Prevention” for discharges occurring before July 2006).

For value-based incentive payments made with respect to discharges occurring during fiscal year 2014 or a subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall ensure that measures selected under subparagraph (A) include efficiency measures, including measures of “Medicare spending per beneficiary”. Such measures shall be adjusted for factors such as age, sex, race, severity of illness, and other factors that the Secretary determines appropriate.

(iii) HCAHPS pain questions

The Secretary may not include under subparagraph (A) a measure that is based on the questions appearing on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey in 2018 or 2019 about communication by hospital staff with an individual about the individual’s pain.

(C) Limitations

(C) Timing

The Secretary shall establish and announce the performance standards under subparagraph (A) not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of the performance period for the fiscal year involved.

(D) Considerations in establishing standards

In establishing performance standards with respect to measures under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account appropriate factors, such as

(i) practical experience with the measures involved, including whether a significant proportion of hospitals failed to meet the performance standard during previous performance periods;

(iii) improvement rates; and

(iv) the opportunity for continued improvement.

(4) Performance period

For purposes of the Program, the Secretary shall establish the performance period for a fiscal year. Such performance period shall begin and end prior to the beginning of such fiscal year.

(5) Hospital performance score

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall develop a methodology for assessing the total performance of each hospital based on performance standards with respect to the measures selected under paragraph (2) for a performance period (as established under paragraph (4)). Using such methodology, the Secretary shall provide for an assessment (in this subsection referred to as the “hospital performance score”) for each hospital for each performance period.

(B) Application

(i) Appropriate distribution

The Secretary shall ensure that the application of the methodology developed under subparagraph (A) results in an appropriate distribution of value-based incentive payments under paragraph (6) among hospitals achieving different levels of hospital performance scores, with hospitals achieving the highest hospital performance scores receiving the largest value-based incentive payments.

(B) Value-based incentive payment amount

The value-based incentive payment amount for each discharge of a hospital in a fiscal year shall be equal to the product of

(i) the base operating DRG payment amount (as defined in paragraph (7)(D)) for the discharge for the hospital for such fiscal year; and

(ii) the value-based incentive payment percentage specified under subparagraph (C) for the hospital for such fiscal year.

(C) Value-based incentive payment percentage

In specifying the value-based incentive payment percentage for each hospital for a fiscal year under clause (i), the Secretary shall ensure that

(I) such percentage is based on the hospital performance score of the hospital under paragraph (5); and

(II) the total amount of value-based incentive payments under this paragraph to all hospitals in such fiscal year is equal to the total amount available for value-based incentive payments for such fiscal year under paragraph (7)(A), as estimated by the Secretary.

(7) Funding for value-based incentive payments

(A) Amount

The total amount available for value-based incentive payments under paragraph (6) for all hospitals for a fiscal year shall be equal to the total amount of reduced payments for all hospitals under subparagraph (B) for such fiscal year, as estimated by the Secretary.

(i) In general

The Secretary shall reduce the base operating DRG payment amount (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for a hospital for each discharge in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2013) by an amount equal to the applicable percent (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the base operating DRG payment amount for the discharge for the hospital for such fiscal year. The Secretary shall make such reductions for all hospitals in the fiscal year involved, regardless of whether or not the hospital has been determined by the Secretary to have earned a value-based incentive payment under paragraph (6) for such fiscal year.

(ii) No effect on other payments

Payments described in items (aa) and (bb) of subparagraph (D)(i)(II) for a hospital shall be determined as if this subsection had not been enacted.
