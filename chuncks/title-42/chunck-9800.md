### CHAPTER 13— SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS
#### § 1766. Child and adult care food program
##### (o) Participation of older persons and chronically impaired disabled persons

(1) For purposes of this section, adult day care centers shall be considered eligible institutions for reimbursement for meals or supplements served to persons 60 years of age or older or to chronically impaired disabled persons, including victims of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders with neurological and organic brain dysfunction. Reimbursement provided to such institutions for such purposes shall improve the quality of meals or level of services provided or increase participation in the program. Lunches served by each such institution for which reimbursement is claimed under this section shall provide, on the average, approximately ⅓ of the daily recommended dietary allowance established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. Such institutions shall make reasonable efforts to serve meals that meet the special dietary requirements of participants, including efforts to serve foods in forms palatable to participants.

(2) For purposes of this subsection

(A) the term “adult day care center” means any public agency or private nonprofit organization, or any proprietary title XIX or title XX center, which

(i) is licensed or approved by Federal, State, or local authorities to provide adult day care services to chronically impaired disabled adults or persons 60 years of age or older in a group setting outside their homes, or a group living arrangement, on a less than 24-hour basis; and

(ii) provides for such care and services directly or under arrangements made by the agency or organization whereby the agency or organization maintains professional management responsibility for all such services; and

(B) the term “proprietary title XIX or title XX center” means any private, for-profit center providing adult day care services for which it receives compensation from amounts granted to the States under title XIX or XX of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 1397 et seq.] and which title XIX or title XX beneficiaries were not less than 25 percent of enrolled eligible participants in a calendar month preceding initial application or annual reapplication for program participation.

(3)

(A) The Secretary, in consulation  2 with the Assistant Secretary for Aging, shall establish, within 6 months of October 1, 1988 , separate guidelines for reimbursement of institutions described in this subsection. Such reimbursement shall take into account the nutritional requirements of eligible persons, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of tested nutritional research, except that such reimbursement shall not be less than would otherwise be required under this section.

(B) The guidelines shall contain provisions designed to assure that reimbursement under this subsection shall not duplicate reimbursement under part C of title III of the Older Americans Act of 1965 [ 42 U.S.C. 3030e et seq.], for the same meal served.

(4) For the purpose of establishing eligibility for free or reduced price meals or supplements under this subsection, income shall include only the income of an eligible person and, if any, the spouse and dependents with whom the eligible person resides.

(5) A person described in paragraph (1) shall be considered automatically eligible for free meals or supplements under this subsection, without further application or eligibility determination, if the person is

(A) a member of a household receiving assistance under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 ( 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.); or

(B) a recipient of assistance under title XVI or XIX of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq., 1396 et seq.].

(6) The Governor of any State may designate to administer the program under this subsection a State agency other than the agency that administers the child care food program under this section.
