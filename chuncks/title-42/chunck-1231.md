(i) Making information available to the general public, including information describing the needs of patients with respect to donors of bone marrow.

(ii) Educating and providing information to individuals who are willing to serve as potential bone marrow donors.

(iii) Training individuals in requesting individuals to serve as potential bone marrow donors.
