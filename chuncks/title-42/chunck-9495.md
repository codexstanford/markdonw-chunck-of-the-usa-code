(1) Indemnification

If the Secretary determines that a loan guaranteed by an eligible lender pursuant to delegation of authority under subsection (h) was not originated in accordance with the requirements under this section and the Secretary pays a claim under the guarantee for the loan, the Secretary may require the eligible lender authorized under subsection (h) to issue the guarantee certificate for the loan

(A) to indemnify the Secretary for the loss, if the payment under the guarantee was made within a reasonable period specified by the Secretary; or

(B) to indemnify the Secretary for the loss regardless of when payment under the guarantee was made, if the Secretary determines that fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination of the loan.

(2) Termination of authority to issue guarantees

The Secretary may cancel a delegation of authority under subsection (h) to an eligible lender if the Secretary determines that the lender has violated the requirements and procedures for guaranteed loans under this section or for other good cause. Any such cancellation shall be made by giving notice to the eligible lender and shall take effect upon receipt of the notice by the mortgagee or at a later date, as the Secretary may provide. A decision by the Secretary to cancel a delegation shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to judicial review.
