##### (b) Program to collect information on fraud and abuse

(1) Establishment of program

Not later than 3 months after August 21, 1996 , the Secretary shall establish a program under which the Secretary shall encourage individuals to report to the Secretary information on individuals and entities who are engaging in or who have engaged in acts or omissions which constitute grounds for the imposition of a sanction under section 1320a–7, 1320a–7a, or 1320a–7b of this title, or who have otherwise engaged in fraud and abuse against the Medicare program under this subchapter for which there is a sanction provided under law. The program shall discourage provision of, and not consider, information which is frivolous or otherwise not relevant or material to the imposition of such a sanction.

(2) Payment of portion of amounts collected

If an individual reports information to the Secretary under the program established under paragraph (1) which serves as the basis for the collection by the Secretary or the Attorney General of any amount of at least $100 (other than any amount paid as a penalty under section 1320a–7b of this title ), the Secretary may pay a portion of the amount collected to the individual (under procedures similar to those applicable under section 7623 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to payments to individuals providing information on violations of such Code).
