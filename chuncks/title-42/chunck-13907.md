#### § 5318. Urban development action grants
##### (d) Mandatory selection criteria; award of points; distribution of funds; number of competitions per year; use of distress conditions data by urban counties
######## (B) Each competition for grants described in any clause of subparagraph (A) shall be for an amount equal to the sum of

(i) approximately the amount of the funds available for such grants for the fiscal year divided by the number of competitions for those funds;

(ii) any funds available for such grants in any previous competition that are not awarded; and

(iii) any funds available for such grants in any previous competition that are recaptured.

(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in each competition for grants under this section, no city or urban county may be awarded a grant or grants in an amount in excess of $10,000,000 until all cities and urban counties which submitted fundable applications have been awarded a grant. If funds are available for additional grants after each city and urban county submitting a fundable application is awarded one or more grants under the preceding sentence, then additional grants shall be made so that each city or urban county that has submitted multiple applications is awarded one additional grant in order of ranking, with no single city or urban county receiving more than one grant approval in any subsequent series of grant determinations within the same competition.

(D) All grants under this section, including grants to cities and urban counties described in subsection (b)(2), shall be awarded in accordance with subparagraph (C) so that all grants under this section are made in order of ranking.
