### CHAPTER 104— NUCLEAR SAFETY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION
#### § 9701. Congressional findings and declaration of policy
###### (a) The Congress finds that

(1) nuclear energy is one of the two major energy sources available for electric energy production in the United States during the balance of the twentieth century;

(2) continued development of nuclear power is dependent upon maintaining an extremely high level of safety in the operation of nuclear plants, and on public recognition that these facilities do not constitute a significant threat to human health or safety;

(3) it is the responsibility of utilities, as owners and operators of nuclear powerplants, to assure that such plants are designed and operated safely and reliably; and

(4) a proper role of the Federal Government in assuring nuclear powerplant safety, in addition to its regulatory function, is the conduct of a research, development, and demonstration program to provide important scientific and technical information which can contribute to sound design and safe operation of these plants.
