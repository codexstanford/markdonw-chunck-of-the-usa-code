### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–5. Public reporting of performance information
##### (h) Financial incentives to encourage consumers to choose high quality providers

The Secretary may establish a demonstration program, not later than January 1, 2019 , to provide financial incentives to Medicare beneficiaries who are furnished services by high quality physicians, as determined by the Secretary based on factors in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of subsection (a)(2). In no case may Medicare beneficiaries be required to pay increased premiums or cost sharing or be subject to a reduction in benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act as a result of such demonstration program. The Secretary shall ensure that any such demonstration program does not disadvantage those beneficiaries without reasonable access to high performing physicians or create financial inequities under such title.
