##### (d) Smart grid functions

The term “smart grid functions” means any of the following:

(1) The ability to develop, store, send and receive digital information concerning electricity use, costs, prices, time of use, nature of use, storage, or other information relevant to device, grid, or utility operations, to or from or by means of the electric utility system, through one or a combination of devices and technologies.

(2) The ability to develop, store, send and receive digital information concerning electricity use, costs, prices, time of use, nature of use, storage, or other information relevant to device, grid, or utility operations to or from a computer or other control device.

(3) The ability to measure or monitor electricity use as a function of time of day, power quality characteristics such as voltage level, current, cycles per second, or source or type of generation and to store, synthesize or report that information by digital means.

(4) The ability to sense and localize disruptions or changes in power flows on the grid and communicate such information instantaneously and automatically for purposes of enabling automatic protective responses to sustain reliability and security of grid operations.

(5) The ability to detect, prevent, communicate with regard to, respond to, or recover from system security threats, including cyber-security threats and terrorism, using digital information, media, and devices.

(6) The ability of any appliance or machine to respond to such signals, measurements, or communications automatically or in a manner programmed by its owner or operator without independent human intervention.

(7) The ability to use digital information to operate functionalities on the electric utility grid that were previously electro-mechanical or manual.

(8) The ability to use digital controls to manage and modify electricity demand, enable congestion management, assist in voltage control, provide operating reserves, and provide frequency regulation.

(9) The ability to use data analytics and software-as-service to provide flexibility by improving the visibility of the electrical system to grid operators that can help quickly rebalance the electrical system with autonomous controls.

(10) The ability to facilitate the aggregation or integration of distributed energy resources to serve as assets for the grid.

(11) The ability to provide energy storage to meet fluctuating electricity demand, provide voltage support, and integrate intermittent generation sources, including vehicle-to-grid technologies.

(12) The ability of hardware, software, and associated protocols applied to existing transmission facilities to increase the operational transfer capacity of a transmission network.

(13) The ability to anticipate and mitigate impacts of extreme weather or natural disasters on grid resiliency.

(14) The ability to facilitate the integration of renewable energy resources, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and vehicle-to-grid technologies.

(15) The ability to reliably meet increased demand from electric vehicles and the electrification of appliances and other sectors.

(16) Such other functions as the Secretary may identify as being necessary or useful to the operation of a Smart Grid.
