##### (b) Mix of energy sources

(1) In general

Not later than 1 year after November 15, 2021 , the Administrator shall establish, in accordance with section 18777 of this title and this subsection and to the extent the Administrator determines to be appropriate, a system to harmonize the operating data on electricity generation collected under subsection (a) with

The system established under paragraph (1) shall result in an integrated dataset that includes, for any given time

(A) the net generation of electricity by megawatt hour within the metered boundaries of each balancing authority; and

(B) where available, the average and marginal greenhouse gas emissions by megawatt hour of electricity generated within the metered boundaries of each balancing authority.

(3) Real-time data dissemination

To the maximum extent practicable, the system established under paragraph (1) shall disseminate data

(A) on a real-time basis; and

(B) through an application programming interface that is publicly accessible.
