### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 263a. Certification of laboratories
##### (f) Standards

(1) In general

The Secretary shall issue standards to assure consistent performance by laboratories issued a certificate under this section of valid and reliable laboratory examinations and other procedures. Such standards shall require each laboratory issued a certificate under this section

(A) to maintain a quality assurance and quality control program adequate and appropriate for the validity and reliability of the laboratory examinations and other procedures of the laboratory and to meet requirements relating to the proper collection, transportation, and storage of specimens and the reporting of results,

(B) to maintain records, equipment, and facilities necessary for the proper and effective operation of the laboratory,

(C) in performing and carrying out its laboratory examinations and other procedures, to use only personnel meeting such qualifications as the Secretary may establish for the direction, supervision, and performance of examinations and procedures within the laboratory, which qualifications shall take into consideration competency, training, experience, job performance, and education and which qualifications shall, as appropriate, be different on the basis of the type of examinations and procedures being performed by the laboratory and the risks and consequences of erroneous results associated with such examinations and procedures,

(D) to qualify under a proficiency testing program meeting the standards established by the Secretary under paragraph (3), and

(E) to meet such other requirements as the Secretary determines necessary to assure consistent performance by such laboratories of accurate and reliable laboratory examinations and procedures.

(2) Considerations

In developing the standards to be issued under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, within the flexibility provided under subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1), take into consideration

(A) the examinations and procedures performed and the methodologies employed,

(B) the degree of independent judgment involved,

(C) the amount of interpretation involved,

(D) the difficulty of the calculations involved,

(E) the calibration and quality control requirements of the instruments used,

(F) the type of training required to operate the instruments used in the methodology, and

(G) such other factors as the Secretary considers relevant.

(3) Proficiency testing program

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish standards for the proficiency testing programs for laboratories issued a certificate under this section which are conducted by the Secretary, conducted by an organization approved under subparagraph (C), or conducted by an approved accrediting body. The standards shall require that a laboratory issued a certificate under this section be tested for each examination and procedure conducted within a category of examinations or procedures for which it has received a certificate, except for examinations and procedures for which the Secretary has determined that a proficiency test cannot reasonably be developed. The testing shall be conducted on a quarterly basis, except where the Secretary determines for technical and scientific reasons that a particular examination or procedure may be tested less frequently (but not less often than twice per year).

(B) Criteria

The standards established under subparagraph (A) shall include uniform criteria for acceptable performance under a proficiency testing program, based on the available technology and the clinical relevance of the laboratory examination or other procedure subject to such program. The criteria shall be established for all examinations and procedures and shall be uniform for each examination and procedure. The standards shall also include a system for grading proficiency testing performance to determine whether a laboratory has performed acceptably for a particular quarter and acceptably for a particular examination or procedure or category of examination or procedure over a period of successive quarters.

(C) Approved proficiency testing programs

For the purpose of administering proficiency testing programs which meet the standards established under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall approve a proficiency testing program offered by a private nonprofit organization or a State if the program meets the standards established under subparagraph (A) and the organization or State provides technical assistance to laboratories seeking to qualify under the program. The Secretary shall evaluate each program approved under this subparagraph annually to determine if the program continues to meet the standards established under subparagraph (A) and shall withdraw the approval of any program that no longer meets such standards.

(D) Onsite testing

The Secretary shall perform, or shall direct a program approved under subparagraph (C) to perform, onsite proficiency testing to assure compliance with the requirements of subsection (d)(5). The Secretary shall perform, on an onsite or other basis, proficiency testing to evaluate the performance of a proficiency testing program approved under subparagraph (C) and to assure quality performance by a laboratory.

(E) Training, technical assistance, and enhanced proficiency testing

The Secretary may, in lieu of or in addition to actions authorized under subsection (h), (i), or (j), require any laboratory which fails to perform acceptably on an individual examination and procedure or a category of examination and procedures

(i) to undertake training and to obtain the necessary technical assistance to meet the requirements of the proficency  2 testing program,

(ii) to enroll in a program of enhanced proficiency testing, or

(iii) to undertake any combination of the training, technical assistance, or testing described in clauses (i) and (ii).

(F) Testing results

The Secretary shall establish a system to make the results of the proficiency testing programs subject to the standards established by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) available, on a reasonable basis, upon request of any person. The Secretary shall include with results made available under this subparagraph such explanatory information as may be appropriate to assist in the interpretation of such results.

(4) National standards for quality assurance in cytology services

(A) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish national standards for quality assurance in cytology services designed to assure consistent performance by laboratories of valid and reliable cytological services.

(B) Standards

The standards established under subparagraph (A) shall include

(i) the maximum number of cytology slides that any individual may screen in a 24-hour period,

(ii) requirements that a clinical laboratory maintain a record of (I) the number of cytology slides screened during each 24-hour period by each individual who examines cytology slides for the laboratory, and (II) the number of hours devoted during each 24-hour period to screening cytology slides by such individual,

(iii) criteria for requiring rescreening of cytological preparations, such as (I) random rescreening of cytology specimens determined to be in the benign category, (II) focused rescreening of such preparations in high risk groups, and (III) for each abnormal cytological result, rescreening of all prior cytological specimens for the patient, if available,

(iv) periodic confirmation and evaluation of the proficiency of individuals involved in screening or interpreting cytological preparations, including announced and unannounced on-site proficiency testing of such individuals, with such testing to take place, to the extent practicable, under normal working conditions,

(v) procedures for detecting inadequately prepared slides, for assuring that no cytological diagnosis is rendered on such slides, and for notifying referring physicians of such slides,

(vi) requirements that all cytological screening be done on the premises of a laboratory that is certified under this section,

(vii) requirements for the retention of cytology slides by laboratories for such periods of time as the Secretary considers appropriate, and

(viii) standards requiring periodic inspection of cytology services by persons capable of evaluating the quality of cytology services.
