### CHAPTER 8— LOW-INCOME HOUSING
#### § 1437d. Contract provisions and requirements; loans and annual contributions
##### (j) Performance indicators for public housing agencies

(1) The Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register indicators to assess the management performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations. The indicators shall be established by rule under section 553 of title 5 . Such indicators shall enable the Secretary to evaluate the performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations in all major areas of management operations. The Secretary shall, in particular, use the following indicators for public housing agencies, to the extent practicable:

(A) The number and percentage of vacancies within an agency’s inventory, including the progress that an agency has made within the previous 3 years to reduce such vacancies.

(B) The amount and percentage of funds provided to the public housing agency from the Capital Fund under section 1437g(d) of this title which remain unobligated by the public housing agency after 3 years.

(C) The percentage of rents uncollected.

(D) The utility consumption (with appropriate adjustments to reflect different regions and unit sizes).

(E) The average period of time that an agency requires to repair and turn-around vacant units.

(F) The proportion of maintenance work orders outstanding, including any progress that an agency has made during the preceding 3 years to reduce the period of time required to complete maintenance work orders.

(G) The percentage of units that an agency fails to inspect to ascertain maintenance or modernization needs within such period of time as the Secretary deems appropriate (with appropriate adjustments, if any, for large and small agencies).

(H) The extent to which the public housing agency

(i) coordinates, promotes, or provides effective programs and activities to promote the economic self-sufficiency of public housing residents; and

(ii) provides public housing residents with opportunities for involvement in the administration of the public housing.

(I) 2 The extent to which the public housing agency

(i) implements effective screening and eviction policies and other anticrime strategies; and

(ii) coordinates with local government officials and residents in the project and implementation of such strategies.

(J) The extent to which the public housing agency is providing acceptable basic housing conditions.

(K) Any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate which shall not exceed the seven factors in the statute, plus an additional five.

(I) 3 The Secretary shall:

(1) administer the system of evaluating public housing agencies flexibly to ensure that such agencies are not penalized as result of circumstances beyond their control;

(2) reflect in the weights assigned to the various indicators the differences in the difficulty of managing individual projects that result from their physical condition and their neighborhood environment; and

(3) determine a public housing agency’s status as “troubled with respect to the program under section 1437 l 4 of this title” based upon factors solely related to its ability to carry out that program.

(2)

(A)

(i) The Secretary shall, under the rulemaking procedures under section 553 of title 5 , establish procedures for designating troubled public housing agencies, which procedures shall include identification of serious and substantial failure to perform as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and such other factors as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate. Such procedures shall provide that an agency that fails on a widespread basis to provide acceptable basic housing conditions for its residents shall be designated as a troubled public housing agency. The Secretary may use a simplified set of indicators for public housing agencies with less than 250 public housing units. The Secretary shall also designate, by rule under section 553 of title 5 , agencies that are troubled with respect to the program for assistance from the Capital Fund under section 1437g(d) of this title .

(ii) The Secretary may also, in consultation with national organizations representing public housing agencies and public officials (as the Secretary determines appropriate), identify and commend public housing agencies that meet the performance standards established under paragraph (1) in an exemplary manner.

(iii) The Secretary shall establish procedures for public housing agencies to appeal designation as a troubled agency (including designation as a troubled agency for purposes of the program for assistance from the Capital Fund under section 1437g(d) of this title ), to petition for removal of such designation, and to appeal any refusal to remove such designation.

(B)

(i) Upon designating a public housing agency with more than 250 units as troubled pursuant to subparagraph (A) and determining that an assessment under this subparagraph will not duplicate any comparable and recent review, the Secretary shall provide for an on-site, independent assessment of the management of the agency.

(ii) To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency’s performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), the assessment team shall also consider issues relating to the agency’s resident population and physical inventory, including the extent to which (I) the agency’s comprehensive plan prepared pursuant to section 1437 l 4 of this title adequately and appropriately addresses the rehabilitation needs of the agency’s inventory, (II) residents of the agency are involved in and informed of significant management decisions, and (III) any projects in the agency’s inventory are severely distressed and eligible for assistance pursuant to section 1437v of this title .

(iii) An independent assessment under this subparagraph shall be carried out by a team of knowledgeable individuals selected by the Secretary (referred to in this section as the “assessment team”) with expertise in public housing and real estate management. In conducting an assessment, the assessment team shall consult with the residents and with public and private entities in the jurisdiction in which the public housing is located. The assessment team shall provide to the Secretary and the public housing agency a written report, which shall contain, at a minimum, recommendations for such management improvements as are necessary to eliminate or substantially remedy existing deficiencies.
