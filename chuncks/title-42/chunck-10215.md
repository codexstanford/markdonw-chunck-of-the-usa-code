#### § 1862q. Informal STEM education
##### (c) PreK–12 informal STEM

(1) In general

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall make awards, through existing programs where appropriate to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations (or consortia of such intuitions  1 or organizations) on a merit-reviewed, competitive basis for research on effective approaches to engaging students in PreK–12, including students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM and rural students.

(2) Purposes

The purposes of this subsection are to

(A) provide effective, compelling, and engaging means for teaching and reinforcing fundamental STEM concepts to PreK–12 students;

(B) expand the STEM workforce pipeline by increasing the number of youth in the United States exposed to STEM from an early age and encourage them to pursue careers in STEM-related fields; and

(C) broaden participation of groups historically underrepresented in STEM and rural students, in the STEM workforce.

(3) Use of funds

(A) In general

Awards made under this subsection shall support research and development on innovative before-school, after-school, out-of-school, or summer activities that are designed to encourage interest, engagement, and skills development in STEM, including for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM and rural students.

(B) Permitted activities

The research and development activities described in subparagraph (A) may include

(i) the provision of programming described in such subparagraph for the purpose of research described in such subparagraph;

(ii) the use of a variety of engagement methods, including cooperative and hands-on learning;

(iii) exposure of students to role models in the fields of STEM and near-peer mentors;

(iv) training of informal learning educators, youth-serving professionals, and volunteers who lead informal STEM programs in using evidence-based methods consistent with the target student population being served;

(v) education of students on the relevance and significance of STEM careers, provision of academic advice and assistance, and activities designed to help students make real-world connections to STEM content;

(vi) the preparation of students to attend events, competitions, and academic programs that provide content expertise and encourage career exposure in STEM, which may include the purchase of parts and supplies needed to prepare for participation in such competitions;

(vii) activities designed to engage parents and families of students in PreK–12 in STEM;

(viii) innovative strategies to engage students, such as using leadership skills and outcome measures to impart youth with the confidence to pursue STEM coursework and academic study;

(ix) coordination with STEM-rich environments, including other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations, out-of-  2 classroom settings, institutions of higher education, vocational facilities, corporations, museums, or science centers; and

(x) the acquisition of instructional materials or technology-based tools to conduct applicable award activity.

(4) Application

An applicant seeking funding under this subsection shall submit an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as may be required by the Director. Applications that include or partner with a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that has extensive experience and expertise in increasing the participation of students in PreK–12 in STEM are encouraged. At a minimum, the application shall include the following:

(A) A description of the target audience to be served by the research activity or activities for which such funding is sought.

(B) A description of the process for recruitment and selection of students to participate in such activities.

(C) A description of how such activity or activities may inform programming that engages students in PreK–12 in STEM.

(D) A description of how such activity or activities may inform programming that promotes student academic achievement in STEM.

(E) An evaluation plan that includes, at a minimum, the use of outcome-oriented measures to determine the impact and efficacy of programming being researched.

(5) Evaluations
