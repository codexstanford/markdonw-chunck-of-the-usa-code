#### § 5511. Federally assisted or federally constructed housing
##### (a) Maximum dollar amount of federally assisted mortgage loan or maximum per unit or other cost or floor area limitation of federally constructed housing

(1) In determining the maximum dollar amount of any federally assisted mortgage loan (as defined in subsection (b)) or the maximum per unit or other cost or floor area limitation of any federally constructed housing (as defined in subsection (c)), where the law establishing the program under which the loan is made or the housing is constructed specifies such maximum per unit or other cost on floor area limitation and the structure involved is furnished with solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment under the demonstration program established by section 5503, 5504, or 5507 of this title, the maximum amount or cost or floor area limitation so specified which is applicable to such structure shall be deemed to be increased by the amount by which (as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary of Defense, as appropriate) the price or cost or floor area limitation of the structure including such solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment exceeds the price or cost or floor area limitation of the structure with such equipment replaced by conventional heating equipment or conventional heating and cooling equipment (as the case may be).

(2) In addition, in the case of a federally assisted mortgage loan, the cost excess specified in subsection (a) shall be fully taken into account in determining the value or cost of the structure involved for purposes of applying any statutory provision specifying the maximum loan-to-value or -cost ratio; except that, if the law specifies different rates of downpayment for successive increments of such value or cost, the lowest such rate shall apply to the additional cost attributable to the solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment, and such equipment shall otherwise be excluded in determining the total value or cost of the structure.
