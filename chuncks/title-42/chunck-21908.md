#### § 16298b. High efficiency turbines
##### (b) Program elements

The program shall

(1) support first-of-a-kind engineering and detailed gas turbine design for small-scale and utility-scale electric power generation, including

(A) high temperature materials, including superalloys, coatings, and ceramics;

(B) improved heat transfer capability;

(C) manufacturing technology required to construct complex 3-dimensional geometry parts with improved aerodynamic capability;

(D) combustion technology to produce higher firing temperature while lowering nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions per unit of output;

(E) advanced controls and systems integration;

(F) advanced high performance compressor technology; and

(G) validation facilities for the testing of components and subsystems;

(2) include technology demonstration through component testing, subscale testing, and full-scale testing in existing fleets;

(3) include field demonstrations of the developed technology elements to demonstrate technical and economic feasibility;

(4) assess overall combined cycle and simple cycle system performance;

(5) increase fuel flexibility by enabling gas turbines to operate with high proportions of, or pure, hydrogen or other renewable gas fuels;

(6) enhance foundational knowledge needed for low-emission combustion systems that can work in high-pressure, high-temperature environments required for high-efficiency cycles;

(7) increase operational flexibility by reducing turbine start-up times and improving the ability to accommodate flexible power demand; and

(8) include any other elements necessary to achieve the goals described in subsection (c), as determined by the Secretary, in consultation with private industry.
