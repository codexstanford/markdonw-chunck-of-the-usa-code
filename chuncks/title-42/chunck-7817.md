Not later than 180 days after March 23, 2010 , the Secretary, in consultation with the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, shall establish procedures under which screening is conducted with respect to providers of medical or other items or services and suppliers under the program under this subchapter, the Medicaid program under subchapter XIX, and the CHIP program under subchapter XXI.

(B) Level of screening

The Secretary shall determine the level of screening conducted under this paragraph according to the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse, as determined by the Secretary, with respect to the category of provider of medical or other items or services or supplier. Such screening

(I) a criminal background check;

(II) fingerprinting;

(III) unscheduled and unannounced site visits, including preenrollment site visits;

(IV) database checks (including such checks across States); and

(V) such other screening as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(C) Application fees

(i) Institutional providers

Except as provided in clause (ii), the Secretary shall impose a fee on each institutional provider of medical or other items or services or supplier (such as a hospital or skilled nursing facility) with respect to which screening is conducted under this paragraph in an amount equal to

The Secretary may promulgate an interim final rule to carry out this paragraph.

(3) Provisional period of enhanced oversight for new providers of services and suppliers
