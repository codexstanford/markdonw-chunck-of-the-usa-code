#### § 16154. Clean hydrogen research and development program
##### (c) Focus

In carrying out activities under this section, the Secretary shall focus on factors that are common to the development of hydrogen infrastructure and the supply of vehicle and electric power for critical consumer and commercial applications, and that achieve continuous technical evolution and cost reduction, particularly for hydrogen production, the supply of hydrogen, storage of hydrogen, and end uses of hydrogen that

(1) steadily increase production, distribution, and end use efficiency and reduce life-cycle emissions;

(2) resolve critical problems relating to catalysts, membranes, storage, lightweight materials, electronic controls, manufacturability, and other problems that emerge from the program;

(3) enhance sources of fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration, renewable fuels, biofuels, and nuclear energy for hydrogen production; and

(4) enable widespread use of distributed electricity generation and storage.
