### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (u) Limitation of Federal financial participation in erroneous medical assistance expenditures
######## (E) For purposes of subparagraph (D), there shall be excluded, in determining both erroneous excess payments for medical assistance and total expenditures for medical assistance

(i) payments with respect to any individual whose eligibility therefor was determined exclusively by the Secretary under an agreement pursuant to section 1383c of this title and such other classes of individuals as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe whose eligibility was determined in part under such an agreement; and

(ii) payments made as the result of a technical error.

(2) The State agency administering the plan approved under this subchapter shall, at such times and in such form as the Secretary may specify, provide information on the rates of erroneous excess payments made (or expected, with respect to future periods specified by the Secretary) in connection with its administration of such plan, together with any other data he requests that are reasonably necessary for him to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

(3)

(A) If a State fails to cooperate with the Secretary in providing information necessary to carry out this subsection, the Secretary, directly or through contractual or such other arrangements as he may find appropriate, shall establish the error rates for that State on the basis of the best data reasonably available to him and in accordance with such techniques for sampling and estimating as he finds appropriate.

(B) In any case in which it is necessary for the Secretary to exercise his authority under subparagraph (A) to determine a State’s error rates for a fiscal year, the amount that would otherwise be payable to such State under this subchapter for quarters in such year shall be reduced by the costs incurred by the Secretary in making (directly or otherwise) such determination.

(4) This subsection shall not apply with respect to Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, or American Samoa.
