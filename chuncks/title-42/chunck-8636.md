#### § 1396u–3. State coverage of medicare cost-sharing for additional low-income medicare beneficiaries
##### (b) Selection of qualifying individuals

A State shall select qualifying individuals, and provide such individuals with assistance, under this section consistent with the following:

(1) All qualifying individuals may apply

The State shall permit all qualifying individuals to apply for assistance during a calendar year.

(2) Selection on first-come, first-served basis

(A) In general

For each calendar year (beginning with 1998), from (and to the extent of) the amount of the allocation under subsection (c) for the State for the fiscal year ending in such calendar year, the State shall select qualifying individuals who apply for the assistance in the order in which they apply.

(B) Carryover

For calendar years after 1998, the State shall give preference to individuals who were provided such assistance (or other assistance described in section 1396a(a)(10)(E) of this title ) in the last month of the previous year and who continue to be (or become) qualifying individuals.

(3) Limit on number of individuals based on allocation

The State shall limit the number of qualifying individuals selected with respect to assistance in a calendar year so that the aggregate amount of such assistance provided to such individuals in such year is estimated to be equal to (but not exceed) the State’s allocation under subsection (c) for the fiscal year ending in such calendar year.

(4) Receipt of assistance during duration of year

If a qualifying individual is selected to receive assistance under this section for a month in a year, the individual is entitled to receive such assistance for the remainder of the year if the individual continues to be a qualifying individual. The fact that an individual is selected to receive assistance under this section at any time during a year does not entitle the individual to continued assistance for any succeeding year.
