##### (t) Obtaining information from drug abuse treatment facilities

(1) Authority

Notwithstanding any other provision of law other than the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), a public housing agency may require each person who applies for admission to public housing to sign one or more forms of written consent authorizing the agency to receive information from a drug abuse treatment facility that is solely related to whether the applicant is currently engaging in the illegal use of a controlled substance.

(2) Confidentiality of applicant’s records

(A) Limitation on information requested

In a form of written consent, a public housing agency may request only whether the drug abuse treatment facility has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant is currently engaging in the illegal use of a controlled substance.

(B) Records management

Each public housing agency that receives information under this subsection from a drug abuse treatment facility shall establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any information received by the public housing agency under this subsection

(i) is maintained confidentially in accordance with section 543 of the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 290dd–2 ];

(ii) is not misused or improperly disseminated; and

(iii) is destroyed, as applicable

(I) not later than 5 business days after the date on which the public housing agency gives final approval for an application for admission; or

(II) if the public housing agency denies the application for admission, in a timely manner after the date on which the statute of limitations for the commencement of a civil action from the applicant based upon that denial of admission has expired.

(C) Expiration of written consent

In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (B), an applicant’s signed written consent shall expire automatically after the public housing agency has made a final decision to either approve or deny the applicant’s application for admittance to public housing.

(3) Prohibition of discriminatory treatment of applicants

(A) Forms signed

A public housing agency may only require an applicant for admission to public housing to sign one or more forms of written consent under this subsection if the public housing agency requires all such applicants to sign the same form or forms of written consent.

(B) Circumstances of inquiry

A public housing agency may only make an inquiry to a drug abuse treatment facility under this subsection if

(i) the public housing agency makes the same inquiry with respect to all applicants; or

(ii) the public housing agency only makes the same inquiry with respect to each and every applicant with respect to whom

(I) the public housing agency receives information from the criminal record of the applicant that indicates evidence of a prior arrest or conviction; or

(II) the public housing agency receives information from the records of prior tenancy of the applicant that demonstrates that the applicant

(aa) engaged in the destruction of property;

(bb) engaged in violent activity against another person; or

(cc) interfered with the right of peaceful enjoyment of the premises of another tenant.

(4) Fee permitted

A drug abuse treatment facility may charge a public housing agency a reasonable fee for information provided under this subsection.

(5) Disclosure permitted by treatment facilities

A drug abuse treatment facility shall not be liable for damages based on any information required to be disclosed pursuant to this subsection if such disclosure is consistent with section 543 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 290dd–2 ).

(6) Option to not request information

A public housing agency shall not be liable for damages based on its decision not to require each person who applies for admission to public housing to sign one or more forms of written consent authorizing the public housing agency to receive information from a drug abuse treatment facility under this subsection.
