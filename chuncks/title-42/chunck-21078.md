#### § 15022. State allotments
##### (e) Reallotments

(1) In general

If the Secretary determines that an amount of an allotment to a State for a period (of a fiscal year or longer) will not be required by the State during the period for the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Secretary may reallot the amount.

(2) Timing

The Secretary may make such a reallotment from time to time, on such date as the Secretary may fix, but not earlier than 30 days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make the reallotment in the Federal Register.

(3) Amounts

The Secretary shall reallot the amount to other States with respect to which the Secretary has not made that determination. The Secretary shall reallot the amount in proportion to the original allotments of the other States for such fiscal year, but shall reduce such proportionate amount for any of the other States to the extent the proportionate amount exceeds the sum that the Secretary estimates the State needs and will be able to use during such period.

(4) Reallotment of reductions

The Secretary shall similarly reallot the total of the reductions among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced.

(5) Treatment

Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of the allotment of the State under subsection (a) for such fiscal year.
