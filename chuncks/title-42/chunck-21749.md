#### § 16215. Electric transmission and distribution programs
##### (e) Power delivery research initiative

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish a research, development, and demonstration initiative specifically focused on power delivery using components incorporating high temperature superconductivity.

(2) Goals

The goals of the Initiative shall be

(A) to establish world-class facilities to develop high temperature superconductivity power applications in partnership with manufacturers and utilities;

(B) to provide technical leadership for establishing reliability for high temperature superconductivity power applications, including suitable modeling and analysis;

(C) to facilitate the commercial transition toward direct current power transmission, storage, and use for high power systems using high temperature superconductivity; and

(D) to facilitate the integration of very low impedance high temperature superconducting wires and cables in existing electric networks to improve system performance, power flow control, and reliability.

(3) Inclusions

The Initiative shall include

(A) feasibility analysis, planning, research, and design to construct demonstrations of superconducting links in high power, direct current, and controllable alternating current transmission systems;

(B) public-private partnerships to demonstrate deployment of high temperature superconducting cable into testbeds simulating a realistic transmission grid and under varying transmission conditions, including actual grid insertions; and

(C) testbeds developed in cooperation with National Laboratories, industries, and institutions of higher education to

(i) demonstrate those technologies;

(ii) prepare the technologies for commercial introduction; and

(iii) address cost or performance roadblocks to successful commercial use.
