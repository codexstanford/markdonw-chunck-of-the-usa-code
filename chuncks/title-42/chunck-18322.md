### CHAPTER 106— COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM
#### § 9918. Limitations on use of funds
##### (a) Construction of facilities

(1) Limitations

Except as provided in paragraph (2), grants made under this chapter (other than amounts reserved under section 9903(b)(3) of this title ) may not be used by the State, or by any other person with which the State makes arrangements to carry out the purposes of this chapter, for the purchase or improvement of land, or the purchase, construction, or permanent improvement (other than low-cost residential weatherization or other energy-related home repairs) of any building or other facility.

(2) Waiver

The Secretary may waive the limitation contained in paragraph (1) upon a State request for such a waiver, if the Secretary finds that the request describes extraordinary circumstances to justify the purchase of land or the construction of facilities (or the making of permanent improvements) and that permitting the waiver will contribute to the ability of the State to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
