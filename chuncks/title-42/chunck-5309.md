Such contract shall specify the terms under which New York City shall be considered to have made the full payment required for a quarter for purposes of subsection (b)(2).

(B) Full contribution amount

Under such contract, with respect to each calendar quarter of fiscal year 2016 and of each subsequent fiscal year through fiscal year 2090, the full contribution amount under this subparagraph shall be equal to 10 percent of the expenditures in carrying out this subchapter for the respective quarter.

The payment obligation under such contract for a calendar quarter in a fiscal year shall be paid not later than the last day of the second succeeding calendar quarter.

(E) Compliance

(i) Interest for late payment

If New York City fails to pay to the WTC Program Administrator pursuant to such contract the amount required for any calendar quarter by the day specified in subparagraph (D), interest shall accrue on the amount not so paid at the rate (determined by the Administrator) based on the average yield to maturity, plus 1 percentage point, on outstanding municipal bonds issued by New York City with a remaining maturity of at least 1 year.

(ii) Recovery of amounts owed

The amounts owed to the WTC Program Administrator under such contract shall be recoverable by the United States in an action in the same manner as payments made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] may be recoverable in an action brought under section 1862(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii) ].

(F) Deposit in fund

The WTC Program Administer shall deposit amounts paid under such contract into the World Trade Center Health Program Fund under section 300mm–61 of this title .

With respect to each calendar quarter for which a contribution is required by New York City under the contract under paragraph (1), the WTC Program Administrator shall

(A) provide New York City with an estimate of such amount of the required contribution at the beginning of such quarter and with an updated estimate of such amount at the beginning of each of the subsequent 2 quarters;

(B) bill such amount directly to New York City; and

(C) certify periodically, for purposes of this subsection, whether or not New York City has paid the amount so billed. Such amount shall initially be estimated by the WTC Program Administrator and shall be subject to adjustment and reconciliation based upon actual expenditures in carrying out this subchapter.

(3) Rule of construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as authorizing the WTC Administrator, with respect to a fiscal year, to reduce the numerical limitation under section 300mm–21(a)(4) or 300mm–31(a)(3) of this title for such fiscal year if New York City fails to comply with paragraph (1) for a calendar quarter in such fiscal year.
