#### § 15909. Gas hydrate production incentive
##### (b) Suspension of royalties

(1) In general

The Secretary may grant royalty relief in accordance with this section for natural gas produced from gas hydrate resources under an eligible lease.

(2) Eligible leases

A lease shall be an eligible lease for purposes of this section if

(A) it is issued under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), or is an oil and gas lease issued for onshore Federal lands in Alaska;

(B) it is issued prior to January 1, 2016 ; and

(C) production under the lease of natural gas from gas hydrate resources commences prior to January 1, 2018 .

(3) Amount of relief

The Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking and grant royalty relief under this section as a suspension volume if the Secretary determines that such royalty relief would encourage production of natural gas from gas hydrate resources from an eligible lease. The maximum suspension volume shall be 30 billion cubic feet of natural gas per lease. Such relief shall be in addition to any other royalty relief under any other provision applicable to the lease that does not specifically grant a gas hydrate production incentive. Such royalty suspension volume shall be applied to any eligible production occurring on or after the date of publication of the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.

(4) Limitation

The Secretary may place limitations on royalty relief granted under this section based on market price.
