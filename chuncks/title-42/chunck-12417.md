#### § 3541. Paperwork reduction
##### (a) Declaration of policy

The Congress finds and declares

(1) that various departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government with responsibilities involving housing and housing finance programs, require, approve, use or otherwise employ a variety of different forms as residential mortgages (or deeds of trust or similar security instruments) as notes secured by those mortgages, and for applications, appraisals and other purposes, and that such duplication of forms constitutes a paperwork burden that adds to the costs imposed on the Nation’s homeowners and home buyers;

(2) that unnecessary paperwork impairs the effectiveness of Federal housing and housing finance programs;

(3) that both single-family and multi-family programs are affected; and

(4) that simplification of paperwork imposed by Federal housing and housing finance programs would contribute to achieving the Nation’s housing goals by reducing housing costs.
