The Secretary shall issue interim final or final regulations to carry out this section and section 1396u–4 of this title .

(2) Use of PACE protocol

(A) In general

In issuing such regulations, the Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with the provisions of this section, incorporate the requirements applied to PACE demonstration waiver programs under the PACE protocol.

(B) Flexibility

In order to provide for reasonable flexibility in adapting the PACE service delivery model to the needs of particular organizations (such as those in rural areas or those that may determine it appropriate to use nonstaff physicians according to State licensing law requirements) under this section and section 1396u–4 of this title , the Secretary (in close consultation with State administering agencies) may modify or waive provisions of the PACE protocol so long as any such modification or waiver is not inconsistent with and would not impair the essential elements, objectives, and requirements of this section, but may not modify or waive any of the following provisions:

(i) The focus on frail elderly qualifying individuals who require the level of care provided in a nursing facility.

(ii) The delivery of comprehensive, integrated acute and long-term care services.

(iii) The interdisciplinary team approach to care management and service delivery.

(iv) Capitated, integrated financing that allows the provider to pool payments received from public and private programs and individuals.

(v) The assumption by the provider of full financial risk.

(C) Continuation of modifications or waivers of operational requirements under demonstration status

If a PACE program operating under demonstration authority has contractual or other operating arrangements which are not otherwise recognized in regulation and which were in effect on July 1, 2000 , the Secretary (in close consultation with, and with the concurrence of, the State administering agency) shall permit any such program to continue such arrangements so long as such arrangements are found by the Secretary and the State to be reasonably consistent with the objectives of the PACE program.

(3) Application of certain additional beneficiary and program protections

(A) In general

In issuing such regulations and subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may apply with respect to PACE programs, providers, and agreements such requirements of part C (or, for periods before January 1, 1999 , section 1395mm of this title ) and sections 1396b(m) and 1396u–2 of this title relating to protection of beneficiaries and program integrity as would apply to Medicare+Choice organizations under part C (or for such periods eligible organizations under risk-sharing contracts under section 1395mm of this title ) and to medicaid managed care organizations under prepaid capitation agreements under section 1396b(m) of this title .

(B) Considerations

In issuing such regulations, the Secretary shall

(i) take into account the differences between populations served and benefits provided under this section and under part C (or, for periods before January 1, 1999 , section 1395mm of this title ) and section 1396b(m) of this title ;

(ii) not include any requirement that conflicts with carrying out PACE programs under this section; and

(iii) not include any requirement restricting the proportion of enrollees who are eligible for benefits under this subchapter or subchapter XIX.

(4) Construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from including in regulations provisions to ensure the health and safety of individuals enrolled in a PACE program under this section that are in addition to those otherwise provided under paragraphs (2) and (3).
