The Inspector General shall also conduct such a study and submit such a report before the Secretary conducts a subsequent competitive acquistion  2 program described in subparagraph (A).

With respect to bids to furnish diabetic testing strip products on or after January 1, 2019 , an entity shall attest to the Secretary that the entity has the ability to obtain an inventory of the types and quantities of diabetic testing strip products that will allow the entity to furnish such products in a manner consistent with its bid and
