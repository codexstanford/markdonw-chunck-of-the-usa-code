#### § 1395w–23. Payments to Medicare+Choice organizations
##### (e) Special rules for individuals electing MSA plans

(1) In general

If the amount of the Medicare+Choice monthly MSA premium (as defined in section 1395w–24(b)(2)(C) of this title ) for an MSA plan for a year is less than 1 ⁄ 12 of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate applied under this section for the area and year involved, the Secretary shall deposit an amount equal to 100 percent of such difference in a Medicare+Choice MSA established (and, if applicable, designated) by the individual under paragraph (2).

(2) Establishment and designation of Medicare+Choice medical savings account as requirement for payment of contribution

In the case of an individual who has elected coverage under an MSA plan, no payment shall be made under paragraph (1) on behalf of an individual for a month unless the individual

(A) has established before the beginning of the month (or by such other deadline as the Secretary may specify) a Medicare+Choice MSA (as defined in section 138(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and

(B) if the individual has established more than one such Medicare+Choice MSA, has designated one of such accounts as the individual’s Medicare+Choice MSA for purposes of this part. Under rules under this section, such an individual may change the designation of such account under subparagraph (B) for purposes of this part.

(3) Lump-sum deposit of medical savings account contribution

In the case of an individual electing an MSA plan effective beginning with a month in a year, the amount of the contribution to the Medicare+Choice MSA on behalf of the individual for that month and all successive months in the year shall be deposited during that first month. In the case of a termination of such an election as of a month before the end of a year, the Secretary shall provide for a procedure for the recovery of deposits attributable to the remaining months in the year.
