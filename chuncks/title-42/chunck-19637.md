### CHAPTER 129— NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE
#### § 12581. Provision of assistance and approved national service positions
##### (l) Authority for fixed-amount grants

(1) In general

(A) Authority

From amounts appropriated for a fiscal year to provide financial assistance under the national service laws, the Corporation may provide assistance in the form of fixed-amount grants in an amount determined by the Corporation under paragraph (2) rather than on the basis of actual costs incurred by a program.

(B) Limitation

Other than fixed-amount grants to support programs described in section 12581a of this title , for the 1-year period beginning on the effective date of the Serve America Act, the Corporation may provide assistance in the form of fixed-amount grants to programs that only offer full-time positions.

(2) Determination of amount of fixed-amount grants

A fixed-amount grant authorized by this subsection shall be in an amount determined by the Corporation that is

(A) significantly less than the reasonable and necessary costs of administering the program supported by the grant; and

(B) based on an amount per individual enrolled in the program receiving the grant, taking into account

(i) the capacity of the entity carrying out the program to manage funds and achieve programmatic results;

(ii) the number of approved national service positions, approved silver scholar positions, or approved summer of service positions for the program, if applicable;

(iii) the proposed design of the program;

(iv) whether the program provides service to, or involves the participation of, disadvantaged youth or otherwise would reasonably incur a relatively higher level of costs; and

(v) such other factors as the Corporation may consider under section 12585 of this title in considering applications for assistance.

(3) Requirements for grant recipients

In awarding a fixed-amount grant under this subsection, the Corporation

(A) shall require the grant recipient

(i) to return a pro rata amount of the grant funds based upon the difference between the number of hours served by a participant and the minimum number of hours for completion of a term of service (as established by the Corporation);

(ii) to report on the program’s performance on standardized measures and performance levels established by the Corporation;

(iii) to cooperate with any evaluation activities undertaken by the Corporation; and

(iv) to provide assurances that additional funds will be raised in support of the program, in addition to those received under the national service laws; and

(B) may adopt other terms and conditions that the Corporation considers necessary or appropriate based on the relative risks (as determined by the Corporation) associated with any application for a fixed-amount grant.

(4) Other requirements not applicable

Limitations on administrative costs and matching fund documentation requirements shall not apply to fixed-amount grants provided in accordance with this subsection.

(5) Rule of construction

Nothing in this subsection shall relieve a grant recipient of the responsibility to comply with the requirements of chapter 75 of title 31 or other requirements of Office of Management and Budget Circular A–133.
