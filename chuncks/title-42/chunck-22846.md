### CHAPTER 152— ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY
#### § 17384a. Smart grid modeling, visualization, architecture, and controls
##### (g) Grid architecture and scenario development

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary shall establish and facilitate a collaborative process to develop model grid architecture and a set of future scenarios for the electric grid to examine the impacts of different combinations of resources (including different quantities of distributed energy resources and large-scale, central generation) on the electric grid.

(2) Architecture

In supporting the development of model grid architectures, the Secretary shall

(A) analyze a variety of grid architecture scenarios that range from minor upgrades to existing transmission grid infrastructure to scenarios that involve the replacement of significant portions of existing transmission grid infrastructure;

(B) analyze the effects of the increasing proliferation of renewable and other zero emissions energy generation sources, increasing use of distributed resources owned by non-utility entities, and the use of digital and automated controls not managed by grid operators;

(C) include a variety of new and emerging distribution grid technologies, including distributed energy resources, electric vehicle charging stations, distribution automation technologies, energy storage, and renewable energy sources;

(D) analyze the effects of local load balancing and other forms of decentralized control;

(E) analyze the effects of changes to grid architectures resulting from modernizing electric grid systems, including communications, controls, markets, consumer choice, emergency response, electrification, and cybersecurity concerns; and

(F) develop integrated grid architectures that incorporate system resilience for cyber, physical, and communications systems.

(3) Market structure

The grid architecture and scenarios developed under paragraph (1) shall, to the extent practicable, account for differences in market structure, including an examination of the potential for stranded costs in each type of market structure.
