### CHAPTER 129— NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE
#### § 12576. Other special assistance
##### (c) Challenge grants for national service programs

(1) Assistance authorized

The Corporation may make challenge grants under this subsection to programs supported under the national service laws.

(2) Selection criteria

The Corporation shall develop criteria for the selection of recipients of challenge grants under this subsection, so as to make the grants widely available to a variety of programs that

(A) are high-quality national service programs; and

(B) are carried out by entities with demonstrated experience in establishing and implementing projects that provide benefits to participants and communities.

(3) Amount of assistance

A challenge grant under this subsection may provide, for an initial 3-year grant period, not more than $1 of assistance under this subsection for each $1 in cash raised from private sources by the program supported under the national service laws in excess of amounts required to be provided by the program to satisfy matching funds requirements. After an initial 3-year grant period, a grant under this subsection may provide not more than $1 of assistance under this subsection for each $2 in cash raised from private sources by the program in excess of amounts required to be provided by the program to satisfy matching funds requirements. The Corporation may permit the use of local or State funds under this paragraph in lieu of cash raised from private sources if the Corporation determines that such use would be equitable due to a lack of available private funds at the local level. The Corporation shall establish a ceiling on the amount of assistance that may be provided to a national service program under this subsection.
