##### (g) Agency procedures

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (f). These standards and procedures

(A) shall provide for the Secretary to make the determination to impose the penalty or to use an administrative entity to make the determination;

(B) shall provide for the imposition of a penalty only after the person has been given an opportunity for a hearing on the record; and

(C) may provide for review by the Secretary of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing. If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination. If the Secretary reviews the determination or order, the Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order. If the Secretary does not review the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.

(2) Factors in determining amount of penalty

In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (f), consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, ability to pay the penalty, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine in regulations to be appropriate.

(3) Reviewability of imposition of a penalty

The Secretary’s determination or order imposing a penalty under subsection (f) shall not be subject to review, except as provided in subsection (h).
