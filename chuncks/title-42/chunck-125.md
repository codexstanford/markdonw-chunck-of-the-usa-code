### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 233. Civil actions or proceedings against commissioned officers or employees
##### (i) Authority of Attorney General to exclude health care professionals from coverage

(1) Notwithstanding subsection (g)(1), the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, may on the record determine, after notice and opportunity for a full and fair hearing, that an individual physician or other licensed or certified health care practitioner who is an officer, employee, or contractor of an entity described in subsection (g)(4) shall not be deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of this section, if treating such individual as such an employee would expose the Government to an unreasonably high degree of risk of loss because such individual

(A) does not comply with the policies and procedures that the entity has implemented pursuant to subsection (h)(1);

(B) has a history of claims filed against him or her as provided for under this section that is outside the norm for licensed or certified health care practitioners within the same specialty;

(C) refused to reasonably cooperate with the Attorney General in defending against any such claim;

(D) provided false information relevant to the individual’s performance of his or her duties to the Secretary, the Attorney General, or an applicant for or recipient of funds under this chapter; or

(E) was the subject of disciplinary action taken by a State medical licensing authority or a State or national professional society.

(2) A final determination by the Attorney General under this subsection that an individual physician or other licensed or certified health care professional shall not be deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service shall be effective upon receipt by the entity employing such individual of notice of such determination, and shall apply only to acts or omissions occurring after the date such notice is received.
