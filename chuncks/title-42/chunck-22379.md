#### § 17051. Renewable fuel dispenser requirements
##### (b) Dispenser feasibility study

Not later than 24 months after December 19, 2007 , the Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, shall report to the Congress on the feasibility of requiring motor fuel retailers to install E–85 compatible dispensers and related systems at retail fuel facilities in regions where flexible-fuel vehicle market penetration has reached 15 percent of motor vehicles. In conducting such study, the Secretary shall consider and report on the following factors:

(1) The commercial availability of E–85 fuel and the number of competing E–85 wholesale suppliers in a given region.

(2) The level of financial assistance provided on an annual basis by the Federal Government, State governments, and nonprofit entities for the installation of E–85 compatible infrastructure.

(3) The number of retailers whose retail locations are unable to support more than 2 underground storage tank dispensers.

(4) The expense incurred by retailers in the installation and sale of E–85 compatible dispensers and related systems and any potential effects on the price of motor vehicle fuel.
