### CHAPTER 134— ENERGY POLICY
#### § 13573. Generation projects
##### (b) Criteria

The Secretary shall establish criteria for the selection of generation projects under section 13572(a)(1) of this title . The Secretary may modify the criteria as appropriate to reflect improvements in equipment, except that the criteria shall not be modified to be less stringent. The selection criteria shall include

(1) prioritization of projects whose installation is likely to result in significant air quality improvements in nonattainment air quality areas;

(2) prioritization of projects whose installation is likely to result in lower emission rates of pollution;

(3) prioritization of projects that result in the repowering or replacement of older, less efficient units;

(4) documented broad interest in the procurement of the equipment and utilization of the processes used in the projects by owners or operators of facilities for electricity generation;

(5) equipment and processes beginning in 2006 through 2011 that are projected to achieve a thermal efficiency of

(A) 40 percent for coal of more than 9,000 Btu per pound based on higher heating values;

(B) 38 percent for coal of 7,000 to 9,000 Btu per pound passed on higher heating values; and

(C) 36 percent for coal of less than 7,000 Btu per pound based on higher heating values; except that energy used for coproduction or cogeneration shall not be counted in calculating the thermal efficiency under this paragraph; and

(6) equipment and processes beginning in 2012 and 2013 that are projected to achieve a thermal efficiency of

(A) 45 percent for coal of more than 9,000 Btu per pound based on higher heating values;

(B) 44 percent for coal of 7,000 to 9,000 Btu per pound passed on higher heating values; and

(C) 40 percent for coal of less than 7,000 Btu per pound based on higher heating values; except that energy used for coproduction or cogeneration shall not be counted in calculating the thermal efficiency under this paragraph.
