#### § 1395ss. Certification of medicare supplemental health insurance policies
##### (t) Medicare select policies

(1) If a medicare supplemental policy meets the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation and otherwise complies with the requirements of this section except that benefits under the policy are restricted to items and services furnished by certain entities (or reduced benefits are provided when items or services are furnished by other entities), the policy shall nevertheless be treated as meeting those standards if

(A) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished through a network of entities which have entered into contracts or agreements with the issuer of the policy;

(B) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished by other entities if the services are medically necessary and immediately required because of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition and it is not reasonable given the circumstances to obtain the services through the network;

(C) the network offers sufficient access;

(D) the issuer of the policy has arrangements for an ongoing quality assurance program for items and services furnished through the network;

(E)

(i) the issuer of the policy provides to each enrollee at the time of enrollment an explanation of (I) the restrictions on payment under the policy for services furnished other than by or through the network, (II) out of area coverage under the policy, (III) the policy’s coverage of emergency services and urgently needed care, and (IV) the availability of a policy through the entity that meets the standards in the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation without reference to this subsection and the premium charged for such policy, and

(ii) each enrollee prior to enrollment acknowledges receipt of the explanation provided under clause (i); and

(F) the issuer of the policy makes available to individuals, in addition to the policy described in this subsection, any policy (otherwise offered by the issuer to individuals in the State) that meets the standards in the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation and other requirements of this section without reference to this subsection.

(2) If the Secretary determines that an issuer of a policy approved under paragraph (1)

(A) fails substantially to provide medically necessary items and services to enrollees seeking such items and services through the issuer’s network, if the failure has adversely affected (or has substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) the individual,

(B) imposes premiums on enrollees in excess of the premiums approved by the State,

(C) acts to expel an enrollee for reasons other than nonpayment of premiums, or

(D) does not provide the explanation required under paragraph (1)(E)(i) or does not obtain the acknowledgment required under paragraph (1)(E)(ii), the issuer is subject to a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .

(3) The Secretary may enter into a contract with an entity whose policy has been certified under paragraph (1) or has been approved by a State under subsection (b)(1)(H) to determine whether items and services (furnished to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter and under that policy) are not allowable under section 1395y(a)(1) of this title . Payments to the entity shall be in such amounts as the Secretary may determine, taking into account estimated savings under contracts with carriers and fiscal intermediaries and other factors that the Secretary finds appropriate. Paragraph (1), the first sentence of paragraph (2)(A), paragraph (2)(B), paragraph (3)(C), paragraph (3)(D), and paragraph (3)(E)  5 of section 1395u(b) of this title shall apply to the entity.
