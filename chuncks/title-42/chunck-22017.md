#### § 16372. Determination of eligibility and project selection
##### (b) Eligibility

(1) In general

A project shall be eligible to receive a Federal credit instrument or a grant under the CIFIA program if

(A) the entity proposing to carry out the project submits a letter of interest prior to submission of an application under paragraph (3) for the project; and

(B) the project meets the criteria described in this subsection.

(2) Creditworthiness

(A) In general

Each project and obligor that receives a Federal credit instrument or a grant under the CIFIA program shall be creditworthy, such that there exists a reasonable prospect of repayment of the principal and interest on the Federal credit instrument, as determined by the Secretary under subparagraph (B).

(B) Reasonable prospect of repayment

The Secretary shall base a determination of whether there is a reasonable prospect of repayment under subparagraph (A) on a comprehensive evaluation of whether the obligor has a reasonable prospect of repaying the Federal credit instrument for the eligible project, including evaluation of

(i) the strength of the contractual terms of an eligible project (if available for the applicable market segment);

(ii) the forecast of noncontractual cash flows supported by market projections from reputable sources, as determined by the Secretary, and cash sweeps or other structural enhancements;

(iii) the projected financial strength of the obligor

(I) at the time of loan close; and

(II) throughout the loan term, including after the project is completed;

(iv) the financial strength of the investors and strategic partners of the obligor, if applicable; and

(v) other financial metrics and analyses that are relied on by the private lending community and nationally recognized credit rating agencies, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

(3) Applications

To be eligible for assistance under the CIFIA program, an obligor shall submit to the Secretary a project application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(4) Eligible project costs

A project under the CIFIA program shall have eligible project costs that are reasonably anticipated to equal or exceed $100,000,000.

(5) Revenue sources

The applicable Federal credit instrument shall be repayable, in whole or in part, from

(A) user fees;

(B) payments owing to the obligor under a public-private partnership; or

(C) other revenue sources that also secure or fund the project obligations.

(6) Obligor will be identified later

A State, local government, agency, or instrumentality of a State or local government, or a public authority, may submit to the Secretary an application under paragraph (3), under which a private party to a public-private partnership will be

(A) the obligor; and

(B) identified at a later date through completion of a procurement and selection of the private party.

(7) Beneficial effects

The Secretary shall determine that financial assistance for each project under the CIFIA program will

(A) attract public or private investment for the project; or

(B) enable the project to proceed at an earlier date than the project would otherwise be able to proceed or reduce the lifecycle costs (including debt service costs) of the project.

(8) Project readiness

To be eligible for assistance under the CIFIA program, the applicant shall demonstrate a reasonable expectation that the contracting process for construction of the project can commence by not later than 90 days after the date on which a Federal credit instrument or grant is obligated for the project under the CIFIA program.
