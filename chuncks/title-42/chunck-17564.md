### CHAPTER 97— ACID PRECIPITATION PROGRAM AND CARBON DIOXIDE STUDY
#### § 8903. Comprehensive research plan
##### (b) Scope

The comprehensive plan shall include programs for

(1) identifying the sources of atmospheric emissions contributing to acid precipitation;

(2) establishing and operating a nationwide long-term monitoring network to detect and measure levels of acid precipitation;

(3) research in atmospheric physics and chemistry to facilitate understanding of the processes by which atmospheric emissions are transformed into acid precipitation;

(4) development and application of atmospheric transport models to enable prediction of long-range transport of substances causing acid precipitation;

(5) defining geographic areas of impact through deposition monitoring, identification of sensitive areas, and identification of areas at risk;

(6) broadening of impact data bases through collection of existing data on water and soil chemistry and through temporal trend analysis;

(7) development of dose-response functions with respect to soils, soil organisms, aquatic and amphibious organisms, crop plants, and forest plants;

(8) establishing and carrying out system studies with respect to plant physiology, aquatic ecosystems, soil chemistry systems, soil microbial systems, and forest ecosystems;

(9) economic assessments of (A) the environmental impacts caused by acid precipitation on crops, forests, fisheries, and recreational and aesthetic resources and structures, and (B) alternative technologies to remedy or otherwise ameliorate the harmful effects which may result from acid precipitation;

(10) documenting all current Federal activities related to research on acid precipitation and ensuring that such activities are coordinated in ways that prevent needless duplication and waste of financial and technical resources;

(11) effecting cooperation in acid precipitation research and development programs, ongoing and planned, with the affected and contributing States and with other sovereign nations having a commonality of interest;

(12) subject to subsection (f)(1), management by the Task Force of financial resources committed to Federal acid precipitation research and development;

(13) subject to subsection (f)(2), management of the technical aspects of Federal acid precipitation research and development programs, including but not limited to (A) the planning and management of research and development programs and projects, (B) the selection of contractors and grantees to carry out such programs and projects, and (C) the establishment of peer review procedures to assure the quality of research and development programs and their products; and

(14) analyzing the information available regarding acid precipitation in order to formulate and present periodic recommendations to the Congress and the appropriate agencies about actions to be taken by these bodies to alleviate acid precipitation and its effects.
