#### § 18795. Home energy performance-based, whole-house rebates
##### (b) Application

A State energy office seeking a grant under this section shall submit to the Secretary an application that includes a plan to implement a HOMES rebate program, including a plan

(1) to use procedures, as approved by the Secretary, for determining the reductions in home energy use resulting from the implementation of a home energy efficiency retrofit that are calibrated to historical energy usage for a home consistent with BPI 2400, for purposes of modeled performance home rebates;

(2) to use open-source advanced measurement and verification software, as approved by the Secretary, for determining and documenting the monthly and hourly (if available) weather-normalized energy use of a home before and after the implementation of a home energy efficiency retrofit, for purposes of measured performance home rebates;

(3) to value savings based on time, location, or greenhouse gas emissions;

(4) for quality monitoring to ensure that each home energy efficiency retrofit for which a rebate is provided is documented in a certificate that

(A) is provided by the contractor and certified by a third party to the homeowner; and

(B) details the work performed, the equipment and materials installed, and the projected energy savings or energy generation to support accurate valuation of the retrofit;

(5) to provide a contractor performing a home energy efficiency retrofit or an aggregator who has the right to claim a rebate $200 for each home located in a disadvantaged community that receives a home energy efficiency retrofit for which a rebate is provided under the program; and

(6) to ensure that a homeowner or aggregator does not receive a rebate for the same upgrade through both a HOMES rebate program and any other Federal grant or rebate program, pursuant to subsection (c)(7).
