#### § 1397gg. Strategic objectives and performance goals; plan administration
##### (g) Use of blended risk pools

(1) In general

Nothing in this subchapter (or any other provision of Federal law) shall be construed as preventing a State from considering children enrolled in a qualified CHIP look-alike program and children enrolled in a State child health plan under this subchapter (or a waiver of such plan) as members of a single risk pool.

(2) Qualified CHIP look-alike program

In this subsection, the term “qualified CHIP look-alike program” means a State program

(A) under which children who are under the age of 19 and are not eligible to receive medical assistance under subchapter XIX or child health assistance under this subchapter may purchase coverage through the State that provides benefits that are at least identical to the benefits provided under the State child health plan under this subchapter (or a waiver of such plan); and

(B) that is funded exclusively through non-Federal funds, including funds received by the State in the form of premiums for the purchase of such coverage.
