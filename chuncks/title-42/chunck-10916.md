#### § 2021e. Limited availability of certain regional disposal facilities during transition and licensing periods
##### (c) Commercial nuclear power reactor allocations

(1) Amount

Subject to the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) each commercial nuclear power reactor shall upon request receive an allocation of low-level radioactive waste disposal capacity (in cubic feet) at the facilities referred to in subsection (b) during the 4-year transition period beginning January 1, 1986 , and ending December 31, 1989 , and during the 3-year licensing period beginning January 1, 1990 , and ending December 31, 1992 , in an amount calculated by multiplying the appropriate number from the following table by the number of months remaining in the applicable period as determined under paragraph (2).

(2) Method of calculation

For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of disposal capacity available to a commercial nuclear power reactor under this subsection, the number of months shall be computed beginning with the first month of the applicable period, or the sixteenth month after receipt of a full power operating license, whichever occurs later.

(3) Unused allocations

Any unused allocation under paragraph (1) received by a reactor during the transition period or the licensing period may be used at any time after such reactor receives its full power license or after the beginning of the pertinent period, whichever is later, but not in any event after December 31, 1992 , or after commencement of operation of a regional disposal facility in the compact region or State in which such reactor is located, whichever occurs first.

(4) Transferability

Any commercial nuclear power reactor in a State or compact region that is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (e) may assign any disposal capacity allocated to it under this subsection to any other person in each State or compact region. Such assignment may be for valuable consideration and shall be in writing, copies of which shall be filed at the affected compact commissions and States, along with the assignor’s unconditional written waiver of the disposal capacity being assigned.

(5) Unusual volumes

(A) The Secretary may, upon petition by the owner or operator of any commercial nuclear power reactor, allocate to such reactor disposal capacity in excess of the amount calculated under paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds and states in writing his reasons for so finding that making additional capacity available for such reactor through this paragraph is required to permit unusual or unexpected operating, maintenance, repair or safety activities.

(B) The Secretary may not make allocations pursuant to subparagraph (A) that would result in the acceptance for disposal of more than 800,000 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste or would result in the total of the allocations made pursuant to this subsection exceeding 11,900,000 cubic feet over the entire seven-year interim access period.

(6) Limitation

During the seven-year interim access period referred to in subsection (a), the disposal facilities referred to in subsection (b) shall not be required to accept more than 11,900,000 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste generated by commercial nuclear power reactors.
