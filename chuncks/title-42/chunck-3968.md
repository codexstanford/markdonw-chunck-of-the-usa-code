(1) In general

The Administrator shall conduct a continuing program of studies to identify groups within the general population that may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to contaminants in drinking water. The study shall examine whether and to what degree infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subpopulations that can be identified and characterized are likely to experience elevated health risks, including risks of cancer, from contaminants in drinking water.

(2) Report

Not later than 4 years after August 6, 1996 , and periodically thereafter as new and significant information becomes available, the Administrator shall report to the Congress on the results of the studies.
