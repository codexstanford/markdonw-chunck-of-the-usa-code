Each State, during the 3rd month of any additional extended assistance furnished to a family under this subsection, shall notify the family of the reporting requirement under subparagraph (B)(ii) and a statement of the amount of any premium required for such extended assistance for the succeeding 3 months.

(B) Reporting requirements

(i) During initial extension period

Each State shall require (as a condition for additional extended assistance under this subsection) that a family receiving extended assistance under subsection (a) report to the State, not later than the 21st day of the 4th month in the period of extended assistance under subsection (a), on the family’s gross monthly earnings and on the family’s costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative in each of the first 3 months of that period. A State may permit such additional extended assistance under this subsection notwithstanding a failure to report under this clause if the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis.

(ii) During additional extension period

Each State shall require that a family receiving extended assistance under this subsection report to the State, not later than the 21st day of the 1st month and of the 4th month in the period of additional extended assistance under this subsection, on the family’s gross monthly earnings and on the family’s costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative in each of the 3 preceding months.

(iii) Clarification on frequency of reporting

A State may not require that a family receiving extended assistance under this subsection or subsection (a) report more frequently than as required under clause (i) or (ii).

(3) Termination of extension

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), extension of assistance during the 6-month period described in paragraph (1) to a family shall terminate (during the period) as follows:

(i) No dependent child

The extension shall terminate at the close of the first month in which the family ceases to include a child, whether or not the child is (or would if needy be) a dependent child under part A of subchapter IV.

(ii) Failure to pay any premium

If the family fails to pay any premium for a month under paragraph (5) by the 21st day of the following month, the extension shall terminate at the close of that following month, unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to pay such premium on a timely basis.

(iii) Quarterly income reporting and test

The extension under this subsection shall terminate at the close of the 1st or 4th month of the 6-month period if

(I) the family fails to report to the State, by the 21st day of such month, the information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis;

(II) the caretaker relative had no earnings in one or more of the previous 3 months, unless such lack of any earnings was due to an involuntary loss of employment, illness, or other good cause, established to the satisfaction of the State; or

(III) the State determines that the family’s average gross monthly earnings (less such costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative) during the immediately preceding 3-month period exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 9902(2) of this title ) applicable to a family of the size involved. Information described in clause (iii)(I) shall be subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure of information provided under section 602(a)(9)  1 of this title. Instead of terminating a family’s extension under clause (iii)(I), a State, at its option, may provide for suspension of the extension until the month after the month in which the family reports information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), but only if the family’s extension has not otherwise been terminated under subclause (II) or (III) of clause (iii). The State shall make determinations under clause (iii)(III) for a family each time a report under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the family is received.

(B) Notice before termination

No termination of assistance shall become effective under subparagraph (A) until the State has provided the family with notice of the grounds for the termination, which notice shall include (in the case of termination under subparagraph (A)(iii)(II), relating to no continued earnings) a description of how the family may reestablish eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan. No such termination shall be effective earlier than 10 days after the date of mailing of such notice.

(C) Continuation in certain cases until redetermination

(i) Dependent children

With respect to a child who would cease to receive medical assistance because of subparagraph (A)(i) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the child is described in clause (i) of section 1396d(a) of this title or clause (i)(IV), (i)(VI), (i)(VII), or (ii)(IX) of section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title , the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the child is not eligible for assistance under the plan.

(ii) Medically needy

With respect to an individual who would cease to receive medical assistance because of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the individual is within a category of person for which medical assistance under the State plan is available under section 1396a(a)(10)(C) of this title (relating to medically needy individuals), the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the individual is not eligible for assistance under the plan.

(4) Coverage

(A) In general

During the extension period under this subsection

(i) the State plan shall offer to each family medical assistance which (subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C)) is the same amount, duration, and scope as would be made available to the family if it were still receiving aid under the plan approved under part A of subchapter IV; and

(ii) the State plan may offer alternative coverage described in subparagraph (D).

(B) Elimination of most non-acute care benefits

At a State’s option, the State may elect to apply the option described in subsection (a)(4)(B) (relating to “wrap-around” coverage) for families electing medical assistance under this subsection in the same manner as such option applies to families provided extended eligibility for medical assistance under subsection (a).
