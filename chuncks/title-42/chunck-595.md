### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 247d–6d. Targeted liability protections for pandemic and epidemic products and security countermeasures
##### (e) Procedures for suit

(1) Exclusive Federal jurisdiction

Any action under subsection (d) shall be filed and maintained only in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

(2) Governing law

The substantive law for decision in an action under subsection (d) shall be derived from the law, including choice of law principles, of the State in which the alleged willful misconduct occurred, unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law, including provisions of this section.

(3) Pleading with particularity

In an action under subsection (d), the complaint shall plead with particularity each element of the plaintiff’s claim, including

(A) each act or omission, by each covered person sued, that is alleged to constitute willful misconduct relating to the covered countermeasure administered to or used by the person on whose behalf the complaint was filed;

(B) facts supporting the allegation that such alleged willful misconduct proximately caused the injury claimed; and

(C) facts supporting the allegation that the person on whose behalf the complaint was filed suffered death or serious physical injury.

(4) Verification, certification, and medical records

(A) In general

In an action under subsection (d), the plaintiff shall verify the complaint in the manner stated in subparagraph (B) and shall file with the complaint the materials described in subparagraph (C). A complaint that does not substantially comply with subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not be accepted for filing and shall not stop the running of the statute of limitations.

(B) Verification requirement

(i) In general

The complaint shall include a verification, made by affidavit of the plaintiff under oath, stating that the pleading is true to the knowledge of the deponent, except as to matters specifically identified as being alleged on information and belief, and that as to those matters the plaintiff believes it to be true.

(ii) Identification of matters alleged upon information and belief

Any matter that is not specifically identified as being alleged upon the information and belief of the plaintiff, shall be regarded for all purposes, including a criminal prosecution, as having been made upon the knowledge of the plaintiff.

(C) Materials required

In an action under subsection (d), the plaintiff shall file with the complaint

(i) an affidavit, by a physician who did not treat the person on whose behalf the complaint was filed, certifying, and explaining the basis for such physician’s belief, that such person suffered the serious physical injury or death alleged in the complaint and that such injury or death was proximately caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure; and

(ii) certified medical records documenting such injury or death and such proximate causal connection.

(5) Three-judge court

Any action under subsection (d) shall be assigned initially to a panel of three judges. Such panel shall have jurisdiction over such action for purposes of considering motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, and matters related thereto. If such panel has denied such motions, or if the time for filing such motions has expired, such panel shall refer the action to the chief judge for assignment for further proceedings, including any trial. Section 1253 of title 28 and paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of section 2284 of title 28 shall not apply to actions under subsection (d).

(6) Civil discovery

(A) Timing

In an action under subsection (d), no discovery shall be allowed

(i) before each covered person sued has had a reasonable opportunity to file a motion to dismiss;

(ii) in the event such a motion is filed, before the court has ruled on such motion; and

(iii) in the event a covered person files an interlocutory appeal from the denial of such a motion, before the court of appeals has ruled on such appeal.

(B) Standard

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court in an action under subsection (d) shall permit discovery only with respect to matters directly related to material issues contested in such action, and the court shall compel a response to a discovery request (including a request for admission, an interrogatory, a request for production of documents, or any other form of discovery request) under Rule 37, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, only if the court finds that the requesting party needs the information sought to prove or defend as to a material issue contested in such action and that the likely benefits of a response to such request equal or exceed the burden or cost for the responding party of providing such response.

(7) Reduction in award of damages for collateral source benefits

(A) In general

In an action under subsection (d), the amount of an award of damages that would otherwise be made to a plaintiff shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source benefits to such plaintiff.

(B) Provider of collateral source benefits not to have lien or subrogation

No provider of collateral source benefits shall recover any amount against the plaintiff or receive any lien or credit against the plaintiff’s recovery or be equitably or legally subrogated to the right of the plaintiff in an action under subsection (d).

(C) Collateral source benefit defined

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “collateral source benefit” means any amount paid or to be paid in the future to or on behalf of the plaintiff, or any service, product, or other benefit provided or to be provided in the future to or on behalf of the plaintiff, as a result of the injury or wrongful death, pursuant to

(i) any State or Federal health, sickness, income-disability, accident, or workers’ compensation law;

(ii) any health, sickness, income-disability, or accident insurance that provides health benefits or income-disability coverage;

(iii) any contract or agreement of any group, organization, partnership, or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical, hospital, dental, or income disability benefits; or

(iv) any other publicly or privately funded program.

(8) Noneconomic damages

In an action under subsection (d), any noneconomic damages may be awarded only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility of a defendant for the harm to the plaintiff. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “noneconomic damages” means damages for losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.

(9) Rule 11 sanctions

Whenever a district court of the United States determines that there has been a violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in an action under subsection (d), the court shall impose upon the attorney, law firm, or parties that have violated Rule 11 or are responsible for the violation, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the other party or parties for the reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper that is the subject of the violation, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. Such sanction shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, and to compensate the party or parties injured by such conduct.

(10) Interlocutory appeal

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have jurisdiction of an interlocutory appeal by a covered person taken within 30 days of an order denying a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment based on an assertion of the immunity from suit conferred by subsection (a) or based on an assertion of the exclusion under subsection (c)(5).
