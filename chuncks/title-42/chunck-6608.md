#### § 1320a–7m. Use of predictive modeling and other analytics technologies to identify and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare fee-for-service program
##### (b) Predictive analytics technologies requirements

The predictive analytics technologies used by the Secretary shall

(1) capture Medicare provider and Medicare beneficiary activities across the Medicare fee-for-service program to provide a comprehensive view across all providers, beneficiaries, and geographies within such program in order to

(A) identify and analyze Medicare provider networks, provider billing patterns, and beneficiary utilization patterns; and

(B) identify and detect any such patterns and networks that represent a high risk of fraudulent activity;

(2) be integrated into the existing Medicare fee-for-service program claims flow with minimal effort and maximum efficiency;

(3) be able to

(A) analyze large data sets for unusual or suspicious patterns or anomalies or contain other factors that are linked to the occurrence of waste, fraud, or abuse;

(B) undertake such analysis before payment is made; and

(C) prioritize such identified transactions for additional review before payment is made in terms of the likelihood of potential waste, fraud, and abuse to more efficiently utilize investigative resources;

(4) capture outcome information on adjudicated claims for reimbursement to allow for refinement and enhancement of the predictive analytics technologies on the basis of such outcome information, including post-payment information about the eventual status of a claim; and

(5) prevent the payment of claims for reimbursement that have been identified as potentially wasteful, fraudulent, or abusive until such time as the claims have been verified as valid.
