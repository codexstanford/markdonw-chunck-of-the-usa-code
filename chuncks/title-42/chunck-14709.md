##### (a) Definitions

In this section:

(1) Combined heat and power

The term “combined heat and power” means the generation of electric energy and heat in a single, integrated system, with an overall thermal efficiency of 60 percent or greater on a higher-heating-value basis.

(2) District energy systems

The term “district energy systems” means systems providing thermal energy from a renewable energy source, thermal energy source, or highly efficient technology to more than 1 building or fixed energy-consuming use from 1 or more thermal-energy production facilities through pipes or other means to provide space heating, space conditioning, hot water, steam, compression, process energy, or other end uses for that energy.

(3) Energy sustainability

The term “energy sustainability” includes using a renewable energy source, thermal energy source, or a highly efficient technology for transportation, electricity generation, heating, cooling, lighting, or other energy services in fixed installations.

(4) Institution of higher education

The term “institution of higher education” has the meaning given the term in section 15801 of this title .

(5) Institutional entity

The term “renewable energy source” has the meaning given the term in section 918c of title 7 .

(7) Sustainable energy infrastructure

The term “sustainable energy infrastructure” means

(A) facilities for production of energy from renewable energy sources, thermal energy sources, or highly efficient technologies, including combined heat and power or other waste heat use; and

(B) district energy systems.

(8) Thermal energy source

The term “thermal energy source” means
