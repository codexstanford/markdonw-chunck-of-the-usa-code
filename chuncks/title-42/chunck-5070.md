#### § 300gg–137. Patient-provider dispute resolution
##### (a) In general

Not later than January 1, 2022 , the Secretary shall establish a process (in this subsection referred to as the “patient-provider dispute resolution process”) under which an uninsured individual, with respect to an item or service, who received, pursuant to section 300gg–136 of this title , from a health care provider or health care facility a good-faith estimate of the expected charges for furnishing such item or service to such individual and who after being furnished such item or service by such provider or facility is billed by such provider or facility for such item or service for charges that are substantially in excess of such estimate, may seek a determination from a selected dispute resolution entity for the charges to be paid by such individual (in lieu of such amount so billed) to such provider or facility for such item or service. For purposes of this subsection, the term “uninsured individual” means, with respect to an item or service, an individual who does not have benefits for such item or service under a group health plan, group or individual health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, Federal health care program (as defined in section 1320a–7b(f) of this title ), or a health benefits plan under chapter 89 of title 5 (or an individual who has benefits for such item or service under a group health plan or individual or group health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, but who does not seek to have a claim for such item or service submitted to such plan or coverage).
