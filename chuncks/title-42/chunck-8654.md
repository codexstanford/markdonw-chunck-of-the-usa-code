(D) Data match

The Secretary shall perform such periodic data matches as may be necessary to identify and compute the number of full-benefit dual eligible individuals for purposes of computing the amount under subparagraph (A).

(2) Amount

(A) In general

The amount computed under this paragraph for a State described in paragraph (1) and for a month in a year is equal to

(i) 1 ⁄ 12 of the product of

(I) the base year State medicaid per capita expenditures for covered part D drugs for full-benefit dual eligible individuals (as computed under paragraph (3)); and

(II) a proportion equal to 100 percent minus the Federal medical assistance percentage (as defined in section 1396d(b) of this title ) applicable to the State for the fiscal year in which the month occurs; and

(ii) increased for each year (beginning with 2004 up to and including the year involved) by the applicable growth factor specified in paragraph (4) for that year.

The Secretary shall notify each State described in paragraph (1) not later than October 15 before the beginning of each year (beginning with 2006) of the amount computed under subparagraph (A) for the State for that year.

(3) Base year state medicaid per capita expenditures for covered part D drugs for full-benefit dual eligible individuals

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), the “base year State medicaid per capita expenditures for covered part D drugs for full-benefit dual eligible individuals” for a State is equal to the weighted average (as weighted under subparagraph (C)) of

(i) the gross per capita medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs for 2003, determined under subparagraph (B); and

(ii) the estimated actuarial value of prescription drug benefits provided under a capitated managed care plan per full-benefit dual eligible individual for 2003, as determined using such data as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(B) Gross per capita medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs

(i) In general

The gross per capita medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs for 2003 under this subparagraph is equal to the expenditures, including dispensing fees, for the State under this subchapter during 2003 for covered outpatient drugs, determined per full-benefit-dual-eligible-individual for such individuals not receiving medical assistance for such drugs through a medicaid managed care plan.

(III) reduce such expenditures by the product of such portion and the adjustment factor (described in clause (iii)).

The adjustment factor described in this clause for a State is equal to the ratio for the State for 2003 of

(I) aggregate payments under agreements under section 1396r–8 of this title ; to

(II) the gross expenditures under this subchapter for covered outpatient drugs referred to in clause (i). Such factor shall be determined based on information reported by the State in the medicaid financial management reports (form CMS–64) for the 4 quarters of calendar year 2003 and such other data as the Secretary may require.

(C) Weighted average

The weighted average under subparagraph (A) shall be determined taking into account

(i) with respect to subparagraph (A)(i), the average number of full-benefit dual eligible individuals in 2003 who are not described in clause (ii); and

(ii) with respect to subparagraph (A)(ii), the average number of full-benefit dual eligible individuals in such year who received in 2003 medical assistance for covered outpatient drugs through a medicaid managed care plan.

(4) Applicable growth factor

The applicable growth factor under this paragraph for

(A) each of 2004, 2005, and 2006, is the average annual percent change (to that year from the previous year) of the per capita amount of prescription drug expenditures (as determined based on the most recent National Health Expenditure projections for the years involved); and
