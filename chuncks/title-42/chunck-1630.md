(1) The Director of NIH may obtain (in accordance with section 3109 of title 5 , but without regard to the limitation in such section on the period of service) the services of not more than 220 experts or consultants, with scientific or other professional qualifications, for the National Institutes of Health.

(2)

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), experts and consultants whose services are obtained under paragraph (1) shall be paid or reimbursed, in accordance with title 5, for their travel to and from their place of service and for other expenses associated with their assignment.

(B) Expenses specified in subparagraph (A) shall not be allowed in connection with the assignment of an expert or consultant whose services are obtained under paragraph (1) unless the expert or consultant has agreed in writing to complete the entire period of the assignment or one year of the assignment, whichever is shorter, unless separated or reassigned for reasons which are beyond the control of the expert or consultant and which are acceptable to the Secretary. If the expert or consultant violates the agreement, the money spent by the United States for such expenses is recoverable from the expert or consultant as a debt due the United States. The Secretary may waive in whole or in part a right of recovery under this subparagraph.
