#### § 8411. Administrative procedures
##### (d) Public comment on prohibitions and exemptions

(1) In the case of any proposed rule or order by the Secretary imposing a prohibition or any petition for any order granting an exemption under this chapter, any interested person shall be afforded an opportunity to present oral data, views, and arguments at a public hearing. At such hearing any interested person shall have an opportunity to question

(A) other interested persons who make oral presentations,

(B) employees and contractors of the United States who have made written or oral presentations or who have participated in the development of the proposed rule or order or in the consideration of such petition, and

(C) experts and consultants who have provided information to any person who makes an oral presentation and which is contained in or referred to in such presentation, with respect to disputed issues of material fact, except that the Secretary may restrict questioning if he determines that such questioning is duplicative or is not likely to result in a timely and effective resolution of such issues. Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the Secretary as a matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

(2) A rule or order subject to this section may not be issued except on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.
