The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Vaccine Program under subchapter XIX and acting through the Directors of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute for Aging, and other public and private programs, shall carry out activities, which shall be consistent with the global Children’s Vaccine Initiative, to develop affordable new and improved vaccines to be used in the United States and in the developing world that will increase the efficacy and efficiency of the prevention of infectious diseases. In carrying out such activities, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, develop and make available vaccines that require fewer contacts to deliver, that can be given early in life, that provide long lasting protection, that obviate refrigeration, needles and syringes, and that protect against a larger number of diseases.
