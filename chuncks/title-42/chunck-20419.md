#### § 13257. Fleet requirement program
##### (g) Fleet requirement program

(1) If the Secretary determines under subsection (e) that a fleet requirement program is necessary, the Secretary shall, by January 1, 2000 , by rule require that, except as provided in paragraph (2), of the total number of new light duty motor vehicles acquired for a fleet, other than a Federal fleet, State fleet, or fleet owned, operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by a covered person under section 13251 of this title

(A) 20 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 2002;

(B) 40 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 2003;

(C) 60 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 2004; and

(D) 70 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 2005 and thereafter, shall be alternative fueled vehicles.

(2) The Secretary may not establish percentage requirements higher than those described in paragraph (1). The Secretary may, if appropriate, and pursuant to a rule under subsection (g), establish a lesser percentage requirement for any model year. The Secretary may, by rule, establish a date later than 2002 (when model year 2003 begins) for initiating the fleet requirements under paragraph (1).

(3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as requiring any fleet to acquire alternative fueled vehicles or alternative fuels that do not meet the normal business requirements and practices and needs of that fleet.

(4) A vehicle operating only on gasoline that complies with applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act [ 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] shall not be considered an alternative fueled vehicle under subsection (b) or this subsection, except that the Secretary, as part of the rule under subsection (b) or this subsection, may determine that such vehicle should be treated as an alternative fueled vehicle for purposes of this section, for fleets subject to part C of title II of the Clean Air Act [ 42 U.S.C. 7581 et seq.], taking into consideration the impact on energy security and the goals stated in section 13252(a) of this title .
