(B) Conversion

If the owner of a project requests the use of the project for the direct benefit of very low-income persons with disabilities and, pursuant to such request the Secretary determines that a project is no longer needed for use as supportive housing for persons with disabilities, the Secretary may approve the request and authorize the owner to convert the project to such use.

The Secretary shall, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, upon expiration of a contract (or any renewed contract), renew such contract for a term of not less than 60 months.
