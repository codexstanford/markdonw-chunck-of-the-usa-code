### CHAPTER 108— NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY
#### § 10197. Research and development on disposal of high-level radioactive waste
##### (h) Limitations

(1) If the test and evaluation facility is not located at the site of a repository, the Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Commission with respect to the decontamination and decommissioning of such facility.

(2) If the test and evaluation facility is not located at a candidate site or repository site, the Secretary shall conduct only the portion of the in situ testing program required in subsection (c) determined by the Secretary to be useful in carrying out the purposes of this chapter.

(3) The operation of the test and evaluation facility shall terminate not later than

(A) 5 years after the date on which the initial repository begins operation; or

(B) at such time as the Secretary determines that the continued operation of a test and evaluation facility is not necessary for research, development, and demonstration purposes; whichever occurs sooner.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, as soon as practicable following any determination by the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Commission, that the test and evaluation facility is unsuitable for continued operation, the Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to remove from such site any radioactive material placed on such site as a result of testing and evaluation activities conducted under this section. Such requirement may be waived if the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Commission, finds that short-term testing and evaluation activities using radioactive material will not endanger the public health and safety.
