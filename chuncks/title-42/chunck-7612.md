(iii) Redeterminations and appeals through medicaid

Redeterminations and appeals, with respect to eligibility determinations under clause (i) made under a State plan under subchapter XIX, shall be made in accordance with the frequency of, and manner in which, redeterminations and appeals of eligibility are made under such plan for purposes of medical assistance under such subchapter.

(i) for 2006 three times the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have and obtain benefits under that program; and

(III) matters attested to in the application shall be subject to appropriate methods of verification.

(iv) Methodology flexibility

The Secretary may permit a State in making eligibility determinations for premium and cost-sharing subsidies under this section to use the same asset or resource methodologies that are used with respect to eligibility for medical assistance for medicare cost-sharing described in section 1396d(p) of this title so long as the Secretary determines that the use of such methodologies will not result in any significant differences in the number of individuals determined to be subsidy eligible individuals.

(F) Treatment of territorial residents

In the case of a part D eligible individual who is not a resident of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, the individual is not eligible to be a subsidy eligible individual under this section but may be eligible for financial assistance with prescription drug expenses under section 1396u–5(e) of this title .
