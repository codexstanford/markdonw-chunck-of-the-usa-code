#### § 423. Disability insurance benefit payments
##### (c) Definitions; insured status; waiting period

For purposes of this section

(1) An individual shall be insured for disability insurance benefits in any month if

(A) he would have been a fully insured individual (as defined in section 414 of this title ) had he attained age 62 and filed application for benefits under section 402(a) of this title on the first day of such month, and

(B)

(i) he had not less than 20 quarters of coverage during the 40-quarter period which ends with the quarter in which such month occurred, or

(ii) if such month ends before the quarter in which he attains (or would attain) age 31, not less than one-half (and not less than 6) of the quarters during the period ending with the quarter in which such month occurred and beginning after he attained the age of 21 were quarters of coverage, or (if the number of quarters in such period is less than 12) not less than 6 of the quarters in the 12-quarter period ending with such quarter were quarters of coverage, or

(iii) in the case of an individual (not otherwise insured under clause (i)) who, by reason of section 416(i)(3)(B)(ii) of this title , had a prior period of disability that began during a period before the quarter in which he or she attained age 31, not less than one-half of the quarters beginning after such individual attained age 21 and ending with the quarter in which such month occurs are quarters of coverage, or (if the number of quarters in such period is less than 12) not less than 6 of the quarters in the 12-quarter period ending with such quarter are quarters of coverage; except that the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of an individual who is blind (within the meaning of “blindness” as defined in section 416(i)(1) of this title ). For purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, when the number of quarters in any period is an odd number, such number shall be reduced by one, and a quarter shall not be counted as part of any period if any part of such quarter was included in a period of disability unless such quarter was a quarter of coverage.

(2) The term “waiting period” means, in the case of any application for disability insurance benefits, the earliest period of five consecutive calendar months

(A) throughout which the individual with respect to whom such application is filed has been under a disability, and

(B)

(i) which begins not earlier than with the first day of the seventeenth month before the month in which such application is filed if such individual is insured for disability insurance benefits in such seventeenth month, or (ii) if he is not so insured in such month, which begins not earlier than with the first day of the first month after such seventeenth month in which he is so insured. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, no waiting period may begin for any individual before January 1, 1957 .
