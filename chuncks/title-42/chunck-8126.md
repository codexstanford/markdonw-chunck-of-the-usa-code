(A) Taking into consideration the recommendations of the Commission, the Secretary shall recommend for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1988) an appropriate change factor for inpatient hospital services for discharges in that fiscal year which will take into account amounts necessary for the efficient and effective delivery of medically appropriate and necessary care of high quality. The appropriate change factor may be different for all large urban subsection (d) hospitals, other urban subsection (d) hospitals, urban subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals, rural subsection (d) hospitals, and rural subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals, and all other hospitals and units not paid under subsection (d), and may vary among such other hospitals and units.

(B) In addition to the recommendation made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Commission under paragraph (2)(B), recommend for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992) other appropriate changes in each existing reimbursement policy under this subchapter under which payments to an institution are based upon prospectively determined rates.

(5) The Secretary shall cause to have published in the Federal Register, not later than

(A) the April 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986), the Secretary’s proposed recommendations under paragraph (4) for that fiscal year for public comment, and

(B) the August 1 before such fiscal year after such consideration of public comment on the proposal as is feasible in the time available, the Secretary’s final recommendations under such paragraph for that year. The Secretary shall include in the publication referred to in subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year the report of the Commission’s recommendations submitted under paragraph (3) for that fiscal year. To the extent that the Secretary’s recommendations under paragraph (4) differ from the Commission’s recommendations for that fiscal year, the Secretary shall include in the publication referred to in subparagraph (A) an explanation of the Secretary’s grounds for not following the Commission’s recommendations.
