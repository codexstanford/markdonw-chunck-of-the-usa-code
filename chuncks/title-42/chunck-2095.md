(1) In general

With respect to activities for which an award under subsection (a) is authorized to be expended, the Director of the Institute may not make such an award to a designated research institution or consortium for any fiscal year unless the institution, or institutions in the consortium, as the case may be, agree to maintain expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such activities at a level that is not less than the level of such expenditures maintained by the institutions involved for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which such institutions receive such an award.

(2) Use of Federal funds

With respect to any Federal amounts received by a designated research institution or consortium and available for carrying out activities for which an award under subsection (a) is authorized to be expended, the Director of the Institute may make such an award only if the institutions involved agree that the institutions will, before expending the award, expend the Federal amounts obtained from sources other than the award.
