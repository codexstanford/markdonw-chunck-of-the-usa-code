### CHAPTER 92— POWERPLANT AND INDUSTRIAL FUEL USE
#### § 8311. Coal capability of new electric powerplants; certification of compliance
##### (b) Capability to use coal or alternate fuel

An electric powerplant has the capability to use coal or another alternate fuel for purposes of this section if such electric powerplant

(1) has sufficient inherent design characteristics to permit the addition of equipment (including all necessary pollution devices) necessary to render such electric powerplant capable of using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source; and

(2) is not physically, structurally, or technologically precluded from using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source. Capability to use coal or another alternate fuel shall not be interpreted to require any such powerplant to be immediately able to use coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source on its initial day of operation.
