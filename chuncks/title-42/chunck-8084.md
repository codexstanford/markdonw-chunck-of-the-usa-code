#### § 1395ww. Payments to hospitals for inpatient hospital services
##### (b) Computation of payment; definitions; exemptions; adjustments
######## (B) In determining under subparagraph (A) whether to assign a new base period which is more representative of the reasonable and necessary cost to a hospital of providing inpatient services, the Secretary shall take into consideration

(i) changes in applicable technologies and medical practices, or differences in the severity of illness among patients, that increase the hospital’s costs;

(ii) whether increases in wages and wage-related costs for hospitals located in the geographic area in which the hospital is located exceed the average of the increases in such costs paid by hospitals in the United States; and

(iii) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in determining increases in the hospital’s costs of providing inpatient services.

(C) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to payment of hospitals which is otherwise determined under paragraph (3) of section 1395f(b) of this title .

(5) In the case of any hospital having any cost reporting period of other than a 12-month period, the Secretary shall determine the 12-month period which shall be used for purposes of this section.

(6) In the case of any hospital which becomes subject to the taxes under section 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to any or all of its employees, for part or all of a cost reporting period, and was not subject to such taxes with respect to any or all of its employees for all or part of the 12-month base cost reporting period referred to in subsection (b)(3)(A)(i), the Secretary shall provide for an adjustment by increasing the base period amount described in such subsection for such hospital by an amount equal to the amount of such taxes which would have been paid or accrued by such hospital for such base period if such hospital had been subject to such taxes for all of such base period with respect to all its employees, minus the amount of any such taxes actually paid or accrued for such base period.
