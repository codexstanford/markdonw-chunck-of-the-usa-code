#### § 13257. Fleet requirement program
##### (k) Inclusion of law enforcement vehicles and urban buses

(1) If the Secretary determines, by rule, that the inclusion of fleets of law enforcement motor vehicles in the fleet requirement program established under subsection (g) would contribute to achieving the goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title , and the Secretary finds that such inclusion would not hinder the use of the motor vehicles for law enforcement purposes, the Secretary may include such fleets in such program. The Secretary may only initiate one rulemaking under this paragraph.

(2) If the Secretary determines, by rule, that the inclusion of new urban buses, as defined by the Administrator under title II of the Clean Air Act [ 42 U.S.C. 7521 et seq.], in a fleet requirement program established under subsection (g) would contribute to achieving the goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title , as modified under section 13254 of this title , the Secretary may include such urban buses in such program, if the Secretary finds that such application will be consistent with energy security goals and the needs and objectives of encouraging and facilitating the greater use of such urban buses by the public, taking into consideration the impact of such application on public transit entities. The Secretary may only initiate one rulemaking under this paragraph.

(3) Rulemakings under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be separate from a rulemaking under subsection (g), but may not occur unless a rulemaking is carried out under subsection (g).
