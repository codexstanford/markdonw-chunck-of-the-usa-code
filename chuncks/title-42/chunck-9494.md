#### § 1490p–2. Loan guarantees for multifamily rental housing in rural areas
##### (i) Payment under guarantee

(1) Notice of default

In the event of default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate for the loan shall provide written notice of the default to the Secretary.

(2) Foreclosure

After receiving notice under paragraph (1) and providing written notice of action under this paragraph to the Secretary, the holder of the guarantee certificate for the loan may initiate foreclosure proceedings for the loan in a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, to obtain possession of the security property. After the court issues a final order authorizing foreclosure on the property, the holder of the certificate shall be entitled to payment by the Secretary under the guarantee (in the amount provided under subsection (b)) upon (A) submission to the Secretary of a claim for payment under the guarantee, and (B) assignment to the Secretary of all the claims of the holder of the guarantee against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except claims released with the consent of the Secretary.

(3) Assignment by Secretary

After receiving notice under paragraph (1), the Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that the assignment is in the best interests of the United States. Assignment of a loan under this paragraph shall include conveyance to the Secretary of title to the security property, assignment to the Secretary of all rights and interests arising under the loan, and assignment to the Secretary of all claims against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction. Upon assignment of a loan under this paragraph, the holder of a guarantee certificate for the loan shall be entitled to payment by the Secretary under the guarantee (in the amount provided under subsection (b)).

(4) Requirements

Before any payment under a guarantee is made under paragraph (2) or (3), the holder of the guarantee certificate shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection on the loan guaranteed. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.
