#### § 300mm–31. Identification and initial health evaluation of screening-eligible and certified-eligible WTC survivors
##### (b) Initial health evaluation to determine eligibility for followup monitoring or treatment

(1) In general

In the case of a screening-eligible WTC survivor, the WTC Program shall provide for an initial health evaluation to determine if the survivor has a WTC-related health condition and is eligible for followup monitoring and treatment benefits under the WTC Program. Initial health evaluation protocols under section 300mm–4(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title shall be subject to approval by the WTC Program Administrator.

(2) Initial health evaluation providers

The initial health evaluation described in paragraph (1) shall be provided through a Clinical Center of Excellence with respect to the individual involved.

(3) Limitation on initial health evaluation benefits

Benefits for an initial health evaluation under this subpart for a screening-eligible WTC survivor shall consist only of a single medical initial health evaluation consistent with initial health evaluation protocols described in paragraph (1). Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing such an individual from seeking additional medical initial health evaluations at the expense of the individual.
