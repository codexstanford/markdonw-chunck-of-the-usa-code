#### § 16293. Carbon storage validation and testing
##### (b) Carbon storage program

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercialization for carbon storage.

(2) Program activities

Activities under the program shall include

(A) in coordination with relevant Federal agencies, developing and maintaining mapping tools and resources that assess the capacity of geologic storage formation in the United States;

(B) developing monitoring tools, modeling of geologic formations, and analyses

(i) to predict carbon dioxide containment; and

(ii) to account for sequestered carbon dioxide in geologic storage sites;

(C) researching

(i) potential environmental, safety, and health impacts in the event of a leak into the atmosphere or to an aquifer; and

(ii) any corresponding mitigation actions or responses to limit harmful consequences of such a leak;

(D) evaluating the interactions of carbon dioxide with formation solids and fluids, including the propensity of injections to induce seismic activity;

(E) assessing and ensuring the safety of operations relating to geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide;

(F) determining the fate of carbon dioxide concurrent with and following injection into geologic formations;

(G) supporting cost and business model assessments to examine the economic viability of technologies and systems developed under the program;

(H) providing information to the Environmental Protection Agency, States, local governments, Tribal governments, and other appropriate entities, to ensure the protection of human health and the environment; and

(I) evaluating the quantity, location, and timing of geologic carbon storage deployment that may be needed, and developing strategies and resources to enable the deployment.

(3) Geologic settings

In carrying out research activities under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider a variety of candidate onshore and offshore geologic settings, including

(A) operating oil and gas fields;

(B) depleted oil and gas fields;

(C) residual oil zones;

(D) unconventional reservoirs and rock types;

(E) unmineable coal seams;

(F) saline formations in both sedimentary and basaltic geologies;

(G) geologic systems that may be used as engineered reservoirs to extract economical quantities of brine from geothermal resources of low permeability or porosity; and

(H) geologic systems containing in situ carbon dioxide mineralization formations.
