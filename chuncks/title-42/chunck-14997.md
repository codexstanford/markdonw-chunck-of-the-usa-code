#### § 6803. Development of electric utility rate design proposals by Secretary; contents; submission to Congress; supporting analysis
###### (b) The proposals prepared under subsection (a) shall be transmitted to each House of Congress not later than 6 months after August 14, 1976 , for review and for such further action as the Congress may direct by law. Such proposals shall be accompanied by an analysis of

(1) the projected savings (if any) in consumption of petroleum products, natural gas, electric energy, and other energy resources,

(2) the reduction (if any) in the need for new electrical generating capacity, and of the demand for capital by the electric utility industry, and

(3) changes (if any) in the cost of electric energy to consumers, which are likely to result from the implementation nationally of each of the proposals transmitted under this subsection.
