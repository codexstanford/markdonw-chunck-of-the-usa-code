### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395y. Exclusions from coverage and medicare as secondary payer
##### (d) Items or services provided for emergency medical conditions

For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A), in the case of any item or service that is required to be provided pursuant to section 1395dd of this title to an individual who is entitled to benefits under this subchapter, determinations as to whether the item or service is reasonable and necessary shall be made on the basis of the information available to the treating physician or practitioner (including the patient’s presenting symptoms or complaint) at the time the item or service was ordered or furnished by the physician or practitioner (and not on the patient’s principal diagnosis). When making such determinations with respect to such an item or service, the Secretary shall not consider the frequency with which the item or service was provided to the patient before or after the time of the admission or visit.
