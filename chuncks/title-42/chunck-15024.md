#### § 6834. Federal building energy efficiency standards
##### (a) In general
######## (A) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005 , the Secretary shall establish, by rule, revised Federal building energy efficiency performance standards that require that

(i) if life-cycle cost-effective for new Federal buildings

(I) the buildings be designed to achieve energy consumption levels that are at least 30 percent below the levels established in the version of the ASHRAE Standard or the International Energy Conservation Code, as appropriate, that is in effect as of August 8, 2005 ; and

(II) sustainable design principles are applied to the siting, design, and construction of all new and replacement buildings;

(ii) if water is used to achieve energy efficiency, water conservation technologies shall be applied to the extent that the technologies are life-cycle cost-effective; and

(iii) if lifecycle cost-effective, as compared to other reasonably available technologies, not less than 30 percent of the hot water demand for each new Federal building or Federal building undergoing a major renovation be met through the installation and use of solar hot water heaters.

(B) Not later than 1 year after the date of approval of each subsequent revision of the ASHRAE Standard or the International Energy Conservation Code, as appropriate, the Secretary shall determine, based on the cost-effectiveness of the requirements under the amendment, whether the revised standards established under this paragraph should be updated to reflect the amendment.
