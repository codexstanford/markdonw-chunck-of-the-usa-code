##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the Director should incorporate the findings and recommendations of the report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel entitled “Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context” into the planning process of the Department; and

(2) the nations that lead in particle physics by hosting international teams dedicated to a common scientific goal attract the world’s best talent and inspire future generations of physicists and technologists.
