(3) Performance scores

(A) Total performance score

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall develop a methodology for assessing the total performance of each provider of services and renal dialysis facility based on performance standards with respect to the measures selected under paragraph (2) for a performance period established under paragraph (4)(D) (in this subsection referred to as the “total performance score”).

(ii) Application

For providers of services and renal dialysis facilities that do not meet (or exceed) the total performance score established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall ensure that the application of the methodology developed under clause (i) results in an appropriate distribution of reductions in payment under paragraph (1) among providers and facilities achieving different levels of total performance scores, with providers and facilities achieving the lowest total performance scores receiving the largest reduction in payment under paragraph (1)(A).

(iii) Weighting of measures

In calculating the total performance score, the Secretary shall weight the scores with respect to individual measures calculated under subparagraph (B) to reflect priorities for quality improvement, such as weighting scores to ensure that providers of services and renal dialysis facilities have strong incentives to meet or exceed anemia management and dialysis adequacy performance standards, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.

(B) Performance score with respect to individual measures

The Secretary shall also calculate separate performance scores for each measure, including for dialysis adequacy and anemia management.
