#### § 1320b–11. Blood donor locator service
##### (d) Procedures and safeguards

Any authorized person shall, as a condition for receiving address information from the Blood Donor Locator Service

(1) establish and maintain, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, a system for standardizing records with respect to any request, the reason for such request, and the date of such request made by or of it and any disclosure of address information made by or to it,

(2) establish and maintain, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, a secure area or place in which such address information and all related blood donor records shall be stored,

(3) restrict, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, access to the address information and related blood donor records only to persons whose duties or responsibilities require access and to whom disclosure may be made under the provisions of this section,

(4) provide such other safeguards which the Commissioner of Social Security determines (and which the Commissioner of Social Security prescribes in regulations) to be necessary or appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the address information and related blood donor records,

(5) furnish a report to the Commissioner of Social Security, at such time and containing such information as the Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe, which describes the procedures established and utilized by the authorized person for ensuring the confidentiality of address information and related blood donor records required under this subsection, and

(6) destroy such address information and related blood donor records, upon completion of their use in providing the notification for which the information was obtained, so as to make such information and records undisclosable. If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that any authorized person has failed to, or does not, meet the requirements of this subsection, the Commissioner of Social Security may, after any proceedings for review established under subsection (f), take such actions as are necessary to ensure such requirements are met, including refusing to disclose address information to such authorized person until the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such requirements have been or will be met. In the case of any authorized person who discloses any address information received pursuant to this section or any related blood donor records to any agent, this subsection shall apply to such authorized person and each such agent (except that, in the case of an agent, any report to the Commissioner of Social Security or other action with respect to the Commissioner of Social Security shall be made or taken through such authorized person). The Commissioner of Social Security shall destroy all related blood donor records in the possession of the Social Security Administration upon completion of their use in transmitting mailing addresses as required under subsection (a), so as to make such records undisclosable.
