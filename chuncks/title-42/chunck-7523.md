(1) In general

Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), in the case of a qualifying MA organization, the provisions of sections 1395w–4( o ) and 1395w–4(a)(7) of this title shall apply with respect to eligible professionals described in paragraph (2) of the organization who the organization attests under paragraph (6) to be meaningful EHR users in a similar manner as they apply to eligible professionals under such sections. Incentive payments under paragraph (3) shall be made to and payment adjustments under paragraph (4) shall apply to such qualifying organizations.

(2) Eligible professional described

With respect to a qualifying MA organization, an eligible professional described in this paragraph is an eligible professional (as defined for purposes of section 1395w–4( o ) of this title) who

(A)

(i) is employed by the organization; or

(ii)

(I) is employed by, or is a partner of, an entity that through contract with the organization furnishes at least 80 percent of the entity’s Medicare patient care services to enrollees of such organization; and

(II) furnishes at least 80 percent of the professional services of the eligible professional covered under this subchapter to enrollees of the organization; and

(B) furnishes, on average, at least 20 hours per week of patient care services.

(3) Eligible professional incentive payments

(A) In general

In applying section 1395w–4( o ) of this title under paragraph (1), instead of the additional payment amount under section 1395w–4( o )(1)(A) of this title and subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may substitute an amount determined by the Secretary to the extent feasible and practical to be similar to the estimated amount in the aggregate that would be payable if payment for services furnished by such professionals was payable under part B instead of this part.

(B) Avoiding duplication of payments

(i) In general

In the case of an eligible professional described in paragraph (2)

(I) that is eligible for the maximum incentive payment under section 1395w–4( o )(1)(A) of this title for the same payment period, the payment incentive shall be made only under such section and not under this subsection; and

(II) that is eligible for less than such maximum incentive payment for the same payment period, the payment incentive shall be made only under this subsection and not under section 1395w–4( o )(1)(A) of this title.

(ii) Methods

In the case of an eligible professional described in paragraph (2) who is eligible for an incentive payment under section 1395w–4( o )(1)(A) of this title but is not described in clause (i) for the same payment period, the Secretary shall develop a process

(I) to ensure that duplicate payments are not made with respect to an eligible professional both under this subsection and under section 1395w–4( o )(1)(A) of this title; and

(II) to collect data from Medicare Advantage organizations to ensure against such duplicate payments.

(C) Fixed schedule for application of limitation on incentive payments for all eligible professionals

In applying section 1395w–4( o )(1)(B)(ii) of this title under subparagraph (A), in accordance with rules specified by the Secretary, a qualifying MA organization shall specify a year (not earlier than 2011) that shall be treated as the first payment year for all eligible professionals with respect to such organization.

(4) Payment adjustment

(A) In general

In applying section 1395w–4(a)(7) of this title under paragraph (1), instead of the payment adjustment being an applicable percent of the fee schedule amount for a year under such section, subject to subparagraph (D), the payment adjustment under paragraph (1) shall be equal to the percent specified in subparagraph (B) for such year of the payment amount otherwise provided under this section for such year.

(B) Specified percent

The percent specified under this subparagraph for a year is 100 percent minus a number of percentage points equal to the product of

(i) the number of percentage points by which the applicable percent (under section 1395w–4(a)(7)(A)(ii) of this title ) for the year is less than 100 percent; and

(ii) the Medicare physician expenditure proportion specified in subparagraph (C) for the year.

(C) Medicare physician expenditure proportion

The Medicare physician expenditure proportion under this subparagraph for a year is the Secretary’s estimate of the proportion, of the expenditures under parts A and B that are not attributable to this part, that are attributable to expenditures for physicians’ services.

(D) Application of payment adjustment

In the case that a qualifying MA organization attests that not all eligible professionals of the organization are meaningful EHR users with respect to a year, the Secretary shall apply the payment adjustment under this paragraph based on the proportion of all such eligible professionals of the organization that are not meaningful EHR users for such year.

(5) Qualifying MA organization defined

In this subsection and subsection (m), the term “qualifying MA organization” means a Medicare Advantage organization that is organized as a health maintenance organization (as defined in section 300gg–91(b)(3) of this title ).

(6) Meaningful EHR user attestation

For purposes of this subsection and subsection (m), a qualifying MA organization shall submit an attestation, in a form and manner specified by the Secretary which may include the submission of such attestation as part of submission of the initial bid under section 1395w–24(a)(1)(A)(iv)  4 of this title, identifying

(A) whether each eligible professional described in paragraph (2), with respect to such organization is a meaningful EHR user (as defined in section 1395w–4( o )(2) of this title) for a year specified by the Secretary; and

(B) whether each eligible hospital described in subsection (m)(1), 5 with respect to such organization, is a meaningful EHR user (as defined in section 1395ww(n)(3) of this title ) for an applicable period specified by the Secretary.
