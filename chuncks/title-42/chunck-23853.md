#### § 19132. National Engineering Biology Research and Development Initiative
##### (b) Initiative activities

The activities of the Initiative shall include the following:

(1) Sustained support for engineering biology research and development through the following:

(A) Grants to fund the work of individual investigators and teams of investigators, including interdisciplinary teams.

(B) Projects funded under joint solicitations by a collaboration of not fewer than two agencies participating in the Initiative.

(C) Interdisciplinary research centers that are organized to investigate basic research questions, carry out technology development and demonstration activities, and increase understanding of how to scale up engineering biology processes, including biomanufacturing.

(2) Sustained support for databases and related tools, including the following:

(A) Support for the establishment, curation, and maintenance of curated genomics, epigenomics, and other relevant omics databases, including plant, animal, and microbial databases, that are available to researchers to carry out engineering biology research in a manner that does not compromise national security or the privacy or security of information within such databases.

(B) Development of standards for such databases, including for curation, interoperability, and protection of privacy and security.

(C) Support for the development of computational tools, including artificial intelligence tools, that can accelerate research and innovation using such databases.

(D) An inventory and assessment of all Federal government omics databases to identify opportunities to improve the utility of such databases, as appropriate and in a manner that does not compromise national security or the privacy and security of information within such databases, and inform investment in such databases as critical infrastructure for the engineering biology research enterprise.

(3) Sustained support for the development, optimization, and validation of novel tools and technologies to enable the dynamic study of molecular processes in situ, including through the following:

(A) Research conducted at Federal laboratories.

(B) Grants to fund the work of investigators at institutions of higher education and other nonprofit research institutions.

(C) Incentivized development of retooled industrial sites across the country that foster a pivot to modernized engineering biology initiatives.

(D) Awards under the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (as described in section 638 of title 15 ).

(4) Support for education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in engineering biology, biomanufacturing, bioprocess engineering, and computational science applied to engineering biology and in the related ethical, legal, environmental, safety, security, and other societal domains.

(5) Support for a national network of testbeds based on open standards, interfaces, and processes, including by repurposing existing facilities such as those specified in paragraph (3)(C), that would enable scale up of laboratory engineering biology research.

(6) Activities to develop robust mechanisms for documenting and quantifying the outputs and economic benefits of engineering biology.

(7) Activities to accelerate the translation and commercialization of new products, processes, and technologies by carrying out the following:

(A) Identifying precompetitive research opportunities.

(B) Facilitating public-private partnerships in engineering biology research and development, including to address barriers to scaling up innovations in engineering biology.

(C) Connecting researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows with entrepreneurship education and training opportunities.

(D) Supporting proof of concept activities and the formation of startup companies including through programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program.
