#### § 19052. Research ethics
##### (b) Incorporation of ethics considerations

Drawing on stakeholder input, not later than 24 months after August 9, 2022 , the Director shall revise proposal instructions to require that ethical and societal considerations are to be included as part of a proposal for funding prior to making the award, where such considerations are applicable. Such considerations shall be evaluated by the Director in the review of proposals, taking into account any relevant input from the peer-reviewers for the proposal, and shall factor into award decisions, as deemed necessary by the Director. When incorporating such considerations, proposers may include, as appropriate

(1)

(A) any readily foreseeable or quantifiable risks to society, including how the research could enable products, technologies, or other outcomes that could intentionally or unintentionally cause significant societal harm; or

(B) an assertion that no readily foreseeable potential ethical, social, safety, or security implications are apparent;

(2) how technical or social solutions can mitigate such risks and, as appropriate, a plan to implement such mitigation measures; and

(3) how partnerships and collaborations in the research can help mitigate potential harm and amplify potential societal benefits.
