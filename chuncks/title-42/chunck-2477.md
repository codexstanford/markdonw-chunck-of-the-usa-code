### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 290bb–36b. Mental health and substance use disorder services on campus
##### (e) Requirement of matching funds

(1) In general

The Secretary may make a grant under this section to an institution of higher education only if the institution agrees to make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions in an amount that is not less than $1 for each $1 of Federal funds provided in the grant, toward the costs of activities carried out with the grant (as described in subsection (b)) and other activities by the institution to reduce student mental health and substance use disorders.

(2) Determination of amount contributed

Non-Federal contributions required under paragraph (1) may be in cash or in kind. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.

(3) Waiver

The Secretary may waive the requirement established in paragraph (1) with respect to an institution of higher education if the Secretary determines that extraordinary need at the institution justifies the waiver.
