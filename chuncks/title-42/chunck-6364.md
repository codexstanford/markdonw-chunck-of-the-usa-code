#### § 1103. Amounts transferred to State accounts
##### (f) Special transfers in fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 for modernization
######## (C) Of the maximum incentive payment determined under subparagraph (B) with respect to a State

(i) one-third shall be transferred to the account of such State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the State law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (2); and

(ii) the remainder shall be transferred to the account of such State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the State law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (3).

(2) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law

(A) uses a base period that includes the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment compensation; or

(B) provides that, in the case of an individual who would not otherwise be eligible for unemployment compensation under the State law because of the use of a base period that does not include the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year, eligibility shall be determined using a base period that includes such calendar quarter.

(3) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law includes provisions to carry out at least 2 of the following subparagraphs:

(A) An individual shall not be denied regular unemployment compensation under any State law provisions relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work, solely because such individual is seeking only part-time work (as defined by the Secretary of Labor), except that the State law provisions carrying out this subparagraph may exclude an individual if a majority of the weeks of work in such individual’s base period do not include part-time work (as so defined).

(B) An individual shall not be disqualified from regular unemployment compensation for separating from employment if that separation is for any compelling family reason. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “compelling family reason” means the following:

(i) One or both of the following offenses as selected by the State, but in making such selection, the resulting change in the State law shall not supercede any other provision of law relating to unemployment insurance to the extent that such other provision provides broader access to unemployment benefits for victims of such selected offense or offenses:

(I) Domestic violence, verified by such reasonable and confidential documentation as the State law may require, which causes the individual reasonably to believe that such individual’s continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the individual or of any member of the individual’s immediate family (as defined by the Secretary of Labor); and

(II) Sexual assault, verified by such reasonable and confidential documentation as the State law may require, which causes the individual reasonably to believe that such individual’s continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the individual or of any member of the individual’s immediate family (as defined by the Secretary of Labor).

(ii) The illness or disability of a member of the individual’s immediate family (as those terms are defined by the Secretary of Labor).

(iii) The need for the individual to accompany such individual’s spouse

(I) to a place from which it is impractical for such individual to commute; and

(II) due to a change in location of the spouse’s employment.

(C)

(i) Weekly unemployment compensation is payable under this subparagraph to any individual who is unemployed (as determined under the State unemployment compensation law), has exhausted all rights to regular unemployment compensation under the State law, and is enrolled and making satisfactory progress in a State-approved training program or in a job training program authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, 1 except that such compensation is not required to be paid to an individual who is receiving similar stipends or other training allowances for non-training costs.

(ii) Each State-approved training program or job training program referred to in clause (i) shall prepare individuals who have been separated from a declining occupation, or who have been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the individual’s place of employment, for entry into a high-demand occupation.

(iii) The amount of unemployment compensation payable under this subparagraph to an individual for a week of unemployment shall be equal to

(I) the individual’s average weekly benefit amount (including dependents’ allowances) for the most recent benefit year, less

(II) any deductible income, as determined under State law. The total amount of unemployment compensation payable under this subparagraph to any individual shall be equal to at least 26 times the individual’s average weekly benefit amount (including dependents’ allowances) for the most recent benefit year.

(D) Dependents’ allowances are provided, in the case of any individual who is entitled to receive regular unemployment compensation and who has any dependents (as defined by State law), in an amount equal to at least $15 per dependent per week, subject to any aggregate limitation on such allowances which the State law may establish (but which aggregate limitation on the total allowance for dependents paid to an individual may not be less than $50 for each week of unemployment or 50 percent of the individual’s weekly benefit amount for the benefit year, whichever is less), except that a State law may provide for a reasonable reduction in the amount of any such allowance for a week of less than total unemployment.

(4)

(A) Any State seeking an incentive payment under this subsection shall submit an application therefor at such time, in such manner, and complete with such information as the Secretary of Labor may within 60 days after February 17, 2009 , prescribe (whether by regulation or otherwise), including information relating to compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as well as how the State intends to use the incentive payment to improve or strengthen the State’s unemployment compensation program. The Secretary of Labor shall, within 30 days after receiving a complete application, notify the State agency of the State of the Secretary’s findings with respect to the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) (or both).

(B)

(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds that the State law provisions (disregarding any State law provisions which are not then currently in effect as permanent law or which are subject to discontinuation) meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as the case may be, the Secretary of Labor shall thereupon make a certification to that effect to the Secretary of the Treasury, together with a certification as to the amount of the incentive payment to be transferred to the State account pursuant to that finding. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the appropriate transfer within 7 days after receiving such certification.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i), State law provisions which are to take effect within 12 months after the date of their certification under this subparagraph shall be considered to be in effect as of the date of such certification.

(C)

(i) No certification of compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) may be made with respect to any State whose State law is not otherwise eligible for certification under section 503 of this title or approvable under section 3304 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3304 ].

(ii) No certification of compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3) may be made with respect to any State whose State law is not in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2).

(iii) No application under subparagraph (A) may be considered if submitted before February 17, 2009 , or after the latest date necessary (as specified by the Secretary of Labor) to ensure that all incentive payments under this subsection are made before October 1, 2011 .

(5)

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any amount transferred to the account of a State under this subsection may be used by such State only in the payment of cash benefits to individuals with respect to their unemployment (including for dependents’ allowances and for unemployment compensation under paragraph (3)(C)), exclusive of expenses of administration.

(B) A State may, subject to the same conditions as set forth in subsection (c)(2) (excluding subparagraph (B) thereof, and deeming the reference to “subsections (a) and (b)” in subparagraph (D) thereof to include this subsection), use any amount transferred to the account of such State under this subsection for the administration of its unemployment compensation law and public employment offices.

(6) Out of any money in the Federal unemployment account not otherwise appropriated, the Secretary of the Treasury shall reserve $7,000,000,000 for incentive payments under this subsection. Any amount so reserved shall not be taken into account for purposes of any determination under section 1102, 1110, or 1323 of this title of the amount in the Federal unemployment account as of any given time. Any amount so reserved for which the Secretary of the Treasury has not received a certification under paragraph (4)(B) by the deadline described in paragraph (4)(C)(iii) shall, upon the close of fiscal year 2011, become unrestricted as to use as part of the Federal unemployment account.

(7) For purposes of this subsection, the terms “benefit year”, “base period”, and “week” have the respective meanings given such terms under section 205 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 ( 26 U.S.C. 3304 note).
