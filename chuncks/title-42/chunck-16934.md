### CHAPTER 89— CONGREGATE HOUSING SERVICES
#### § 8004. Congregate services program
##### (g) Amount of annual contributions of receiving agency

Nonprofit corporations and public housing agencies receiving assistance for congregate services programs under this chapter shall be required to maintain the same dollar amount of annual contribution which they were making, if any, in support of the provision of services eligible for assistance under this chapter before the date of the submission of the application for such assistance unless the Secretary determines that the waiver of this requirement is necessary for the maintenance of adequate levels of services to eligible project residents. If any contract or lease entered into by a public housing agency or nonprofit corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section provides for adjustments in payments for services to reflect changes in the cost of living, then the amount of annual contribution required to be maintained by such public agency or nonprofit corporation under the preceding sentence shall be readjusted in the same manner.
