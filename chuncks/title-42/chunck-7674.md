#### § 1395w–141. Medicare prescription drug discount card and transitional assistance program
##### (f) Eligibility procedures for endorsed programs and transitional assistance

(1) Determinations

(A) Procedures

The determination of whether an individual is a discount card eligible individual or a transitional assistance eligible individual or a special transitional assistance eligible individual (as defined in subsection (b)) shall be determined under procedures specified by the Secretary consistent with this subsection.

(B) Income and family size determinations

For purposes of this section, the Secretary shall define the terms “income” and “family size” and shall specify the methods and period for which they are determined. If under such methods income or family size is determined based on the income or family size for prior periods of time, the Secretary shall permit (whether through a process of reconsideration or otherwise) an individual whose income or family size has changed to elect to have eligibility for transitional assistance determined based on income or family size for a more recent period.

(2) Use of self-certification for transitional assistance

(A) In general

Under the procedures specified under paragraph (1)(A) an individual who wishes to be treated as a transitional assistance eligible individual or a special transitional assistance eligible individual under this section (or another qualified person on such individual’s behalf) shall certify on the enrollment form under subsection (c)(1)(B) (or similar form specified by the Secretary), through a simplified means specified by the Secretary and under penalty of perjury or similar sanction for false statements, as to the amount of the individual’s income, family size, and individual’s prescription drug coverage (if any) insofar as they relate to eligibility to be a transitional assistance eligible individual or a special transitional assistance eligible individual. Such certification shall be deemed as consent to verification of respective eligibility under paragraph (3). A certification under this paragraph may be provided before, on, or after the time of enrollment under an endorsed program.

(B) Treatment of self-certification

The Secretary shall treat a certification under subparagraph (A) that is verified under paragraph (3) as a determination that the individual involved is a transitional assistance eligible individual or special transitional assistance eligible individual (as the case may be) for the entire period of the enrollment of the individual in any endorsed program.

(3) Verification

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish methods (which may include the use of sampling and the use of information described in subparagraph (B)) to verify eligibility for individuals who seek to enroll in an endorsed program and for individuals who provide a certification under paragraph (2).

(B) Information described

The information described in this subparagraph is as follows:

(i) Medicaid-related information

Information on eligibility under subchapter XIX and provided to the Secretary under arrangements between the Secretary and States in order to verify the eligibility of individuals who seek to enroll in an endorsed program and of individuals who provide certification under paragraph (2).

(ii) Social security information

Financial information made available to the Secretary under arrangements between the Secretary and the Commissioner of Social Security in order to verify the eligibility of individuals who provide such certification.

(iii) Information from Secretary of the Treasury

Financial information made available to the Secretary under section 6103( l )(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in order to verify the eligibility of individuals who provide such certification.

(C) Verification in cases of medicaid enrollees

(i) In general

Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from finding that a discount card eligible individual meets the income requirements under subsection (b)(2)(A) if the individual is within a category of discount card eligible individuals who are enrolled under subchapter XIX (such as qualified medicare beneficiaries (QMBs), specified low-income medicare beneficiaries (SLMBs), and certain qualified individuals (QI–1s)).

(ii) Availability of information for verification purposes

As a condition of provision of Federal financial participation to a State that is one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia under subchapter XIX, for purposes of carrying out this section, the State shall provide the information it submits to the Secretary relating to such subchapter in a manner specified by the Secretary that permits the Secretary to identify individuals who are described in subsection (b)(1)(B) or are transitional assistance eligible individuals or special transitional assistance eligible individuals.

(4) Reconsideration

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish a process under which a discount card eligible individual, who is determined through the certification and verification methods under paragraphs (2) and (3) not to be a transitional assistance eligible individual or a special transitional assistance eligible individual, may request a reconsideration of the determination.

(B) Contract authority

The Secretary may enter into a contract to perform the reconsiderations requested under subparagraph (A).

(C) Communication of results

Under the process under subparagraph (A) the results of such reconsideration shall be communicated to the individual and the prescription drug card sponsor involved.
