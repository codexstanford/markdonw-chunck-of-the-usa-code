##### (c) Determinations of functional disability

(1) In general

In this section, an individual is “functionally disabled” if the individual

(A) is unable to perform without substantial assistance from another individual at least 2 of the following 3 activities of daily living: toileting, transferring, and eating; or

(B) has a primary or secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and is (i) unable to perform without substantial human assistance (including verbal reminding or physical cueing) or supervision at least 2 of the following 5 activities of daily living: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and eating; or (ii) cognitively impaired so as to require substantial supervision from another individual because he or she engages in inappropriate behaviors that pose serious health or safety hazards to himself or herself or others.

(2) Assessments of functional disability

(A) Requests for assessments

If a State has elected to provide home and community care under this section, upon the request of an individual who is 65 years of age or older and who meets the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(C) (or another person on such individual’s behalf), the State shall provide for a comprehensive functional assessment under this subparagraph which

(i) is used to determine whether or not the individual is functionally disabled,

(ii) is based on a uniform minimum data set specified by the Secretary under subparagraph (C)(i), and

(iii) uses an instrument which has been specified by the State under subparagraph (B). No fee may be charged for such an assessment.

(B) Specification of assessment instrument

The State shall specify the instrument to be used in the State in complying with the requirement of subparagraph (A)(iii) which instrument shall be

(i) one of the instruments designated under subparagraph (C)(ii); or

(ii) an instrument which the Secretary has approved as being consistent with the minimum data set of core elements, common definitions, and utilization guidelines specified by the Secretary in subparagraph (C)(i).

(C) Specification of assessment data set and instruments

The Secretary shall

(i) not later than July 1, 1991

(I) specify a minimum data set of core elements and common definitions for use in conducting the assessments required under subparagraph (A); and

(II) establish guidelines for use of the data set; and

(ii) by not later than July 1, 1991 , designate one or more instruments which are consistent with the specification made under subparagraph (A) and which a State may specify under subparagraph (B) for use in complying with the requirements of subparagraph (A).

(D) Periodic review

Each individual who qualifies as a functionally disabled elderly individual shall have the individual’s assessment periodically reviewed and revised not less often than once every 12 months.

(E) Conduct of assessment by interdisciplinary teams

An assessment under subparagraph (A) and a review under subparagraph (D) must be conducted by an interdisciplinary team designated by the State. The Secretary shall permit a State to provide for assessments and reviews through teams under contracts

(i) with public organizations; or

(ii) with nonpublic organizations which do not provide home and community care or nursing facility services and do not have a direct or indirect ownership or control interest in, or direct or indirect affiliation or relationship with, an entity that provides, community care or nursing facility services.

(F) Contents of assessment

The interdisciplinary team must

(i) identify in each such assessment or review each individual’s functional disabilities and need for home and community care, including information about the individual’s health status, home and community environment, and informal support system; and

(ii) based on such assessment or review, determine whether the individual is (or continues to be) functionally disabled. The results of such an assessment or review shall be used in establishing, reviewing, and revising the individual’s ICCP under subsection (d)(1).

(G) Appeal procedures

Each State which elects to provide home and community care under this section must have in effect an appeals process for individuals adversely affected by determinations under subparagraph (F).
