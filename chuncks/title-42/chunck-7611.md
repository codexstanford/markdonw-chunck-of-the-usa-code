(1) In general

Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the provisions of section 1395w–24(d) of this title shall apply to PDP sponsors and premiums (and any late enrollment penalty) under this part in the same manner as they apply to MA organizations and beneficiary premiums under part C, except that any reference to a Trust Fund is deemed for this purpose a reference to the Medicare Prescription Drug Account.

(2) Crediting of late enrollment penalty

(A) Portion attributable to increased actuarial costs

With respect to late enrollment penalties imposed under subsection (b), the Secretary shall specify the portion of such a penalty that the Secretary estimates is attributable to increased actuarial costs assumed by the PDP sponsor or MA organization (and not taken into account through risk adjustment provided under section 1395w–115(c)(1) of this title or through reinsurance payments under section 1395w–115(b) of this title ) as a result of such late enrollment.

(B) Collection through withholding

In the case of a late enrollment penalty that is collected from a part D eligible individual in the manner described in section 1395w–24(d)(2)(A) of this title , the Secretary shall provide that only the portion of such penalty estimated under subparagraph (A) shall be paid to the PDP sponsor or MA organization offering the part D plan in which the individual is enrolled.

(C) Collection by plan

In the case of a late enrollment penalty that is collected from a part D eligible individual in a manner other than the manner described in section 1395w–24(d)(2)(A) of this title , the Secretary shall establish procedures for reducing payments otherwise made to the PDP sponsor or MA organization by an amount equal to the amount of such penalty less the portion of such penalty estimated under subparagraph (A).

(3) Fallback plans

In applying this subsection in the case of a fallback prescription drug plan, paragraph (2) shall not apply and the monthly beneficiary premium shall be collected in the manner specified in section 1395w–24(d)(2)(A) of this title (or such other manner as may be provided under section 1395s of this title in the case of monthly premiums under section 1395r of this title ).

(4) Collection of monthly adjustment amount

(A) In general

Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or section 1395w–24(d)(2) of this title , subject to subparagraph (B), the amount of the income-related increase in the base beneficiary premium for an individual for a month (as determined under subsection (a)(7)) shall be paid through withholding from benefit payments in the manner provided under section 1395s of this title .

(B) Agreements

In the case where the monthly benefit payments of an individual that are withheld under subparagraph (A) are insufficient to pay the amount described in such subparagraph, the Commissioner of Social Security shall enter into agreements with the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Railroad Retirement Board as necessary in order to allow other agencies to collect the amount described in subparagraph (A) that was not withheld under such subparagraph.
