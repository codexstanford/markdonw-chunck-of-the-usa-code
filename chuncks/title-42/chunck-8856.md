(3) Treatment of other categories

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a State child health plan from providing coverage of benefits that are not within a category of services described in paragraph (1) or (2).

(4) Determination of actuarial value

The actuarial value of coverage of benchmark benefit packages, coverage offered under the State child health plan, and coverage of any categories of additional services under benchmark benefit packages and under coverage offered by such a plan, shall be set forth in an actuarial opinion in an actuarial report that has been prepared

(A) by an individual who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries;

(E) applying the same principles and factors in comparing the value of different coverage (or categories of services);

(F) without taking into account any differences in coverage based on the method of delivery or means of cost control or utilization used; and

(G) taking into account the ability of a State to reduce benefits by taking into account the increase in actuarial value of benefits coverage offered under the State child health plan that results from the limitations on cost sharing under such coverage. The actuary preparing the opinion shall select and specify in the memorandum the standardized set and population to be used under subparagraphs (C) and (D).

(5) Mental health and substance use disorder services

(C) Benchmark dental benefit packages

The benchmark dental benefit packages are as follows:

(ii) State employee dependent dental coverage

A dental benefits plan that is offered and generally available to State employees in the State involved and that has been selected most frequently by employees seeking dependent coverage, among such plans that provide such dependent coverage, in either of the previous 2 plan years.

In applying the previous sentence with respect to requirements under paragraph (8) of section 2726(a) of the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 300gg–26(a) ], a State child health plan described in such sentence shall be treated as in compliance with such requirements if the State child health plan is in compliance with section 457.496 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.

To the extent that a State child health plan includes coverage with respect to an individual described in section 1396d(a)(4)(B) of this title and covered under the State plan under section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title of the services described in section 1396d(a)(4)(B) of this title (relating to early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services defined in section 1396d(r) of this title ) and provided in accordance with section 1396a(a)(43) of this title , such plan shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A).

(8) Construction on prohibited coverage

Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring any health benefits coverage offered under the plan to provide coverage for items or services for which payment is prohibited under this subchapter, notwithstanding that any benchmark benefit package includes coverage for such an item or service.

(9) Availability of coverage for items and services furnished through school-based health centers

Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting a State’s ability to provide child health assistance for covered items and services that are furnished through school-based health centers (as defined in section 1397jj(c)(9) of this title ).

(10) Certain in vitro diagnostic products for COVID–19 testing
