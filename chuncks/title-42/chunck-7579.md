(II) Establishment of thresholds

For purposes of subclause (I) and subject to subclause (III), the Secretary shall, after consultation with stakeholders, establish thresholds, based on prescriber specialty and geographic area, for identifying whether a prescriber in a specialty and geographic area is an outlier prescriber of opioids as compared to other prescribers of opioids within such specialty and area.

The Secretary shall determine the length of the period for which such prescriber is required to maintain such enrollment, which shall be the minimum period necessary to correct such prescribing patterns.
