##### (d) Rate conditions and criteria

(1) Definitions

In this subsection:

(A) Per unit distribution costs

The term “per unit distribution costs” means (in kilowatt hours) the quotient obtained by dividing

(i) the depreciated book-value distribution system costs of a utility; by

(ii) the volume of utility electricity sales or transmission during the previous year at the distribution level.

(B) Per unit distribution margin

The term “per unit distribution margin” means

(i) in the case of a State-regulated electric utility, a per-unit gross pretax profit equal to the product obtained by multiplying

(I) the State-approved percentage rate of return for the utility for distribution system assets; by

(II) the per unit distribution costs; and

(ii) in the case of a nonregulated utility, a per unit contribution to net revenues determined multiplying

(I) the percentage (but not less than 10 percent) obtained by dividing

(aa) the amount of any net revenue payment or contribution to the owners or subscribers of the nonregulated utility during the prior year; by

(bb) the gross revenues of the utility during the prior year to obtain a percentage; by

(II) the per unit distribution costs.

(C) Per unit transmission costs

The term “per unit transmission costs” means the total cost of those transmission services purchased or provided by a utility on a per-kilowatt-hour basis as included in the retail rate of the utility.

(2) Options

The options described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in subsection (c) shall be offered under purchase and transport rate conditions that reflect the rate components defined under paragraph (1) as applicable under the circumstances described in paragraph (3).

(3) Applicable rates

(A) Rates applicable to sale of net excess power

(i) In general

Sales made by a project owner or operator of a facility under the option described in subsection (c)(1) shall be paid for on a per kilowatt hour basis that shall equal the full undiscounted retail rate paid to the utility for power purchased by the facility minus per unit distribution costs, that applies to the type of utility purchasing the power.

(ii) Voltages exceeding 25 kilovolts

If the net excess power is made available for purchase at voltages that must be transformed to or from voltages exceeding 25 kilovolts to be available for resale by the utility, the purchase price shall further be reduced by per unit transmission costs.

(B) Rates applicable to transport by utility for direct sale to third parties

(i) In general

Transportation by utilities of power on behalf of the owner or operator of a project under the option described in subsection (c)(2) shall incur a transportation rate that shall equal the per unit distribution costs and per unit distribution margin, that applies to the type of utility transporting the power.

(ii) Voltages exceeding 25 kilovolts

If the net excess power is made available for transportation at voltages that must be transformed to or from voltages exceeding 25 kilovolts to be transported to the designated third-party purchasers, the transport rate shall further be increased by per unit transmission costs.

(iii) States with competitive retail markets for electricity

In a State with a competitive retail market for electricity, the applicable transportation rate for similar transportation shall be applied in lieu of any rate calculated under this paragraph.

(4) Limitations

(A) In general

Any rate established for sale or transportation under this section shall

(i) be modified over time with changes in the underlying costs or rates of the electric utility; and

(ii) reflect the same time-sensitivity and billing periods as are established in the retail sales or transportation rates offered by the utility.

(B) Limitation

No utility shall be required to purchase or transport a quantity of net excess power under this section that exceeds the available capacity of the wires, meter, or other equipment of the electric utility serving the site unless the owner or operator of the project agrees to pay necessary and reasonable upgrade costs.
