#### § 1395yy. Payment to skilled nursing facilities for routine service costs
##### (d) Access to skilled nursing facilities
######## (B) Subject to the limitations of subparagraph (C), for skilled nursing facilities located

(i) in an urban area, the amount shall be equal to 105 percent of the mean of the per diem reasonable routine service and capital-related costs of extended care services for skilled nursing facilities in urban areas within the same region, determined without regard to the limitations of subsection (a) and adjusted for different area wage levels, and

(ii) in a rural area the amount shall be equal to 105 percent of the mean of the per diem reasonable routine service and capital-related costs of extended care services for skilled nursing facilities in rural areas within the same region, determined without regard to the limitations of subsection (a) and adjusted for different area wage levels.

(C) The per diem amounts determined under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the limit on routine service costs determined under subsection (a) with respect to the facility, adjusted to take into account average capital-related costs with respect to the type and location of the facility.

(3) For purposes of this subsection, urban and rural areas shall be determined in the same manner as for purposes of subsection (a), and the term “region” shall have the same meaning as under section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title .

(4) The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts for cost reporting periods beginning in a fiscal year at least 90 days prior to the beginning of such fiscal year, on the basis of the most recent data available for a 12-month period. A skilled nursing facility must notify the Secretary of its intention to be paid pursuant to this subsection for a cost reporting period no later than 30 days before the beginning of that period.

(5) The Secretary shall provide for a simplified cost report to be filed by facilities being paid pursuant to this subsection, which shall require only the cost information necessary for determining prospective payment amounts pursuant to paragraph (2) and reasonable costs of ancillary services.

(6) In lieu of payment on a cost basis for ancillary services provided by a facility which is being paid pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary may pay for such ancillary services on a reasonable charge basis if the Secretary determines that such payment basis will provide an equitable level of reimbursement and will ease the reporting burden of the facility.

(7) In computing the rates of payment to be made under this subsection, there shall be taken into account the costs described in the last sentence of section 1395x(v)(1)(E) of this title (relating to compliance with nursing facility requirements and of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs).
