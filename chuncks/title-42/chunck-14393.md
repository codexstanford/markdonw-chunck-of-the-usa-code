Upon introduction in the Senate, the joint resolution shall be referred in the Senate immediately to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.

(2) This subsection is enacted by the Congress

(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and as such it is deemed a part of the rules of the Senate, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the Senate in the case of resolutions described by paragraph (3); it supersedes other rules only to the extent that is inconsistent therewith; and

(B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the Senate to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of the Senate) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.

(3) The joint resolution disapproving the transmission under subsection (m) shall read as follows after the resolving clause: “That the Congress of the United States disapproves the availability of the defenses pursuant to section 252 (f) and (j) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with respect to Type 1 activities under the plan of action submitted to the Congress by the Secretary of Energy on        .”, the blank space therein being filled with the date and year of receipt by the Congress of the plan of action transmitted as described in subsection (m).

(4)

(A) If the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate has not reported a joint resolution referred to it under this subsection at the end of 20 calendar days of continuous session after its referral, it shall be in order to move either to discharge the committee from further consideration of such resolution or to discharge the committee from further consideration of any other joint resolution which has been referred to the committee with respect to such plan of action.

(B) A motion to discharge shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has reported a joint resolution with respect to the plan of action), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than one hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the joint resolution. An amendment to the motion shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion was agreed to or disagreed to.

(C) If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other joint resolution with respect to the same transmission.

(5)

(A) When the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate has reported or has been discharged from further consideration of a joint resolution, it shall be in order at any time thereafter within the 90-day period following receipt by the Congress of the plan of action (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of such joint resolution. The motion shall be highly privileged and shall not be debatable. An amendment to the motion shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider a vote by which the motion was agreed to or disagreed to.

(B) Debate on the joint resolution shall be limited to not more than 10 hours and final action on the joint resolution shall occur immediately following conclusion of such debate. A motion further to limit debate shall not be debatable. A motion to recommit such a joint resolution shall not be in order, and it shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote by which such a joint resolution was agreed to or disagreed to.

(6)

(A) Motions to postpone made with respect to the discharge from committee or consideration of a joint resolution, shall be decided without debate.

(B) Appeals from the decision of the Chair relating to the application of rules of the Senate to the procedures relating to a joint resolution shall be decided without debate.
