#### § 16161a. Regional clean hydrogen hubs
##### (c) Selection of regional clean hydrogen hubs

(1) Solicitation of proposals

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021 , the Secretary shall solicit proposals for regional clean hydrogen hubs.

(2) Selection of hubs

Not later than 1 year after the deadline for the submission of proposals under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall select at least 4 regional clean hydrogen hubs to be developed under subsection (b).

(3) Criteria

The Secretary shall select regional clean hydrogen hubs under paragraph (2) using the following criteria:

(A) Feedstock diversity

To the maximum extent practicable

(i) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the production of clean hydrogen from fossil fuels;

(ii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the production of clean hydrogen from renewable energy; and

(iii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the production of clean hydrogen from nuclear energy.

(B) End-use diversity

To the maximum extent practicable

(i) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the electric power generation sector;

(ii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the industrial sector;

(iii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the residential and commercial heating sector; and

(iv) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the transportation sector.

(C) Geographic diversity

To the maximum extent practicable, each regional clean hydrogen hub

(i) shall be located in a different region of the United States; and

(ii) shall use energy resources that are abundant in that region.

(D) Hubs in natural gas-producing regions

To the maximum extent practicable, at least 2 regional clean hydrogen hubs shall be located in the regions of the United States with the greatest natural gas resources.

(E) Employment

The Secretary shall give priority to regional clean hydrogen hubs that are likely to create opportunities for skilled training and long-term employment to the greatest number of residents of the region.

(F) Additional criteria

The Secretary may take into consideration other criteria that, in the judgment of the Secretary, are necessary or appropriate to carry out this subchapter  1

(4) Funding of regional clean hydrogen hubs

The Secretary may make grants to each regional clean hydrogen hub selected under paragraph (2) to accelerate commercialization of, and demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end-use of, clean hydrogen.
