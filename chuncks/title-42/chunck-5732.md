##### (c) Denial of certification; availability of records to Railroad Retirement Board; cooperation with Federal agencies

The Secretary of Labor shall make no certification for payment to any State if he finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency charged with the administration of the State law

(1) that such State does not make its records available to the Railroad Retirement Board, and furnish to the Railroad Retirement Board at the expense of the Railroad Retirement Board such copies thereof as the Railroad Retirement Board deems necessary for its purposes;

(2) that such State is failing to afford reasonable cooperation with every agency of the United States charged with the administration of any unemployment insurance law; or

(3) that any interest required to be paid on advances under subchapter XII of this chapter has not been paid by the date on which such interest is required to be paid or has been paid directly or indirectly (by an equivalent reduction in State unemployment taxes or otherwise) by such State from amounts in such State’s unemployment fund, until such interest is properly paid.
