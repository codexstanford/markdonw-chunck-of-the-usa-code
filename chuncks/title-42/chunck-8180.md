#### § 1395bbb. Conditions of participation for home health agencies; home health quality
##### (c) Surveys of home health agencies
######## (C) A standard survey conducted under this paragraph with respect to a home health agency

(i) shall include (to the extent practicable), for a case-mix stratified sample of individuals furnished items or services by the agency

(I) visits to the homes of such individuals, but only with the consent of such individuals, for the purpose of evaluating (in accordance with a standardized reproducible assessment instrument (or instruments) approved by the Secretary under subsection (d)) the extent to which the quality and scope of items and services furnished by the agency attained and maintained the highest practicable functional capacity of each such individual as reflected in such individual’s written plan of care required under section 1395x(m) of this title and clinical records required under section 1395x( o )(3) of this title; and

(II) a survey of the quality of care and services furnished by the agency as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care;

(ii) shall be based upon a protocol that is developed, tested, and validated by the Secretary not later than January 1, 1989 ; and

(iii) shall be conducted by an individual

(I) who meets minimum qualifications established by the Secretary not later than July 1, 1989 ,

(II) who is not serving (or has not served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the home health agency surveyed respecting compliance with the conditions of participation specified in or pursuant to section 1395x( o ) of this title or subsection (a) of this section, and

(III) who has no personal or familial financial interest in the home health agency surveyed.

(D) Each home health agency that is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard care shall be subject to an extended survey to review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard care and to determine whether the agency has complied with the conditions of participation specified in or pursuant to section 1395x( o ) of this title or subsection (a) of this section. Any other agency may, at the Secretary’s or State’s discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey). The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practical, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).

(E) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended (or partial extended) survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against an agency under subsection (e) on the basis of the findings of a standard survey.
