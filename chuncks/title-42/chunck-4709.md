(vi) Counting of cases in areas with exemptions

(I) In general

With respect to a State that is under a reporting system for living non-AIDS cases of HIV that is not names-based (referred to in this subparagraph as “code-based reporting”), the Secretary shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, modify the number of such cases reported for the State in order to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems that use code-based reporting.

(II) Adjustment rate

The adjustment rate under subclause (I) for a State shall be a reduction of 5 percent for fiscal years before fiscal year 2012 (and 6 percent for fiscal year 2012) in the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV reported for the State.

(III) Increased adjustment for certain States previously using code-based reporting

For purposes of this subparagraph for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the Secretary shall deem the applicable number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in a State that were reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be 3 percent higher than the actual number if

(II) Applicability of exemption requirements

The provisions of clauses (ii) through (vii) may not be construed as having any legal effect for fiscal year 2013 or any subsequent fiscal year, and accordingly, the status of a State for purposes of such clauses may not be considered after fiscal year 2012.

(ix) Program for detecting inaccurate or fraudulent counting

The Secretary shall carry out a program to monitor the reporting of names-based cases for purposes of this subparagraph and to detect instances of inaccurate reporting, including fraudulent reporting.

(x) Future fiscal years

For fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2013, determinations under this paragraph shall be based only on living names-based cases of HIV/AIDS with respect to the State involved.

(E) Code-based States; limitation on increase in grant

(i) In general

For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, if code-based reporting (within the meaning of subparagraph (D)(vi)) applies in a State as of the beginning of the fiscal year involved, then notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount of the grant pursuant to paragraph (1) for the State may not for the fiscal year involved exceed by more than 5 percent the amount of the grant pursuant to this paragraph for the State for the preceding fiscal year, except that the limitation under this clause may not result in a grant pursuant to paragraph (1) for a fiscal year that is less than the minimum amount that applies to the State under such paragraph for such fiscal year.

(ii) Use of amounts involved

For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, amounts available as a result of the limitation under clause (i) shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants pursuant to section 300ff–29a of this title , subject to subparagraph (H).

(F) Appropriations for treatment drug program

(i) Formula grants

With respect to the fiscal year involved, if under section 300ff–31b of this title an appropriations Act provides an amount exclusively for carrying out section 300ff–26 of this title , the portion of such amount allocated to a State shall be the product of

(I) 100 percent of such amount, less the percentage reserved under clause (ii)(V); and

(II) the percentage constituted by the ratio of the State distribution factor for the State (as determined under subparagraph (B)) to the sum of the State distribution factors for all States;  which product shall then, as applicable, be increased under subparagraph (H).

(ii) Supplemental treatment drug grants

(I) In general

From amounts made available under subclause (V), the Secretary shall award supplemental grants to States described in subclause (II) to enable such States to purchase and distribute to eligible individuals under section 300ff–26(b) of this title pharmaceutical therapeutics described under subsections (c)(2) and (e) of such section.

(II) Eligible States

For purposes of subclause (I), a State shall be an eligible State if the State did not have unobligated funds subject to reallocation under subsection (d) in the previous fiscal year and, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, demonstrates a severe need for a grant under this clause. For purposes of determining severe need, the Secretary shall consider eligibility standards, formulary composition, the number of eligible individuals to whom a State is unable to provide therapeutics described in section 300ff–26(a) of this title , and an unanticipated increase of eligible individuals with HIV/AIDS.

(III) State requirements

The Secretary may not make a grant to a State under this clause unless the State agrees that the State will make available (directly or through donations of public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward the activities to be carried out under the grant in an amount equal to $1 for each $4 of Federal funds provided in the grant, except that the Secretary may waive this subclause if the State has otherwise fully complied with section 300ff–27(d) of this title with respect to the grant year involved. The provisions of this subclause shall apply to States that are not required to comply with such section 300ff–27(d) of this title .

(IV) Use and coordination

Amounts made available under a grant under this clause shall only be used by the State to provide HIV/AIDS-related medications. The State shall coordinate the use of such amounts with the amounts otherwise provided under section 300ff–26(a) of this title in order to maximize drug coverage.

(V) Funding

For the purpose of making grants under this clause, the Secretary shall each fiscal year reserve 5 percent of the amount referred to in clause (i) with respect to section 300ff–26 of this title .

(iii) Code-based States; limitation on increase in formula grant

The limitation under subparagraph (E)(i) applies to grants pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph to the same extent and in the same manner as such limitation applies to grants pursuant to paragraph (1), except that the reference to minimum grants does not apply for purposes of this clause. Amounts available as a result of the limitation under the preceding sentence shall be made available by the Secretary as additional amounts for grants under clause (ii) of this subparagraph.

From the amount reserved under section 300ff–31b(b)(2) of this title for a fiscal year, and from amounts available for such section pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall make available such amounts as may be necessary to comply with clause (i).

(II) Pro rata reduction

If the amounts referred to in subclause (I) for a fiscal year are insufficient to fully comply with clause (i) for the year, the Secretary, in order to provide the additional funds necessary for such compliance, shall reduce on a pro rata basis the amount of each grant pursuant to paragraph (1) for the fiscal year, other than grants for States for which increases under clause (i) apply and other than States described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).
