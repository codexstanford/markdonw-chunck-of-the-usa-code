### CHAPTER 92— POWERPLANT AND INDUSTRIAL FUEL USE
#### § 8352. Permanent exemptions
##### (f) Permanent exemption for peakload powerplants

After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption from one or more of the prohibitions of part A for a powerplant, the Secretary shall, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection, if he finds that

(1) the powerplant is operated solely as a peakload powerplant;

(2) a denial of such petition is likely to result in an impairment of reliability of service; and

(3)

(A) modification of the powerplant to permit compliance with such prohibitions is technically infeasible; or

(B) such modification would result in an unreasonable expense.
