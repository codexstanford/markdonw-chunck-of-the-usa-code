#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (o) Restrictions on authorized payments to States

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, no payment shall be made to a State under the preceding provisions of this section for expenditures for medical assistance provided for an individual under its State plan approved under this subchapter to the extent that a private insurer (as defined by the Secretary by regulation and including a group health plan (as defined in section 1167(1) of title 29 ), a service benefit plan, and a health maintenance organization) would have been obligated to provide such assistance but for a provision of its insurance contract which has the effect of limiting or excluding such obligation because the individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance under the plan.
