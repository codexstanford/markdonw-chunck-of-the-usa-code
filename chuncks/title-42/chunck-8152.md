(3) Determination of facility specific per diem rates

The Secretary shall determine a facility-specific per diem rate for each skilled nursing facility not described in paragraph (2)(E)(ii) for a cost reporting period as follows:

(A) Determining base payments

The Secretary shall determine, on a per diem basis, the total of

(i) the allowable costs of extended care services for the facility for cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 1995, including costs associated with facilities described in subsection (d), with appropriate adjustments (as determined by the Secretary) to non-settled cost reports or, in the case of a facility participating in the Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration (RUGS–III), the RUGS–III rate received by the facility during the cost reporting period beginning in 1997, and

(ii) an estimate of the amounts that would be payable under part B (disregarding any applicable deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments) for covered skilled nursing facility services described in paragraph (2)(A)(i)(II) furnished during the applicable cost reporting period described in clause (i) to an individual who is a resident of the facility, regardless of whether or not the payment was made to the facility or to another entity. In making appropriate adjustments under clause (i), the Secretary shall take into account exceptions and shall take into account exemptions but, with respect to exemptions, only to the extent that routine costs do not exceed 150 percent of the routine cost limits otherwise applicable but for the exemption.

(B) Update to first cost reporting period

The Secretary shall update the amount determined under subparagraph (A), for each cost reporting period after the applicable cost reporting period described in subparagraph (A)(i) and up to the first cost reporting period by a factor equal to the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage increase minus 1.0 percentage point.

(C) Updating to applicable cost reporting period

The Secretary shall update the amount determined under subparagraph (B) for each cost reporting period beginning with the first cost reporting period and up to and including the cost reporting period involved by a factor equal to the facility-specific update factor.

(D) Facility-specific update factor

For purposes of this paragraph, the “facility-specific update factor” for cost reporting periods beginning during

(i) during each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999, is equal to the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage increase for such fiscal year minus 1 percentage point, and

(ii) during each subsequent fiscal year is equal to the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage increase for such fiscal year.

(4) Federal per diem rate

(A) Determination of historical per diem for facilities

For each skilled nursing facility that received payments for post-hospital extended care services during a cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1995 and that was subject to (and not exempted from) the per diem limits referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) (and facilities described in subsection (d)), the Secretary shall estimate, on a per diem basis for such cost reporting period, the total of

(i) the allowable costs of extended care services (excluding exceptions payments) for the facility for cost reporting periods beginning in 1995 with appropriate adjustments (as determined by the Secretary) to non-settled cost reports, and

(ii) an estimate of the amounts that would be payable under part B (disregarding any applicable deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments) for covered skilled nursing facility services described in paragraph (2)(A)(i)(II) furnished during such period to an individual who is a resident of the facility, regardless of whether or not the payment was made to the facility or to another entity.

(B) Update to first fiscal year

The Secretary shall update the amount determined under subparagraph (A), for each cost reporting period after the cost reporting period described in subparagraph (A)(i) and up to the first cost reporting period by a factor equal to the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage increase reduced (on an annualized basis) by 1 percentage point.

(C) Computation of standardized per diem rate

The Secretary shall standardize the amount updated under subparagraph (B) for each facility by

(i) adjusting for variations among facilities by area in the average facility wage level per diem, and

(ii) adjusting for variations in case mix per diem among facilities.

(D) Computation of weighted average per diem rates

(i) All facilities

The Secretary shall compute a weighted average per diem rate for all facilities by computing an average of the standardized amounts computed under subparagraph (C), weighted for each facility by the number of days of extended care services furnished during the cost reporting period referred to in subparagraph (A).

(ii) Freestanding facilities

The Secretary shall compute a weighted average per diem rate for freestanding facilities by computing an average of the standardized amounts computed under subparagraph (C) only for such facilities, weighted for each facility by the number of days of extended care services furnished during the cost reporting period referred to in subparagraph (A).

(iii) Separate computation

The Secretary may compute and apply such averages separately for facilities located in urban and rural areas (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title ).

(E) Updating

(i) Initial period

For the initial period beginning on July 1, 1998 , and ending on September 30, 1999 , the Secretary shall compute for skilled nursing facilities an unadjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the average of the weighted average per diem rates computed under clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (D), increased by skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for such period minus 1 percentage point.

(ii) Subsequent fiscal years

The Secretary shall compute an unadjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the Federal per diem rate computed under this subparagraph

(I) for fiscal year 2000, the rate computed for the initial period described in clause (i), increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the initial period minus 1 percentage point;

(II) for fiscal year 2001, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year;

(III) for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year involved minus 0.5 percentage points; and

(IV) for each subsequent fiscal year, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year involved.

(F) Adjustment for case mix creep

Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments under subparagraph (G)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of residents that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust unadjusted Federal per diem rates for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.

(G) Determination of Federal rate

The Secretary shall compute for each skilled nursing facility for each fiscal year (beginning with the initial period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) an adjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the unadjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subparagraph (E), as adjusted under subparagraph (F), and as further adjusted as follows:

(i) Adjustment for case mix

The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to account for case mix. Such adjustment shall be based on a resident classification system, established by the Secretary, that accounts for the relative resource utilization of different patient types. The case mix adjustment shall be based on resident assessment data and other data that the Secretary considers appropriate.

(ii) Adjustment for geographic variations in labor costs

The Secretary shall adjust the portion of such per diem rate attributable to wages and wage-related costs for the area in which the facility is located compared to the national average of such costs using an appropriate wage index as determined by the Secretary. Such adjustment shall be done in a manner that does not result in aggregate payments under this subsection that are greater or less than those that would otherwise be made if such adjustment had not been made.

(iii) Adjustment for exclusion of certain additional items and services

The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate proportional reduction in payments so that beginning with fiscal year 2001, the aggregate amount of such reductions is equal to the aggregate increase in payments attributable to the exclusion effected under clause (iii) of paragraph (2)(A).

(H) Publication of information on per diem rates

The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, before May 1, 1998 (with respect to fiscal period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) and before the August 1 preceding each succeeding fiscal year (with respect to that succeeding fiscal year), of

(i) the unadjusted Federal per diem rates to be applied to days of covered skilled nursing facility services furnished during the fiscal year,

(ii) the case mix classification system to be applied under subparagraph (G)(i) with respect to such services during the fiscal year, and

(iii) the factors to be applied in making the area wage adjustment under subparagraph (G)(ii) with respect to such services.

(5) Skilled nursing facility market basket index and percentage

For purposes of this subsection:

(A) Skilled nursing facility market basket index

The Secretary shall establish a skilled nursing facility market basket index that reflects changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in covered skilled nursing facility services.

(B) Skilled nursing facility market basket percentage

(i) In general

Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), the term “skilled nursing facility market basket percentage” means, for a fiscal year or other annual period and as calculated by the Secretary, the percentage change in the skilled nursing facility market basket index (established under subparagraph (A)) from the midpoint of the prior fiscal year (or period) to the midpoint of the fiscal year (or other period) involved.

(ii) Adjustment

For fiscal year 2012 and each subsequent fiscal year, subject to clauses (iii) and (iv), after determining the percentage described in clause (i), the Secretary shall reduce such percentage by the productivity adjustment described in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of this title . The application of the preceding sentence may result in such percentage being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under this subsection for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.

(iii) Special rule for fiscal year 2018

For fiscal year 2018 (or other similar annual period specified in clause (i)), the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage, after application of clause (ii), is equal to 1 percent.

(iv) Special rule for fiscal year 2019

For fiscal year 2019 (or other similar annual period specified in clause (i)), the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage, after application of clause (ii), is equal to 2.4 percent.

(6) Reporting of assessment and quality data

(A) Reduction in update for failure to report

(i) In general
