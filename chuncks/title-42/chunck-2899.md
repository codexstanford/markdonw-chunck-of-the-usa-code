### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 292r. Loan provisions
##### (a) Amount of loan

(1) In general

Loans from a student loan fund (established under an agreement with a school under section 292q of this title ) may not, subject to paragraph (2), exceed for any student for a school year (or its equivalent) the cost of attendance (including tuition, other reasonable educational expenses, and reasonable living costs) for that year at the educational institution attended by the student (as determined by such educational institution).

(2) Third and fourth years of medical school

For purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of the loan may, in the case of the third or fourth year of a student at a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine, be increased to the extent necessary to pay the balances of loans that, from sources other than the student loan fund under section 292q of this title , were made to the individual for attendance at the school. The authority to make such an increase is subject to the school and the student agreeing that such amount (as increased) will be expended to pay such balances.
