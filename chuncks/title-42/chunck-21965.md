##### (c) Spallation Neutron Source Facility plan

(1) In general

The Secretary shall develop an operational plan for the Spallation Neutron Source Facility that ensures that the Facility is employed to the full capability of the Facility in support of the study of advanced materials, nanoscience, and other missions of the Office of Science of the Department.

(2) Plan

The operational plan shall

(A) include a plan for the operation of an effective scientific user program that

(i) is based on peer review of proposals submitted for use of the Facility;

(ii) includes scientific and technical support to ensure that external users, including researchers based at institutions of higher education, are able to make full use of a variety of high quality scientific instruments; and

(iii) phases in systems upgrades to ensure that the Facility remains at the forefront of international scientific endeavors in the field of the Facility throughout the operating life of the Facility;

(B) include an ongoing program to develop new instruments that builds on the high performance neutron source and that allows neutron scattering techniques to be applied to a growing range of scientific problems and disciplines; and

(C) address the status of and, to the maximum extent practicable, costs and schedules for

(i) full user mode operations of the Facility;

(ii) instrumentation built at the Facility during the operating phase through full use of the experimental hall, including the SING;

(iii) the SNS power upgrade; and

(iv) the SNS second target station.
