(1) A grant under section 5306 or 5318 of this title may be made only if the grantee certifies that it is following a residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan. A grantee receiving a grant under section 5306(a) of this title or section 5318 of this title shall so certify to the Secretary.

(A) in the event of such displacement, provide that

(i) governmental agencies or private developers shall provide within the same community comparable replacement dwellings for the same number of occupants as could have been housed in the occupied and vacant occupiable low and moderate income dwelling units demolished or converted to a use other than for housing for low and moderate income persons, and provide that such replacement housing may include existing housing assisted with project based assistance provided under section 1437f of this title ;

(ii) such comparable replacement dwellings shall be designed to remain affordable to persons of low and moderate income for 10 years from the time of initial occupancy;

(I) compensation sufficient to ensure that, for a 5-year period, the displaced families shall not bear, after relocation, a ratio of shelter costs to income that exceeds 30 percent; or

(II) if elected by a family, a lump-sum payment equal to the capitalized value of the benefits available under subclause (I) to permit the household to secure participation in a housing cooperative or mutual housing association; and

(C) provide that where a claim for assistance under subparagraph (A)(iv) is denied by a grantee, the claimant may appeal to the Secretary in the case of a grant under section 5306 or 5318 of this title or to the appropriate State official in the case of a grant under section 5306(d) of this title , and that the decision of the Secretary or the State official shall be final unless a court determines the decision was arbitrary and capricious.

(3) Paragraphs (2)(A)(i) and (2)(A)(ii) shall not apply in any case in which the Secretary finds, on the basis of objective data, that there is available in the area an adequate supply of habitable affordable housing for low and moderate income persons. A determination under this paragraph is final and nonreviewable.
