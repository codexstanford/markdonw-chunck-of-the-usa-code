(5) Adjustments to import limitations

(A) In general

The import limitations described in paragraph (2)(A) are based on the lower scenario data in the report of the World Nuclear Association entitled “The Nuclear Fuel Report: Global Scenarios for Demand and Supply Availability 2019–2040”. In each of calendar years 2023, 2029, and 2035, the Secretary of Commerce shall review the projected demand for uranium for nuclear reactors in the United States and adjust the import limitations described in paragraph (2)(A) to account for changes in such demand in years after the year in which that report or a subsequent report is published.

(B) Report required

Not later than one year after December 27, 2020 , and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that includes

(i) a recommendation on the use of all publicly available data to ensure accurate forecasting by scenario data to comport to actual demand for low-enriched uranium for nuclear reactors in the United States; and

(ii) an identification of the steps to be taken to adjust the import limitations described in paragraph (2)(A) based on the most accurate scenario data.

(C) Incentive adjustment

Beginning in the second calendar year after the calendar year of the completion of the Russian HEU Agreement, the Secretary of Energy shall increase or decrease the amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported in a calendar year under paragraph (2)(C) (including the amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported for each kilogram of highly enriched uranium downblended under paragraph (2)(C)(i)) by a percentage equal to the percentage increase or decrease, as the case may be, in the average amount of uranium loaded into nuclear power reactors in the United States in the most recent 3-calendar-year period for which data are available, as reported by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy, compared to the average amount of uranium loaded into such reactors during the 3-calendar-year period beginning on January 1, 2011 , as reported by the Energy Information Administration.

(D) Publication of adjustments

As soon as practicable, but not later than July 31 of each calendar year, the Secretary of Energy shall publish in the Federal Register the amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported in the current calendar year after the adjustments under subparagraph (C).

(6) Authority for additional adjustment

In addition to the adjustment under paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary of Commerce may adjust the import limitations under paragraph (2)(A) for a calendar year if the Secretary

(A) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, determines that the available supply of low-enriched uranium and the available stockpiles of uranium of the Department of Energy are insufficient to meet demand in the United States in the following calendar year; and

(B) notifies Congress of the adjustment not less than 45 days before making the adjustment.

(7) Equivalent quantities of low-enriched uranium imports

(A) In general

The import limitations described in paragraphs (1) and (2) are expressed in terms of uranium containing 4.4 percent uranium-235 and a tails assay of 0.3 percent.

(B) Adjustment for other uranium

Imports of low-enriched uranium under paragraphs (1) and (2), including low-enriched uranium obtained under contracts for separative work units, shall count against the import limitations described in such paragraphs in amounts calculated as the quantity of low-enriched uranium containing 4.4 percent uranium-235 necessary to equal the total amount of uranium-235 contained in such imports.

(8) Downblending of other highly enriched uranium

(A) In general

The downblending of highly enriched uranium not of weapons origin may be counted for purposes of paragraph (2)(C), subject to verification under paragraph (10), if the Secretary of Energy determines that the highly enriched uranium to be downblended poses a risk to the national security of the United States.

(B) Equivalent quantities of highly enriched uranium

For purposes of determining the additional low-enriched uranium imports allowed under paragraph (2)(C), highly enriched uranium not of weapons origin downblended pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall count as downblended highly enriched uranium of weapons origin in amounts calculated as the quantity of highly enriched uranium containing 90 percent uranium-235 necessary to equal the total amount of uranium-235 contained in the highly enriched uranium not of weapons origin downblended pursuant to subparagraph (A).

(9) Termination of import restrictions

The provisions of this subsection shall terminate on December 31, 2040 .

(10) Technical verifications by Secretary of Energy
