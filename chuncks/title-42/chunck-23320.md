(2) Facility capabilities

The Secretary shall ensure that the facility described in paragraph (1) will provide the following capabilities:

(A) A magnetic field at the target of 1 Tesla.

(B) An energy flux at the target of 10 MW/m 2 .

(C) The ability to expose previously irradiated plasma facing material samples to plasma.

(3) Start of operations

The Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, ensure that the start of full operations of the facility described in paragraph (1) occurs before December 31, 2027 .

(4) Funding

Of the funds authorized to be appropriated for Fusion Energy Sciences, there are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences to complete construction of the facility described in paragraph (1)

(A) $21,895,000 for fiscal year 2023; and

(B) $3,800,000 for fiscal year 2024.
