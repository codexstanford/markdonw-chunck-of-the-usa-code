#### § 256e. Program of payments to children’s hospitals that operate graduate medical education programs
##### (c) Amount of payment for direct graduate medical education

(1) In general

The amount determined under this subsection for payments to a children’s hospital for direct graduate expenses relating to approved graduate medical residency training programs for a fiscal year is equal to the product of

(A) the updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education, as determined under paragraph (2); and

(B) the average number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospital’s graduate approved medical residency training programs (as determined under section 1395ww(h)(4) of this title during the fiscal year.

(2) Updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education

The updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education for a hospital for a fiscal year is an amount determined as follows:

(A) Determination of hospital single per resident amount

The Secretary shall compute for each hospital operating an approved graduate medical education program (regardless of whether or not it is a children’s hospital) a single per resident amount equal to the average (weighted by number of full-time equivalent residents) of the primary care per resident amount and the non-primary care per resident amount computed under section 1395ww(h)(2) of this title for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1997.

(B) Determination of wage and non-wage-related proportion of the single per resident amount

The Secretary shall estimate the average proportion of the single per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (A) that is attributable to wages and wage-related costs.

(C) Standardizing per resident amounts

The Secretary shall establish a standardized per resident amount for each such hospital

(i) by dividing the single per resident amount computed under subparagraph (A) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);

(ii) by dividing the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title for discharges occurring during fiscal year 1999 for the hospital’s area; and

(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).

(D) Determination of national average

The Secretary shall compute a national average per resident amount equal to the average of the standardized per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (C) for such hospitals, with the amount for each hospital weighted by the average number of full-time equivalent residents at such hospital.

(E) Application to individual hospitals

The Secretary shall compute for each such hospital that is a children’s hospital a per resident amount

(i) by dividing the national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (D) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);

(ii) by multiplying the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title for discharges occurring during the preceding fiscal year for the hospital’s area; and

(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).

(F) Updating rate

The Secretary shall update such per resident amount for each such children’s hospital by the estimated percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the period beginning October 1997 and ending with the midpoint of the Federal fiscal year for which payments are made.
