##### (b) Reports to Congress

(1) Commission report on necessary regulatory updates

Not later than 12 months after December 27, 2020 , the Commission shall submit to Congress a report that includes

(A) identification of updates to regulations, certifications, and other regulatory policies that the Commission determines are necessary in order for HA–LEU to be commercially available, including

(i) guidance for material control and accountability of special nuclear material;

(ii) certifications relating to transportation packaging for HA–LEU; and

(iii) licensing of enrichment, conversion, and fuel fabrication facilities for HA–LEU, and associated physical security plans for such facilities;

(B) a description of such updates; and

(C) a timeline to complete such updates.

(2) DOE report on program to support the availability of HA–LEU for civilian domestic demonstration and commercial use

(A) In general

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes actions proposed to be carried out by the Secretary under the program described in subsection (a)(1).

(B) Coordination and stakeholder input

In developing the report under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with

(i) the Commission;

(ii) suppliers of medical isotopes that have converted their operations to use HA–LEU;

(iii) the National Laboratories;

(iv) institutions of higher education;

(v) a diverse group of entities from the nuclear energy industry;

(vi) a diverse group of technology developers;

(vii) experts in nuclear nonproliferation, environmental safety, safeguards and security, and public health and safety; and

(viii) members of the consortium created under subsection (a)(2)(F).

(C) Cost and schedule estimates

The report under this paragraph shall include estimated costs, budgets, and timeframes for all activities carried out under this section.

(D) Required evaluations

The report under this paragraph shall evaluate

(i) the actions required to establish and carry out the program under subsection (a)(1) and the cost of such actions, including with respect to

(I) proposed preliminary terms for contracting between the Department and recipients of HA–LEU under the program (including guidelines defining the roles and responsibilities between the Department and the recipient); and

(II) the potential to coordinate with recipients of HA–LEU under the program regarding

(aa) fuel fabrication; and

(bb) fuel transport;

(ii) the potential sources and fuel forms available to provide uranium for the program under subsection (a)(1);

(iii) options to coordinate the program under subsection (a)(1) with the operation of the versatile, reactor-based fast neutron source under section 16279a of this title (as added by section 2003);

(iv) the ability of uranium producers to provide materials for advanced nuclear reactor fuel;

(v) any associated legal, regulatory, and policy issues that should be addressed to enable

(I) implementation of the program under subsection (a)(1); and

(II) the establishment of an industry capable of providing HA–LEU; and

(vi) any research and development plans to develop criticality benchmark data under subsection (a)(2)(A), if needed.

(3) Alternate fuels report

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020 , the Secretary shall, after consulting with relevant entities, including National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and technology developers, submit to Congress a report identifying any and all options for providing nuclear material, containing isotopes other than the uranium-235 isotope, such as uranium-233 and thorium-232 to be used as fuel for advanced nuclear reactor research, development, demonstration, or commercial application purposes.
