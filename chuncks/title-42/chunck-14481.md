### CHAPTER 77— ENERGY CONSERVATION
#### § 6295. Energy conservation standards
##### (t) Small manufacturer exemption

(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, exempt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.

(2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.
