### CHAPTER 16— NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
#### § 1862s–5. Programs to expand STEM opportunities
##### (f) Support for broadening participation in undergraduate STEM education

(1) In general

The Director of the Foundation shall make awards to institutions of higher education (or a consortium of such institutions) to implement or expand research-based reforms in undergraduate STEM education for the purpose of recruiting and retaining students from minority groups who are underrepresented in STEM fields.

(2) Merit review; competition

Awards shall be made under this subsection on a merit-reviewed, competitive basis.

(3) Use of funds

Activities supported by awards under this subsection may include

(A) implementation or expansion of innovative, research-based approaches to broaden participation of underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields;

(B) implementation or expansion of successful, research-based bridge, cohort, tutoring, or mentoring programs, including those involving community colleges and technical schools, designed to enhance the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields;

(C) implementation or expansion of outreach programs linking institutions of higher education and PreK–12 school systems in order to heighten awareness among precollege students from underrepresented minority groups of opportunities in college-level STEM fields and STEM careers;

(D) implementation or expansion of faculty development programs focused on improving retention of undergraduate STEM students from underrepresented minority groups;

(E) implementation or expansion of mechanisms designed to recognize and reward faculty members who demonstrate a commitment to increasing the participation of students from underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields;

(F) expansion of successful reforms aimed at increasing the number of STEM students from underrepresented minority groups beyond a single course or group of courses to achieve reform within an entire academic unit, or expansion of successful reform efforts beyond a single academic unit or field to other STEM academic units or fields within an institution of higher education;

(G) expansion of opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups to conduct STEM research in industry, at Federal labs, and at international research institutions or research sites;

(H) provision of stipends for students from underrepresented minority groups participating in research;

(I) development of research collaborations between research-intensive universities and primarily undergraduate historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority serving institutions;

(J) support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from underrepresented minority groups to participate in instructional or assessment activities at primarily undergraduate institutions, including primarily undergraduate historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority serving institutions and 2-year institutions of higher education; and

(K) other activities consistent with paragraph (1), as determined by the Director of the Foundation.

(4) Selection process

(A) Application

An institution of higher education (or a consortium thereof) seeking an award under this subsection shall submit an application to the Director of the Foundation at such time, in such manner, and containing such information and assurances as such Director may require. The application shall include, at a minimum

(i) a description of the proposed reform effort;

(ii) a description of the research findings that will serve as the basis for the proposed reform effort or, in the case of applications that propose an expansion of a previously implemented reform, a description of the previously implemented reform effort, including data about the recruitment, retention, and academic achievement of students from underrepresented minority groups;

(iii) evidence of an institutional commitment to, and support for, the proposed reform effort, including a long-term commitment to implement successful strategies from the current reform beyond the academic unit or units included in the award proposal;

(iv) a description of how the proposed reform effort may contribute to, or in the case of applications that propose an expansion of a previously implemented reforms has contributed to, change in institutional culture and policy such that a greater value is placed on the recruitment, retention and academic achievement of students from underrepresented minority groups;

(v) a description of existing or planned institutional policies and practices regarding faculty hiring, promotion, tenure, and teaching assignment that reward faculty contributions to improving the education of students from underrepresented minority groups in STEM; and

(vi) how the success and effectiveness of the proposed reform effort will be evaluated and assessed in order to contribute to the national knowledge base about models for catalyzing institutional change,  1

(B) Award distribution

The Director of the Foundation shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that awards under this subsection are made to a variety of types of institutions of higher education, including historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, minority serving institutions, and 2-year institutions of higher education.

(5) Education research

(A) In general

All awards made under this subsection shall include an education research component that will support the design and implementation of a system for data collection and evaluation of proposed reform efforts in order to build the knowledge base on promising models for increasing recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented minority groups in STEM education at the undergraduate level across a diverse set of institutions.

(B) Dissemination

The Director of the Foundation shall coordinate with the Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and Technology Council in disseminating the results of the research under this paragraph to ensure that best practices in broadening participation in STEM education at the undergraduate level are made readily available to all institutions of higher education, other Federal agencies that support STEM programs, non-Federal funders of STEM education, and the general public.

(6) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027.
