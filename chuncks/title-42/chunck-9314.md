#### § 1472. Loans for housing and buildings on adequate farms
##### (e) Manufactured homes; qualifications for loans made or insured; energy conservation requirements

(1) A loan which may be made or insured under this section with respect to housing shall be made or insured with respect to a manufactured home or with respect to a manufactured home and lot, whether such home or such home and lot is real property, personal property, or mixed real and personal property, if

(A) the manufactured home meets the standards prescribed pursuant to title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [ 42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.];

(B) the manufactured home, or the manufactured home and lot, meets the installation, structural, and site requirements which would apply under title II of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; and

(C) the manufactured home meets the energy conserving requirements established under paragraph (2), or until the energy conserving requirements are established under paragraph (2), the manufactured home meets the energy conserving requirements applicable to housing other than manufactured housing financed under this subchapter.

(2) Energy conserving requirements established by the Secretary for the purpose of paragraph (1)(C) shall

(A) reduce the operating costs for a borrower by maximizing the energy savings and be cost-effective over the life of the manufactured home or the term of the loan, whichever is shorter, taking into account variations in climate, types of energy used, the cost to modify the home to meet such requirements, and the estimated value of the energy saved over the term of the mortgage; and

(B) be established so that the increase in the annual loan payment resulting from the added energy conserving requirements in excess of those required by the standards prescribed under title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [ 42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.] shall not exceed the projected savings in annual energy costs.

(3) A loan that may be made or insured under this section with respect to a manufactured home on a permanent foundation, or a manufactured home on a permanent foundation and a lot, shall be repayable over the same period as would be applicable under section 203(b) of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1709(b) ].
