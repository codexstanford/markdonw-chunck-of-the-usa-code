#### § 19014. Expanding geographic and institutional diversity in research
##### (a) Continuing support for EPSCoR

(1) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(A) because maintaining the Nation’s scientific and economic leadership requires the participation of talented individuals nationwide, EPSCoR investments into State research and education capacities are in the Federal interest and should be sustained;

(B) EPSCoR should maintain its experimental component by supporting innovative methods for improving research capacity and competitiveness; and

(C) the Director should carry out this subsection while maintaining or increasing proposal success rates at emerging research institutions throughout the United States and without precluding access to awards for such institutions.

(2) Omitted

(3) Geographic diversity and inclusion

(A) In general

To the maximum extent practicable, not less than

(i) 15.5 percent in fiscal year 2023,

(vi) 19 percent in fiscal year 2028, and

(vii) 20 percent in fiscal year 2029, of the amounts appropriated to the Foundation for research and related activities, and science, mathematics, and engineering education and human resources programs and activities, excluding those amounts made available for polar research and operations support (and operations and maintenance of research facilities), shall be awarded to EPSCoR institutions.

(B) Scholarships

To the maximum extent practicable, not less than

(i) 16 percent in fiscal year 2023,

(ii) 18 percent in fiscal year 2024, and

(C) Considerations

The Director shall consider prioritizing funding and activities that enable sustainable growth in the competitiveness of EPSCoR jurisdictions, including

(i) infrastructure investments to build research capacity in EPSCoR jurisdictions;

(ii) scholarships, fellowships, and traineeships within new and existing programs, to promote the development of sustainable research and academic personnel;

(iii) partnerships between eligible organizations in EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR jurisdictions, to develop administrative, grant management, and proposal writing capabilities in EPSCoR jurisdictions;

(iv) capacity building activities for emerging research institutions, historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority serving institutions, consistent with this section and section 19183 of this title ; and

(v) leveraging the Partnerships for Innovation program, as well as the Foundation coordination role in the Department of Commerce technology and innovation hub program under section 3722a of title 15 as added by section 10621, to build sustainable innovation ecosystems in EPSCoR jurisdictions.

(D) Merit review

The Director shall achieve the percentages specified in this paragraph to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the National Science Foundation merit review process.

(ii) progress in building research capacity, including both infrastructure and personnel, in EPSCoR jurisdictions, including at historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, minority-serving institutions, and emerging research institutions; and

(iii) if the Foundation does not meet the requirement described in subparagraph (A), an explanation relating thereto and a plan for compliance in the following fiscal year and remediation.

(G) Analysis and sustainability report

Not later than December 31, 2026 , the Director shall submit to Congress a report containing an analysis of the impacts of the requirements under subparagraphs (A) and (B). The report shall include

(i) an analysis of how the requirements under this paragraph affected the balance of total funding awarded by the Foundation to states and territories across the United States;

(ii) an analysis of any changes in award success and total funding awarded to Historically black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, minority-serving institutions, and emerging research institutions between August 9, 2022 , and December 31, 2026 ;

(iii) an analysis of the gains in academic research capacity, quality, and competitiveness and in science and technology human resource development in EPSCoR jurisdictions made between August 9, 2022 , and December 31, 2026 ;

(iv) an assessment of EPSCoR eligibility criteria and determination on whether new eligibility criteria should be developed based on the findings from clauses (i), (ii), and (iii); and

(v) a plan to sustain and grow improvements in research capacity and competitiveness in EPSCoR jurisdictions.

(H) EPSCoR eligibility

(i) In general

The Director shall ensure eligibility for current EPSCoR jurisdictions for five years from August 9, 2022 , after which the Director shall determine whether new eligibility criteria should be developed based on the findings in the report required under subparagraph (G).
