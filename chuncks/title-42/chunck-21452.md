### CHAPTER 149— NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY AND PROGRAMS
#### § 15962. Project criteria
##### (b) Technical criteria for clean coal power initiative

(1) Gasification projects

(A) In general

In allocating the funds made available under section 15961(a) of this title , the Secretary shall ensure that at least 70 percent of the funds are used only to fund projects on coal-based gasification technologies, including

(i) gasification combined cycle;

(ii) gasification fuel cells and turbine combined cycle;

(iii) gasification coproduction;

(iv) hybrid gasification and combustion; and

(v) other advanced coal based technologies capable of producing a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide.

(B) Technical milestones

(i) Periodic determination

(I) In general

The Secretary shall periodically set technical milestones specifying the emission and thermal efficiency levels that coal gasification projects under this part shall be designed, and reasonably expected, to achieve.

(II) Prescriptive milestones

The technical milestones shall become more prescriptive during the period of the clean coal power initiative.

(ii) 2020 goals

The Secretary shall establish the periodic milestones so as to achieve by the year 2020 coal gasification projects able

(I)

(aa) to remove at least 99 percent of sulfur dioxide; or

(bb) to emit not more than 0.04 pound SO 2 per million Btu, based on a 30-day average;

(II) to emit not more than .05 lbs of NO x per million Btu;

(III) to achieve at least 95 percent reductions in mercury emissions; and

(IV) to achieve a thermal efficiency of at least

(aa) 50 percent for coal of more than 9,000 Btu;

(bb) 48 percent for coal of 7,000 to 9,000 Btu; and

(cc) 46 percent for coal of less than 7,000 Btu.

(2) Other projects

(A) Allocation of funds

The Secretary shall ensure that up to 30 percent of the funds made available under section 15961(a) of this title are used to fund projects other than those described in paragraph (1).

(B) Technical milestones

(i) Periodic determination

(I) In general

The Secretary shall periodically establish technical milestones specifying the emission and thermal efficiency levels that projects funded under this paragraph shall be designed, and reasonably expected, to achieve.

(II) Prescriptive milestones

The technical milestones shall become more prescriptive during the period of the clean coal power initiative.

(ii) 2020 goals

The Secretary shall set the periodic milestones so as to achieve by the year 2020 projects able

(I) to remove at least 97 percent of sulfur dioxide;

(II) to emit no more than .08 lbs of NO x per million Btu;

(III) to achieve at least 90 percent reductions in mercury emissions; and

(IV) to achieve a thermal efficiency of at least

(aa) 43 percent for coal of more than 9,000 Btu;

(bb) 41 percent for coal of 7,000 to 9,000 Btu; and

(cc) 39 percent for coal of less than 7,000 Btu.

(3) Consultation

Before setting the technical milestones under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B), the Secretary shall consult with

(A) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; and

(B) interested entities, including

(i) coal producers;

(ii) industries using coal;

(iii) organizations that promote coal or advanced coal technologies;

(iv) environmental organizations;

(v) organizations representing workers; and

(vi) organizations representing consumers.

(4) Existing units

In the case of projects at units in existence on August 8, 2005 , in lieu of the thermal efficiency requirements described in paragraphs (1)(B)(ii)(IV) and (2)(B)(ii)(IV), the milestones shall be designed to achieve an overall thermal design efficiency improvement, compared to the efficiency of the unit as operated, of not less than

(A) 7 percent for coal of more than 9,000 Btu;

(B) 6 percent for coal of 7,000 to 9,000 Btu; or

(C) 4 percent for coal of less than 7,000 Btu.

(5) Administration

(A) Elevation of site

In evaluating project proposals to achieve thermal efficiency levels established under paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (2)(B)(i) and in determining progress towards thermal efficiency milestones under paragraphs (1)(B)(ii)(IV), (2)(B)(ii)(IV), and (4), the Secretary shall take into account and make adjustments for the elevation of the site at which a project is proposed to be constructed.

(B) Applicability of milestones

In applying the thermal efficiency milestones under paragraphs (1)(B)(ii)(IV), (2)(B)(ii)(IV), and (4) to projects that separate and capture at least 50 percent of the potential emissions of carbon dioxide by a facility, the energy used for separation and capture of carbon dioxide shall not be counted in calculating the thermal efficiency.

(C) Permitted uses

In carrying out this section, the Secretary may give priority to projects that include, as part of the project

(i) the separation or capture of carbon dioxide; or

(ii) the reduction of the demand for natural gas if deployed.
