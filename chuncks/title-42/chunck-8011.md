##### (i) Commencement of certification program

(1) No medicare supplemental policy shall be certified and no such policy may be issued bearing the emblem authorized by the Secretary under subsection (a) until July 1, 1982 . On and after such date policies certified by the Secretary may bear such emblem, including policies which were issued prior to such date and were subsequently certified, and insurers may notify holders of such certified policies issued prior to such date using such emblem in the notification.

(2)

(A) The Secretary shall not implement the certification program established under subsection (a) with respect to policies issued in a State unless the Panel makes a finding that such State cannot be expected to have established, by July 1, 1982 , an approved State regulatory program meeting the standards and requirements of subsection (b)(1). If the Panel makes such a finding, the Secretary shall implement such program under subsection (a) with respect to medicare supplemental policies issued in such State, until such time as the Panel determines that such State has a program that meets the standards and requirements of subsection (b)(1).

(B) Any finding by the Panel under subparagraph (A) shall be transmitted in writing, not later than January 1, 1982 , to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and shall not become effective until 60 days after the date of its transmittal to the Committees of the Congress under this subparagraph. In counting such days, days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment sine die or an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in the computation.
