### CHAPTER 8— LOW-INCOME HOUSING
#### § 1437aaa–3. Homeownership program requirements
##### (d) Acquisition and rehabilitation limitations

Acquisition or rehabilitation of public housing projects under a homeownership program under this subchapter may not consist of acquisition or rehabilitation of less than the whole public housing project in a project consisting of more than 1 building. The provisions of this subsection may be waived upon a finding by the Secretary that the sale of less than all the buildings in a project is feasible and will not result in a hardship to any tenants of the project who are not included in the homeownership program.
