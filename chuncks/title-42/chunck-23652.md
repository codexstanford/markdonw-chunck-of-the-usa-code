#### § 18997. Microelectronics workforce development activities
##### (a) Creating helpful initiatives to produce personnel in needed growth industries

(1) In general

The Director shall make awards to institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, or consortia thereof, for research, development, and related activities to advance innovative approaches to developing, improving, and expanding evidence-based education and workforce development activities and learning experiences at all levels of education in fields and disciplines related to microelectronics.

(2) Purposes

Activities carried out under this section shall be for the purpose of supporting the growth, retention, and development of a diverse and sustainable microelectronics workforce to meet the requirements of the programs established in section 4656(c)(2)(C) of title 15 in support of the evolving needs of industry, academia, government, and Federal laboratories.

(3) Uses of funds

Awards made under this section shall be used to support activities, such as

(A) development of industry-oriented curricula and teaching modules for topics relevant to microelectronics, including those that provide meaningful hands-on learning experiences;

(B) dissemination of materials developed in subparagraph (A), including through the creation and maintenance of a publicly-accessible database and online portal;

(C) development and implementation of training, research, and professional development programs for teachers, including innovative pre-service and in-service programs, in microelectronics and related fields;

(D) support for learning activities and experiences that provide physical, simulated, or remote access to training facilities and industry-standard processes and tools, including equipment and software for the design, development, manufacturing, and testing of microelectronics;

(E) increasing the integration of microelectronics content into STEM curricula at all education levels;

(F) Growing  1 academic research capacity in microelectronics by incentivizing the hiring of faculty in fields critical to microelectronics;

(G) support for innovative industry pathway programs that connect high school, vocational, military, college, and graduate programs; and

(H) providing informal hands-on microelectronics learning opportunities for PreK-12 students in different learning environments, including competitions.

(4) Advanced microelectronics traineeships

(A) In general

The Director shall make awards to institutions of higher education or nonprofit organizations (or consortia of such institutions and organizations) to establish traineeship programs for graduate students who pursue microelectronics research leading to a masters or doctorate degree by providing funding and other assistance, and by providing graduate students with opportunities for research experiences in government or industry related to the students’ microelectronics studies.

(B) Use of funds

Institutions of higher education or non-profit organizations (or consortia of such institutions and organizations) shall use award funds provided under subparagraph (A) for the purposes of

(i) paying tuition and fees, and providing stipends, for students receiving traineeships who are citizens, nationals, or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence;

(ii) facilitating opportunities for scientific internship programs for students receiving traineeships in microelectronics at private industry, nonprofit research institutions, or Federal laboratories; and

(iii) such other costs associated with the administration of the program.

(5) Microelectronics skilled technical workforce programs

The Director shall make awards under the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 ( 42 U.S.C. 1862h -j) to support programs for skilled technical workers in STEM disciplines that are aligned with skilled workforce needs of the microelectronics industry and lead to an associate’s degree, or equivalent certification, by providing funding and other assistance, including opportunities for internships and other hands-on experiences in industry related to the students’ microelectronics studies.

(6) Microelectronics research experiences through existing programs

The Director shall seek to increase opportunities for microelectronics research for students and trainees at all levels by encouraging proposals in microelectronics through existing programs including

(A) research experiences for undergraduates pursuant to section 1862p–6 of this title ;

(B) postdoctoral fellowship programs established pursuant to section 1862p–11 of this title ;

(C) graduate fellowships established pursuant to section 1869 of this title ;

(D) informal STEM education programs established pursuant to section 1862q of this title ;

(E) the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program established pursuant to section 1862n–1 of this title ;

(F) major research instrumentation programs established pursuant to section 1862 o –14 of this title; and

(G) low-income  2 scholarship program established pursuant to section 1869c of this title .

(7) Industry partnerships

In carrying out the activities under this section, the Director shall encourage awardees to partner with industry and other private sector organizations to facilitate the expansion of workforce pipelines and enable access to industry-standard equipment and software for use in undergraduate and graduate microelectronics education programs.

(8) Interagency coordination

In carrying out activities under this section, the Director shall collaborate with the Subcommittee on Microelectronics Leadership of the National Science and Technology Council, established in subsection (a) of section 4656 of title 15 and the National Semiconductor Technology Center established in subsection (c) of section 4656 of title 15 , and other relevant Federal agencies to maintain the effectiveness of microelectronics workforce development activities across the agencies.
