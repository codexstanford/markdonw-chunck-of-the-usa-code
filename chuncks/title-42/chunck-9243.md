(1) Review

The Secretary shall review each application for participation in the demonstration program under this subchapter and shall determine and notify the jurisdiction submitting the application, not later than 90 days after its submission, of whether the application is approvable under this subchapter. If the Secretary determines that the application of a jurisdiction is approvable under this subchapter, the Secretary shall provide affected public housing agencies an opportunity to review and to provide written comments on the application for a period of not less than 30 days after notification under the preceding sentence. If the Secretary determines that an application is not approvable under this subchapter, the Secretary shall notify the jurisdiction submitting the application of the reasons for such determination. Upon making a determination of whether an application is approvable or nonapprovable under this subchapter, the Secretary shall make such determination publicly available in writing together with a written statement of the reasons for such determination.

(2) Approval

The Secretary may approve jurisdictions for participation in the demonstration program under this subchapter, but only from among applications that the Secretary has determined under paragraph  2 are approvable under this subchapter and only in accordance with section 1437bbb–1(c) of this title . The Secretary shall base the selection of jurisdictions to approve on the potential success, as evidenced by the application, in

(A) achieving the goals set forth in the performance standards under paragraph (4)(A); and

(B) increasing housing choices for low-income families.

(3) Agreement

The Secretary shall offer to enter into an agreement with each jurisdiction approved for participation in the program under this subchapter providing for assistance pursuant to this subchapter for a period in accordance with section 1437bbb–1(b) of this title and incorporating a requirement that the jurisdiction achieve a particular level of performance in each of the areas for which performance standards are established under paragraph (4)(A) of this subsection. If the Secretary and the jurisdiction enter into an agreement, the Secretary shall provide any covered housing assistance for the jurisdiction in the manner authorized under this subchapter. The Secretary may not provide covered housing assistance for a jurisdiction in the manner authorized under this subchapter unless the Secretary and jurisdiction enter into an agreement under this paragraph.

(4) Performance standards

(A) Establishment

The Secretary and each participating jurisdiction may collectively establish standards for evaluating the performance of the participating jurisdiction in meeting the purposes under section 1437bbb of this title , which may include standards for

(i) moving dependent low-income families to economic self-sufficiency;

(ii) reducing the per-family cost of providing housing assistance;

(iii) expanding the stock of affordable housing and housing choices for low-income families;

(iv) improving program management;

(v) increasing the number of homeownership opportunities for low-income families;

(vi) reducing homelessness through providing permanent housing resources;

(vii) reducing geographic concentration of assisted families; and

(viii) any other performance goals that the Secretary and the participating jurisdiction may establish.

(B) Failure to comply

If, at any time during the participation of a jurisdiction in the program under this subchapter, the Secretary determines that the jurisdiction is not sufficiently meeting, or making progress toward meeting, the levels of performance incorporated into the agreement of the jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall terminate the participation of the jurisdiction in the program under this subchapter and require the implementation of the procedures included in the application of the jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a)(10).

(5) Troubled agencies

The Secretary may establish requirements for the approval of applications under this section submitted by public housing agencies designated under section 1437d(j)(2) of this title as troubled, which may include additional or different criteria determined by the Secretary to be more appropriate for such agencies.
