(B)

(i) Subject to clause (ii), the space is benchmarked under a nationally recognized, online, free benchmarking program, with public disclosure, unless the space is a space for which owners cannot access whole building utility consumption data, including spaces

(I) that are located in States with privacy laws that provide that utilities shall not provide such aggregated information to multitenant building owners; and

(II) for which tenants do not provide energy consumption information to the commercial building owner in response to a request from the building owner.

(ii) A Federal agency that is a tenant of the space shall provide to the building owner, or authorize the owner to obtain from the utility, the energy consumption information of the space for the benchmarking and disclosure required by this subparagraph.
