#### § 1395e. Deductibles and coinsurance
##### (b) Inpatient hospital deductible; application

(1) The inpatient hospital deductible for 1987 shall be $520. The inpatient hospital deductible for any succeeding year shall be an amount equal to the inpatient hospital deductible for the preceding calendar year, changed by the Secretary’s best estimate of the payment-weighted average of the applicable percentage increases (as defined in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B) of this title ) which are applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(A) of this title for discharges in the fiscal year that begins on October 1 of such preceding calendar year, and adjusted to reflect changes in real case mix (determined on the basis of the most recent case mix data available). Any amount determined under the preceding sentence which is not a multiple of $4 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $4 (or, if it is midway between two multiples of $4, to the next higher multiple of $4).

(2) The Secretary shall promulgate the inpatient hospital deductible and all coinsurance amounts under this section between September 1 and September 15 of the year preceding the year to which they will apply.

(3) The inpatient hospital deductible for a year shall apply to

(A) the deduction under the first sentence of subsection (a)(1) for the year in which the first day of inpatient hospital services or inpatient critical access hospital services occurs in a spell of illness, and

(B) to the coinsurance amounts under subsection (a) for inpatient hospital services, inpatient critical access hospital services and post-hospital extended care services furnished in that year.
