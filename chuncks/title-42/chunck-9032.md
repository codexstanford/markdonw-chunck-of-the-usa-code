### CHAPTER 8— LOW-INCOME HOUSING
#### § 1437g. Public housing Capital and Operating Funds
##### (e) Operating Fund

(1) In general

The Secretary shall establish an Operating Fund for the purpose of making assistance available to public housing agencies for the operation and management of public housing, including

(A) procedures and systems to maintain and ensure the efficient management and operation of public housing units (including amounts sufficient to pay for the reasonable costs of review by an independent auditor of the documentation or other information maintained pursuant to section 1437d(j)(6) of this title by a public housing agency or resident management corporation to substantiate the performance of that agency or corporation);

(B) activities to ensure a program of routine preventative maintenance;

(C) anticrime and antidrug activities, including the costs of providing adequate security for public housing residents, including above-baseline police service agreements;

(D) activities related to the provision of services, including service coordinators for elderly persons or persons with disabilities;

(E) activities to provide for management and participation in the management and policymaking of public housing by public housing residents;

(F) the costs of insurance;

(G) the energy costs associated with public housing units, with an emphasis on energy conservation;

(H) the costs of administering a public housing work program under section 1437j of this title , including the costs of any related insurance needs;

(I) the costs of repaying, together with rent contributions, debt incurred to finance the rehabilitation and development of public housing units, which shall be subject to such reasonable requirements as the Secretary may establish;

(J) the costs associated with the operation and management of mixed finance projects, to the extent appropriate; and

(K) the costs of operating computer centers in public housing through a Neighborhood Networks initiative described in subsection (d)(1)(E), and of activities related to that initiative.

(2) Formula

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish a formula for determining the amount of assistance provided to public housing agencies from the Operating Fund for a fiscal year. The formula may take into account

(i) standards for the costs of operating and reasonable projections of income, taking into account the characteristics and locations of the public housing projects and characteristics of the families served and to be served (including the incomes of the families), or the costs of providing comparable services as determined in accordance with criteria or a formula representing the operations of a prototype well-managed public housing project;

(ii) the number of public housing dwelling units owned, assisted, or operated by the public housing agency;

(iii) the number of public housing dwelling units owned, assisted, or operated by the public housing agency that are chronically vacant and the amount of assistance appropriate for those units;

(iv) to the extent quantifiable, the extent to which the public housing agency provides programs and activities designed to promote the economic self-sufficiency and management skills of public housing residents;

(v) the need of the public housing agency to carry out anti-crime and anti-drug activities, including providing adequate security for public housing residents;

(vi) the amount of public housing rental income foregone by the public housing agency as a result of escrow savings accounts under section 1437u(d)(2) of this title for families participating in a family self-sufficiency program of the agency under such section 1437u of this title ; and

(vii) any other factors that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(B) Incentive to increase certain rental income

The formula shall provide an incentive to encourage public housing agencies to facilitate increases in earned income by families in occupancy. Any such incentive shall provide that the agency shall benefit from increases in such rental income and that such amounts accruing to the agency pursuant to such benefit may be used only for low-income housing or to benefit the residents of the public housing agency.

(C) Treatment of savings

(i) In general

The treatment of utility and waste management costs under the formula shall provide that a public housing agency shall receive the full financial benefit from any reduction in the cost of utilities or waste management resulting from any contract with a third party to undertake energy conservation improvements in one or more of its public housing projects.

(ii) Third party contracts

Contracts described in clause (i) may include contracts for equipment conversions to less costly utility sources, projects with resident-paid utilities, and adjustments to frozen base year consumption, including systems repaired to meet applicable building and safety codes and adjustments for occupancy rates increased by rehabilitation.

(iii) Term of contract

The total term of a contract described in clause (i) shall not exceed 20 years to allow longer payback periods for retrofits, including windows, heating system replacements, wall insulation, site-based generation, advanced energy savings technologies, including renewable energy generation, and other such retrofits.

(iv) Existing contracts

The term of a contract described in clause (i) that, as of December 26, 2007 , is in repayment and has a term of not more than 12 years, may be extended to a term of not more than 20 years to permit additional energy conservation improvements without requiring the reprocurement of energy performance contractors.

(D) Freeze of consumption levels

(i) In general

A small public housing agency, as defined in section 1437z–10(a) of this title , may elect to be paid for its utility and waste management costs under the formula for a period, at the discretion of the small public housing agency, of not more than 20 years based on the small public housing agency’s average annual consumption during the 3-year period preceding the year in which the election is made (in this subparagraph referred to as the “consumption base level”).

(ii) Initial adjustment in consumption base level

The Secretary shall make an initial one-time adjustment in the consumption base level to account for differences in the heating degree day average over the most recent 20-year period compared to the average in the consumption base level.

(iii) Adjustments in consumption base level

The Secretary shall make adjustments in the consumption base level to account for an increase or reduction in units, a change in fuel source, a change in resident controlled electricity consumption, or for other reasons.

(iv) Savings

All cost savings resulting from an election made by a small public housing agency under this subparagraph

(I) shall accrue to the small public housing agency; and

(II) may be used for any public housing purpose at the discretion of the small public housing agency.

(v) Third parties

A small public housing agency making an election under this subparagraph

(I) may use, but shall not be required to use, the services of a third party in its energy conservation program; and

(II) shall have the sole discretion to determine the source, and terms and conditions, of any financing used for its energy conservation program.

(3) Condition on use

No portion of any public housing project operated using amounts provided under this subsection, or under this section as in effect before the effective date under section 503(a) of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, may be disposed of before the expiration of the 10-year period beginning upon the conclusion of the fiscal year for which such amounts were provided, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
