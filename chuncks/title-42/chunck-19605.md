### CHAPTER 129— NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE
#### § 12571. Authority to provide assistance and approved national service positions
##### (e) Matching funds requirements

(1) Requirements

Except as provided in section 12594 of this title , the Corporation share of the cost (including the costs of member living allowances, employment-related taxes, health care coverage, and workers’ compensation and other necessary operation costs) of carrying out a national service program that receives the assistance under subsection (a), whether the assistance is provided directly or as a subgrant from the original recipient of the assistance, may not exceed 75 percent of such cost.

(2) Calculation

In providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out a national service program, the program

(A) shall provide for such share through a payment in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including facilities, equipment, or services; and

(B) may provide for such share through State sources, local sources, or other Federal sources (other than the use of funds made available under the national service laws).

(3) Cost of health care

In providing a payment in cash under paragraph (2)(A) as part of providing for the remaining share of the cost of carrying out a national service program, the program may count not more than 85 percent of the cost of providing a health care policy described in section 12594(d)(2) of this title toward such share.

(4) Waiver

The Corporation may waive in whole or in part the requirements of paragraph (1) with respect to a national service program in any fiscal year if the Corporation determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to a lack of available financial resources at the local level.

(5) Other Federal funds

(A) Recipient report

A recipient of assistance under this section (other than a recipient of assistance through a fixed-amount grant in accordance with section 12581( l ) of this title) shall report to the Corporation the amount and source of any Federal funds used to carry out the program for which the assistance is made available other than those provided by the Corporation.

(B) Corporation report

The Corporation shall report to the authorizing committees on an annual basis information regarding each recipient of such assistance that uses Federal funds other than those provided by the Corporation to carry out such a program, including the amounts and sources of the other Federal funds.
