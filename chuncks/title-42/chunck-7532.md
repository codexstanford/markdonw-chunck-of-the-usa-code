### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–24. Premiums and bid amounts
##### (f) Requirement for additional benefits before 2006

(1) Requirement

(A) In general

For years before 2006, each Medicare+Choice organization (in relation to a Medicare+Choice plan, other than an MSA plan, it offers) shall provide that if there is an excess amount (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for the plan for a contract year, subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the organization shall provide to individuals such additional benefits (as the organization may specify) in a value which the Secretary determines is at least equal to the adjusted excess amount (as defined in subparagraph (C)).

(B) Excess amount

For purposes of this paragraph, the “excess amount”, for an organization for a plan, is the amount (if any) by which

(i) the average of the capitation payments made to the organization under section 1395w–23 of this title for the plan at the beginning of contract year, exceeds

(ii) the actuarial value of the required benefits described in section 1395w–22(a)(1)(A) of this title under the plan for individuals under this part, as determined based upon an adjusted community rate described in paragraph (3) (as reduced for the actuarial value of the coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles under parts A and B).

(C) Adjusted excess amount

For purposes of this paragraph, the “adjusted excess amount”, for an organization for a plan, is the excess amount reduced to reflect any amount withheld and reserved for the organization for the year under paragraph (2).

(D) Uniform application

This paragraph shall be applied uniformly for all enrollees for a plan.

(E) Premium reductions

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), as part of providing any additional benefits required under subparagraph (A), a Medicare+Choice organization may elect a reduction in its payments under section 1395w–23(a)(1)(A) of this title with respect to a Medicare+Choice plan and the Secretary shall apply such reduction to reduce the premium under section 1395r of this title of each enrollee in such plan as provided in section 1395s(i) of this title .

(ii) Amount of reduction

The amount of the reduction under clause (i) with respect to any enrollee in a Medicare+Choice plan

(I) may not exceed 125 percent of the premium described under section 1395r(a)(3) of this title ; and

(II) shall apply uniformly to each enrollee of the Medicare+Choice plan to which such reduction applies.

(F) Construction

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice organization from providing supplemental benefits (described in section 1395w–22(a)(3) of this title ) that are in addition to the health care benefits otherwise required to be provided under this paragraph and from imposing a premium for such supplemental benefits.

(2) Stabilization fund

A Medicare+Choice organization may provide that a part of the value of an excess amount described in paragraph (1) be withheld and reserved in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (in such proportions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate) by the Secretary for subsequent annual contract periods, to the extent required to stabilize and prevent undue fluctuations in the additional benefits offered in those subsequent periods by the organization in accordance with such paragraph. Any of such value of the amount reserved which is not provided as additional benefits described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals electing the Medicare+Choice plan of the organization in accordance with such paragraph prior to the end of such periods, shall revert for the use of such trust funds.

(3) Adjusted community rate

For purposes of this subsection, subject to paragraph (4), the term “adjusted community rate” for a service or services means, at the election of a Medicare+Choice organization, either

(A) the rate of payment for that service or services which the Secretary annually determines would apply to an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan under this part if the rate of payment were determined under a “community rating system” (as defined in section 300e–1(8) of this title , other than subparagraph (C)), or

(B) such portion of the weighted aggregate premium, which the Secretary annually estimates would apply to such an individual, as the Secretary annually estimates is attributable to that service or services, but adjusted for differences between the utilization characteristics of the individuals electing coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the other enrollees with the plan (or, if the Secretary finds that adequate data are not available to adjust for those differences, the differences between the utilization characteristics of individuals selecting other Medicare+Choice coverage, or Medicare+Choice eligible individuals in the area, in the State, or in the United States, eligible to elect Medicare+Choice coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the rest of the population in the area, in the State, or in the United States, respectively).

(4) Determination based on insufficient data

For purposes of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that there is insufficient enrollment experience to determine an average of the capitation payments to be made under this part at the beginning of a contract period or to determine (in the case of a newly operated provider-sponsored organization or other new organization) the adjusted community rate for the organization, the Secretary may determine such an average based on the enrollment experience of other contracts entered into under this part and may determine such a rate using data in the general commercial marketplace.
