#### § 6240. Petroleum products for storage, transport, or exchange
##### (c) Procedures

The Secretary shall develop, with public notice and opportunity for comment, procedures consistent with the objectives of this section to acquire petroleum for the Reserve. Such procedures shall take into account the need to

(1) maximize overall domestic supply of crude oil (including quantities stored in private sector inventories);

(2) avoid incurring excessive cost or appreciably affecting the price of petroleum products to consumers;

(3) minimize the costs to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy in acquiring such petroleum products (including foregone revenues to the Treasury when petroleum products for the Reserve are obtained through the royalty-in-kind program);

(4) protect national security;

(5) avoid adversely affecting current and futures prices, supplies, and inventories of oil; and

(6) address other factors that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
