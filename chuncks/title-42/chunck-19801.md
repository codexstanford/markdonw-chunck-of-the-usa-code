##### (j) Approval of State Commission or alternative

(1) Submission to Corporation

The chief executive officer for a State shall notify the Corporation of the establishment or designation of the State Commission or use of an alternative administrative entity for the State. The notification shall include a description of

(A) the composition and membership of the State Commission or alternative administrative entity; and

(B) the authority of the State Commission or alternative administrative entity regarding national service activities carried out by the State.

(2) Approval of alternative administrative entity

Any designation of a State Commission or use of an alternative administrative entity to carry out the duties of a State Commission shall be subject to the approval of the Corporation, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Corporation shall approve an alternative administrative entity if such entity provides for individuals described in paragraph (1), and some of the individuals described in paragraph (2), of subsection (c) to play a significant policymaking role in carrying out the duties otherwise entrusted to a State Commission, including the duties described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (e).

(3) Rejection

The Corporation may reject a State Commission if the Corporation determines that the composition, membership, or duties of the State Commission do not comply with the requirements of this section. The Corporation may reject a request to use an alternative administrative entity in lieu of a State Commission if the Corporation determines that the entity does not provide for the individuals described in paragraph (1), and some of the individuals described in paragraph (2), of subsection (c) to play a significant policymaking role as described in paragraph (2). If the Corporation rejects a State Commission or alternative administrative entity under this paragraph, the Corporation shall promptly notify the State of the reasons for the rejection.

(4) Resubmission and reconsideration

The Corporation shall provide a State notified under paragraph (3) with a reasonable opportunity to revise the rejected State Commission or alternative administrative entity. At the request of the State, the Corporation shall provide technical assistance to the State as part of the revision process. The Corporation shall promptly reconsider any resubmission of a notification under paragraph (1) or application to use an alternative administrative entity under paragraph (2).

(5) Subsequent changes

This subsection shall also apply to any change in the composition or duties of a State Commission or an alternative administrative entity made after approval of the State Commission or the alternative administrative entity.

(6) Rights

An alternative administrative entity approved by the Corporation under this subsection shall have the same rights as a State Commission.
