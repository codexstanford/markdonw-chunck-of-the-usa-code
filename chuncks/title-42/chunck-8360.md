### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1396b. Payment to States
##### (v) Medical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence

(1) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (4), no payment may be made to a State under this section for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law.

(2) Payment shall be made under this section for care and services that are furnished to an alien described in paragraph (1) only if

(A) such care and services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition of the alien,

(B) such alien otherwise meets the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the State plan approved under this subchapter (other than the requirement of the receipt of aid or assistance under subchapter IV, supplemental security income benefits under subchapter XVI, or a State supplementary payment), and

(C) such care and services are not related to an organ transplant procedure.

(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term “emergency medical condition” means a medical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in

(A) placing the patient’s health in serious jeopardy,

(B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or

(C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

(4)

(A) A State may elect (in a plan amendment under this subchapter) to provide medical assistance under this subchapter, notwithstanding sections 1611(a), 1612(b), 1613, and 1631 of title 8, to children and pregnant women who are lawfully residing in the United States (including battered individuals described in section 1641(c) of title 8 ) and who are otherwise eligible for such assistance, within either or both of the following eligibility categories:

(i) Pregnant women

Women during pregnancy (and during the 60-day period beginning on the last day of the pregnancy).

(ii) Children

Individuals under 21 years of age, including optional targeted low-income children described in section 1396d(u)(2)(B) of this title .

(B) In the case of a State that has elected to provide medical assistance to a category of aliens under subparagraph (A), no debt shall accrue under an affidavit of support against any sponsor of such an alien on the basis of provision of assistance to such category and the cost of such assistance shall not be considered as an unreimbursed cost.

(C) As part of the State’s ongoing eligibility redetermination requirements and procedures for an individual provided medical assistance as a result of an election by the State under subparagraph (A), a State shall verify that the individual continues to lawfully reside in the United States using the documentation presented to the State by the individual on initial enrollment. If the State cannot successfully verify that the individual is lawfully residing in the United States in this manner, it shall require that the individual provide the State with further documentation or other evidence to verify that the individual is lawfully residing in the United States.
