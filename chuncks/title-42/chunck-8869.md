#### § 1397dd. Allotments
##### (j) Additional allotments to eliminate funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2008

(1) Appropriation; allotment authority

For the purpose of providing additional allotments described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (3), there is appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be necessary, not to exceed $1,600,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.

(2) Shortfall States described

For purposes of paragraph (3), a shortfall State described in this paragraph is a State with a State child health plan approved under this subchapter for which the Secretary estimates, on the basis of the most recent data available to the Secretary as of November 30, 2007 , that the Federal share amount of the projected expenditures under such plan for such State for fiscal year 2008 will exceed the sum of

(A) the amount of the State’s allotments for each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that will not be expended by the end of fiscal year 2007;

(B) the amount, if any, that is to be redistributed to the State during fiscal year 2008 in accordance with subsection (i); and

(C) the amount of the State’s allotment for fiscal year 2008.

(3) Allotments

In addition to the allotments provided under subsections (b) and (c), subject to paragraph (4), of the amount available for the additional allotments under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2008, the Secretary shall allot

(A) to each shortfall State described in paragraph (2) not described in subparagraph (B), such amount as the Secretary determines will eliminate the estimated shortfall described in such paragraph for the State; and

(B) to each commonwealth or territory described in subsection (c)(3), an amount equal to the percentage specified in subsection (c)(2) for the commonwealth or territory multiplied by 1.05 percent of the sum of the amounts determined for each shortfall State under subparagraph (A).

(4) Proration rule

If the amounts available for additional allotments under paragraph (1) are less than the total of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (3), the amounts computed under such subparagraphs shall be reduced proportionally.

(5) Retrospective adjustment

The Secretary may adjust the estimates and determinations made to carry out this subsection as necessary on the basis of the amounts reported by States not later than November 30, 2008 , on CMS Form 64 or CMS Form 21, as the case may be, and as approved by the Secretary.

(6) One-year availability; no redistribution of unexpended additional allotments

Notwithstanding subsections (e) and (f), amounts allotted to a State pursuant to this subsection for fiscal year 2008, subject to paragraph (5), shall only remain available for expenditure by the State through September 30, 2008 . Any amounts of such allotments that remain unexpended as of such date shall not be subject to redistribution under subsection (f).
