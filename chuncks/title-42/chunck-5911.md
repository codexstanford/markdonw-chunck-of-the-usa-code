#### § 629b. State plans
##### (b) Approval of plans

(1) In general

The Secretary shall approve a plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a) only if the plan was developed jointly by the Secretary and the State, after consultation by the State agency with appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies and community-based organizations with experience in administering programs of services for children and families (including family preservation, family support, family reunification, and adoption promotion and support services).

(2) Plans of Indian tribes or tribal consortia

(A) Exemption from inappropriate requirements

The Secretary may exempt a plan submitted by an Indian tribe or tribal consortium from the requirements of subsection (a)(4) of this section to the extent that the Secretary determines those requirements would be inappropriate to apply to the Indian tribe or tribal consortium, taking into account the resources, needs, and other circumstances of the Indian tribe or tribal consortium.

(B) Special rule

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary may not approve a plan of an Indian tribe or tribal consortium under this subpart to which (but for this subparagraph) an allotment of less than $10,000 would be made under section 629c(a) of this title if allotments were made under section 629c(a) of this title to all Indian tribes and tribal consortia with plans approved under this subpart with the same or larger numbers of children.
