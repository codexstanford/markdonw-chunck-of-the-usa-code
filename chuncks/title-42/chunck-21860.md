#### § 16281. Advanced nuclear fuel availability
##### (a) Program

(1) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish and carry out, through the Office of Nuclear Energy, a program to support the availability of HA–LEU for civilian domestic research, development, demonstration, and commercial use.

(2) Program elements

In carrying out the program under paragraph (1), the Secretary

(A) shall develop, in consultation with the Commission, criticality benchmark data to assist the Commission in

(i) the licensing and regulation of special nuclear material fuel fabrication and enrichment facilities under part 70 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations; and

(ii) certification of transportation packages under part 71 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations;

(B) shall conduct research and development, and provide financial assistance to assist commercial entities, to design and license transportation packages for HA–LEU, including canisters for metal, gas, and other HA–LEU compositions;

(C) shall, to the extent practicable

(i) by January 1, 2024 , support commercial entity submission of such transportation package designs to the Commission for certification by the Commission under part 71 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations; and

(ii) encourage the Commission to have such transportation package designs so certified by the Commission within 24 months after receipt of an application;

(D) shall consider options for acquiring or providing HA–LEU from a stockpile of uranium owned by the Department, or using enrichment technology, to make available to members of the consortium established pursuant to subparagraph (F) for commercial use or demonstration projects, taking into account cost and amount of time required, and prioritizing methods that would produce usable HA–LEU the quickest, including options for acquiring or providing HA–LEU

(i) that

(I) directly meets the needs of an end user; and

(II) has been previously used or fabricated for another purpose;

(ii) that meets the needs of an end user after having radioactive or other contaminants that resulted from a previous use or fabrication of the fuel for research, development, demonstration, or deployment activities of the Department removed;

(iii) that is produced from high-enriched uranium that is blended with lower assay uranium to become HA–LEU to meet the needs of an end user;

(iv) that is produced by Department research, development, and demonstration activities;

(v) that is produced in the United States by

(I) a United States-owned commercial entity operating United States-origin technology;

(II) a United States-owned commercial entity operating a foreign-origin technology; or

(III) a foreign-owned entity operating a foreign-origin technology;

(vi) that does not require extraction of uranium or development of uranium from lands managed by the Federal Government, cause harm to the natural or cultural resources of Tribal communities or sovereign Native Nations, or result in degraded ground or surface water quality on publicly managed or privately owned lands; or

(vii) that does not negatively impact the availability of HA–LEU by the Department to support the production of medical isotopes, including the medical isotopes defined under the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2012 ( Public Law 112–239 ; 126 Stat. 2211 );

(E) not later than 1 year after December 27, 2020 , and biennially thereafter, shall conduct a survey of stakeholders to estimate the quantity of HA–LEU necessary for domestic commercial use for each of the 5 subsequent years;

(F) shall establish, and from time to time update, a consortium, which may include entities involved in any stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, to partner with the Department to support the availability of HA–LEU for civilian domestic demonstration and commercial use, including by

(i) providing information to the Secretary for purposes of surveys conducted under subparagraph (E);

(ii) purchasing HA–LEU made available by the Secretary to members of the consortium for commercial use under the program; and

(iii) carrying out demonstration projects using HA–LEU provided by the Secretary under the program;

(G) if applicable, shall, prior to acquiring or providing HA–LEU under subparagraph (H), in coordination with the consortium established pursuant to subparagraph (F), develop a schedule for cost recovery of HA–LEU made available to members of the consortium using HA–LEU for commercial use pursuant to subparagraph (H);

(H) shall, beginning not later than 3 years after the establishment of a consortium under subparagraph (F), have the capability to acquire or provide HA–LEU, in order to make such HA–LEU available to members of the consortium beginning not later than January 1, 2026 , in amounts that are consistent, to the extent practicable, with

(i) the quantities estimated under the surveys conducted under subparagraph (E); plus

(ii) the quantities necessary for demonstration projects carried out under the program, as determined by the Secretary;

(I) shall, for advanced reactor demonstration projects, prioritize the provision of HA–LEU made available under this section through a merit-based, competitive selection process; and

(J) shall seek to ensure that the activities carried out under this section do not cause any delay in the progress of any HA–LEU project between private industry and the Department that is underway as of December 27, 2020 .

(3) Applicability of USEC Privatization Act

(A) Sale or transfer to consortium

The requirements of section 3112 of the USEC Privatization Act ( 42 U.S.C. 2297h–10 ), except for the requirements of subparagraph (A) of section 3112(d)(2), shall not apply to the provision of enrichment services, or the sale or transfer of HA–LEU for commercial use by the Secretary to a member of the consortium under this subsection.

(B) Demonstration

HA–LEU made available to members of the consortium established pursuant to paragraph (2)(F) for demonstration projects shall remain the property of and title will remain with the Department, which shall be responsible for the storage, use, and disposition of all radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel created by the irradiation, processing, or purification of such uranium, and shall not be subject to the requirements of a sale or transfer of uranium under sections 3112, except for the requirements of subparagraph (A) of section 3112, and 3113 of the USEC Privatization Act ( 42 U.S.C. 2297h–10 ; 42 U.S.C. 2297h–11 ).

(4) National security needs

The Secretary shall only make available to a member of the consortium under this section for commercial or demonstration project use material that the President has determined is not necessary for national security needs, provided that this available material shall not include any material that the Secretary may determine to be necessary for the National Nuclear Security Administration or other critical Departmental missions.

(5) DOE acquisition of HA–LEU

The Secretary may not make commitments under this section (including cooperative agreements (used in accordance with section 6305 of title 31 ), purchase agreements, guarantees, leases, service contracts, or any other type of commitment) for the purchase or other acquisition of HA–LEU unless

(A) funds are specifically provided for such purposes in advance in subsequent appropriations Acts, and only to the extent that the full extent of anticipated costs stemming from such commitments is recorded as an obligation up front and in full at the time it is made; or

(B) such committing agreement includes a clause conditioning the Federal Government’s obligation on the availability of future year appropriations.

(6) Sunset

The authority of the Secretary to carry out the program under this subsection shall expire on the earlier of

(A) September 30, 2034 ; or

(B) 90 days after the date on which HA–LEU is available to provide a reliable and adequate supply for civilian domestic advanced nuclear reactors in the commercial market.

(7) Limitation

The Secretary shall not barter or otherwise sell or transfer uranium in any form in exchange for services relating to the final disposition of radioactive waste from uranium that is made available under this subsection.
