#### § 1396u. Community supported living arrangements services
##### (h) Minimum protections

(1) Publication of interim and final requirements

(A) In general

The Secretary shall publish, by July 1, 1991 , a regulation (that shall be effective on an interim basis pending the promulgation of final regulations), and by October 1, 1992 , a final regulation, that sets forth interim and final requirements, respectively, consistent with subparagraph (B), to protect the health, safety, and welfare of individuals receiving community supported living arrangements services.

(B) Minimum protections

Interim and final requirements under subparagraph (A) shall assure, through methods other than reliance on State licensure processes or the State quality assurance programs under subsection (d), that

(i) individuals receiving community supported living arrangements services are protected from neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and financial exploitation;

(ii) a provider of community supported living arrangements services may not use individuals who have been convicted of child or client abuse, neglect, or mistreatment or of a felony involving physical harm to an individual and shall take all reasonable steps to determine whether applicants for employment by the provider have histories indicating involvement in child or client abuse, neglect, or mistreatment or a criminal record involving physical harm to an individual;

(iii) individuals or entities delivering such services are not unjustly enriched as a result of abusive financial arrangements (such as owner lease-backs); and

(iv) individuals or entities delivering such services to clients, or relatives of such individuals, are prohibited from being named beneficiaries of life insurance policies purchased by (or on behalf of) such clients.

(2) Specified remedies

If the Secretary finds that a provider has not met an applicable requirement under subsection (h), the Secretary shall impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of section 1320a–7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a–7a(a) of this title .
