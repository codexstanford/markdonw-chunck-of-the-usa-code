#### § 17231. Energy storage competitiveness
##### (b) Definitions

In this section:

(1) Council

The term “Council” means the Energy Storage Advisory Council established under subsection (e).

(2) Compressed air energy storage

The term “compressed air energy storage” means, in the case of an electricity grid application, the storage of energy through the compression of air.

(3) Electric drive vehicle

The term “electric drive vehicle” means

(A) a vehicle that uses an electric motor for all or part of the motive power of the vehicle, including battery electric, hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel cell, and plug-in fuel cell vehicles and rail transportation vehicles; or

(B) mobile equipment that uses an electric motor to replace an internal combustion engine for all or part of the work of the equipment.

(4) Islanding

The term “islanding” means a distributed generator or energy storage device continuing to power a location in the absence of electric power from the primary source.

(5) Flywheel

The term “flywheel” means, in the case of an electricity grid application, a device used to store rotational kinetic energy.

(6) Microgrid

The term “microgrid” means an integrated energy system consisting of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources (including generators and energy storage devices), which as an integrated system can operate in parallel with the utility grid or in an intentional islanding mode.

(7) Self-healing grid

The term “self-healing grid” means a grid that is capable of automatically anticipating and responding to power system disturbances (including the isolation of failed sections and components), while optimizing the performance and service of the grid to customers.

(8) Spinning reserve services

The term “spinning reserve services” means a quantity of electric generating capacity in excess of the quantity needed to meet peak electric demand.

(9) Ultracapacitor

The term “ultracapacitor” means an energy storage device that has a power density comparable to a conventional capacitor but is capable of exceeding the energy density of a conventional capacitor by several orders of magnitude.
