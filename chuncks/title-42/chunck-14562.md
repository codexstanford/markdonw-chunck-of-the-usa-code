#### § 6313. Standards
##### (f) Walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers

(1) In general

Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6), each walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer manufactured on or after January 1, 2009 , shall

(A) have automatic door closers that firmly close all walk-in doors that have been closed to within 1 inch of full closure, except that this subparagraph shall not apply to doors wider than 3 feet 9 inches or taller than 7 feet;

(B) have strip doors, spring hinged doors, or other method of minimizing infiltration when doors are open;

(C) contain wall, ceiling, and door insulation of at least R–25 for coolers and R–32 for freezers, except that this subparagraph shall not apply to glazed portions of doors nor to structural members;

(D) contain floor insulation of at least R–28 for freezers;

(E) for evaporator fan motors of under 1 horsepower and less than 460 volts, use

(i) electronically commutated motors (brushless direct current motors); or

(ii) 3-phase motors;

(F) for condenser fan motors of under 1 horsepower, use

(i) electronically commutated motors;

(ii) permanent split capacitor-type motors; or

(iii) 3-phase motors; and

(G) for all interior lights, use light sources with an efficacy of 40 lumens per watt or more, including ballast losses (if any), except that light sources with an efficacy of 40 lumens per watt or less, including ballast losses (if any), may be used in conjunction with a timer or device that turns off the lights within 15 minutes of when the walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer is not occupied by people.

(2) Electronically commutated motors

(A) In general

The requirements of paragraph (1)(E)(i) for electronically commutated motors shall take effect January 1, 2009 , unless, prior to that date, the Secretary determines that such motors are only available from 1 manufacturer.

(B) Other types of motors

In carrying out paragraph (1)(E)(i) and subparagraph (A), the Secretary may allow other types of motors if the Secretary determines that, on average, those other motors use no more energy in evaporator fan applications than electronically commutated motors.

(C) Maximum energy consumption level

The Secretary shall establish the maximum energy consumption level under subparagraph (B) not later than January 1, 2010 .

(3) Additional specifications

Each walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer with transparent reach-in doors manufactured on or after January 1, 2009 , shall also meet the following specifications:

(A) Transparent reach-in doors for walk-in freezers and windows in walk-in freezer doors shall be of triple-pane glass with either heat-reflective treated glass or gas fill.

(B) Transparent reach-in doors for walk-in coolers and windows in walk-in cooler doors shall be

(i) double-pane glass with heat-reflective treated glass and gas fill; or

(ii) triple-pane glass with either heat-reflective treated glass or gas fill.

(C) If the appliance has an antisweat heater without antisweat heat controls, the appliance shall have a total door rail, glass, and frame heater power draw of not more than 7.1 watts per square foot of door opening (for freezers) and 3.0 watts per square foot of door opening (for coolers).

(D) If the appliance has an antisweat heater with antisweat heat controls, and the total door rail, glass, and frame heater power draw is more than 7.1 watts per square foot of door opening (for freezers) and 3.0 watts per square foot of door opening (for coolers), the antisweat heat controls shall reduce the energy use of the antisweat heater in a quantity corresponding to the relative humidity in the air outside the door or to the condensation on the inner glass pane.

(4) Performance-based standards

(A) In general

Not later than January 1, 2012 , the Secretary shall publish performance-based standards for walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers that achieve the maximum improvement in energy that the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.

(B) Application

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), the standards shall apply to products described in subparagraph (A) that are manufactured beginning on the date that is 3 years after the final rule is published.

(ii) Delayed effective date

If the Secretary determines, by rule, that a 3-year period is inadequate, the Secretary may establish an effective date for products manufactured beginning on the date that is not more than 5 years after the date of publication of a final rule for the products.

(5) Amendment of standards

(A) In general

Not later than January 1, 2020 , the Secretary shall publish a final rule to determine if the standards established under paragraph (4) should be amended.

(B) Application

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), the rule shall provide that the standards shall apply to products manufactured beginning on the date that is 3 years after the final rule is published.

(ii) Delayed effective date

If the Secretary determines, by rule, that a 3-year period is inadequate, the Secretary may establish an effective date for products manufactured beginning on the date that is not more than 5 years after the date of publication of a final rule for the products.

(6) Innovative component technologies

Subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) shall not apply to a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer component if the component manufacturer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the component reduces energy consumption at least as much as if such subparagraph were to apply. In support of any demonstration under this paragraph, a manufacturer shall provide to the Secretary all data and technical information necessary to fully evaluate its application.
