#### § 1395ss. Certification of medicare supplemental health insurance policies
##### (l) Transitional compliance with NAIC Model Transition Regulation; “qualifying medicare supplemental policy” and “NAIC Model Transition Regulation” defined
######## (B) In the case of a State which the Secretary identifies as

(i) requiring State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) in order for medicare supplemental policies to meet standards described in subparagraph (A)(i), but

(ii) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in 1989 in a legislative session in which such legislation may be considered, the date specified in this subparagraph is the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first legislative session of the State legislature that begins on or after January 1, 1989 , and in which legislation described in clause (i) may be considered. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.

(4) In the case of a medicare supplemental policy in effect on January 1, 1989 , and offered in a State which, as of such date

(A) has adopted standards equal to or more stringent than the amended NAIC Model Regulation (or Federal model standards), but

(B) does not have in effect standards equal to or more stringent than the NAIC Model Transition Regulation (or otherwise requiring notice substantially the same as the notice required in section 5.B. of such Regulation), the policy shall not be deemed to meet the standards in subsection (c) unless each individual who is entitled to benefits under this subchapter and is a policyholder under such policy on January 1, 1989 , is sent such a notice in any appropriate form by not later than January 31, 1989 , that explains

(A) the improved benefits under this subchapter contained in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, and

(B) how these improvements affect the benefits contained in the policies and the premium for the policy.

(5) In this subsection, the term “NAIC Model Transition Regulation” refers to the standards contained in the “Model Regulation to Implement Transitional Requirements for the Conversion of Medicare Supplement Insurance Benefits and Premiums to Conform to Medicare Program Revisions” (as adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in September 1987).
