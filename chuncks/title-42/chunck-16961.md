Any monetary or in-kind contributions received by a congregate services program under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 [ 42 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.] may be considered for purposes of fulfilling the requirement under this clause. The Secretary concerned shall encourage owners to use excess residual receipts to the extent available to supplement funds for retrofit and supportive services under this section.

The Secretary concerned shall require each such program to maintain, for such 6-year period, the same dollar amount of annual contributions in support of the services eligible for assistance under this section as were contributed to such program during the year preceding November 28, 1990 . 6

(ii) To the extent that the limitations under subsection (d)(7) regarding the percentage of income eligible residents may pay for services will result in collected fees for any congregate services program of less than 10 percent of the cost of providing the program, 50 percent of such remaining costs shall be provided by the recipient of amounts under the contract and 50 percent of such remaining costs shall be provided by the Secretary concerned under such contract.

(C) Eligible supplemental contributions

(D) Prohibition of substitution of funds

The Secretary concerned shall require each State, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, and local nonprofit housing sponsor, that receives assistance under this section to maintain the same dollar amount of annual contribution that such State, Indian tribe, local government, or sponsor was making, if any, in support of services eligible for assistance under this section before the date of the submission of the application for such assistance.

(E) Limitation

For purposes of complying with the requirement under subparagraph (A)(i), the appropriate Secretary concerned may not consider any amounts contributed or provided by any local government to any State receiving assistance under this section that exceed 10 percent of the amount required of the State under subparagraph (A)(i).
