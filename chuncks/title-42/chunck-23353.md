### CHAPTER 161— DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
#### § 18653. Office of Science Biological Threat Preparedness Research Initiative
##### (c) Activities

In carrying out the initiative established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall

(1) determine a comprehensive set of technical milestones for the research activities described in that subsection;

(2) prioritize the objectives of

(A) supporting fundamental research and development in advanced analytics, experimental studies, materials synthesis, and high-performance computing technologies needed in order to more quickly and effectively characterize, model, simulate, and predict complex natural phenomena and biological materials related to emerging biological threats;

(B) supporting the development of tools that inform epidemiological modeling, and applying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other computing tools to accelerate such processes;

(C) supporting research and capabilities that enhance understanding and modeling of the transport of pathogens in indoor and outdoor air and water environments;

(D) identifying priority research opportunities and capabilities for molecular design and modeling for medical countermeasures;

(E) ensuring that new experimental and computational tools are accessible to relevant research communities, including private sector entities and other Federal research institutions; and

(F) supporting activities and projects that combine computational modeling and simulation with experimental research facilities and studies;

(3) leverage the research infrastructure of the Department, including scientific computing user facilities, x-ray light sources, neutron scattering facilities, nanoscale science research centers, and sequencing and biocharacterization facilities;

(4) leverage experience from existing modeling and simulation research and work sponsored by the Department and promote collaboration and data sharing between National Laboratories, research entities, and user facilities of the Department by providing necessary access and secure data transfer capabilities; and

(5) ensure that new experimental and computational tools are accessible to relevant research communities, including private sector entities, to address emerging biological threats.
