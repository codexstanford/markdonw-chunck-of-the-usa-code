##### (g) Noncompliance

(1) In general

The Secretary may not make payments under subsection (a) to a State for any fiscal year subsequent to the first fiscal year of such payments unless the Secretary determines that, for the immediately preceding fiscal year, the State has complied with each of the agreements made by the State under this section.

(2) Reduction in grant relative to number of breached contracts

(A) Before making a grant under subsection (a) to a State for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of contracts provided by the State under paragraph (2) of such subsection with respect to which there has been an initial breach by the health professionals involved during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying to receive the grant.

(B) Subject to paragraph (3), in the case of a State with 1 or more initial breaches for purposes of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce the amount of a grant under subsection (a) to the State for the fiscal year involved by an amount equal to the sum of the expenditures of Federal funds made regarding the contracts involved and an amount representing interest on the amount of such expenditures, determined with respect to each contract on the basis of the maximum legal rate prevailing for loans made during the time amounts were paid under the contract, as determined by the Treasurer of the United States.

(3) Waiver regarding reduction in grant

The Secretary may waive the requirement established in paragraph (2)(B) with respect to the initial breach of a contract if the Secretary determines that such breach by the health professional involved was attributable solely to the professional having a serious illness.
