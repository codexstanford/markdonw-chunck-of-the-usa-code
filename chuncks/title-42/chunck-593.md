### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 247d–6d. Targeted liability protections for pandemic and epidemic products and security countermeasures
##### (c) Definition of willful misconduct

(1) Definition

(A) In general

Except as the meaning of such term is further restricted pursuant to paragraph (2), the term “willful misconduct” shall, for purposes of subsection (d), denote an act or omission that is taken

(i) intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose;

(ii) knowingly without legal or factual justification; and

(iii) in disregard of a known or obvious risk that is so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit.

(B) Rule of construction

The criterion stated in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as establishing a standard for liability that is more stringent than a standard of negligence in any form or recklessness.

(2) Authority to promulgate regulatory definition

(A) In general

The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations, which may be promulgated through interim final rules, that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions by a covered person that may qualify as “willful misconduct” for purposes of subsection (d).

(B) Factors to be considered

In promulgating the regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall consider the need to define the scope of permissible civil actions under subsection (d) in a way that will not adversely affect the public health.

(C) Temporal scope of regulations

The regulations under this paragraph may specify the temporal effect that they shall be given for purposes of subsection (d).

(D) Initial rulemaking

Within 180 days after December 30, 2005 , the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall commence and complete an initial rulemaking process under this paragraph.

(3) Proof of willful misconduct

In an action under subsection (d), the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence willful misconduct by each covered person sued and that such willful misconduct caused death or serious physical injury.

(4) Defense for acts or omissions taken pursuant to Secretary’s declaration

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a program planner or qualified person shall not have engaged in “willful misconduct” as a matter of law where such program planner or qualified person acted consistent with applicable directions, guidelines, or recommendations by the Secretary regarding the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is specified in the declaration under subsection (b), provided either the Secretary, or a State or local health authority, was provided with notice of information regarding serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is material to the plaintiff’s alleged loss within 7 days of the actual discovery of such information by such program planner or qualified person.

(5) Exclusion for regulated activity of manufacturer or distributor

(A) In general

If an act or omission by a manufacturer or distributor with respect to a covered countermeasure, which act or omission is alleged under subsection (e)(3)(A) to constitute willful misconduct, is subject to regulation by this chapter or by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], such act or omission shall not constitute “willful misconduct” for purposes of subsection (d) if

(i) neither the Secretary nor the Attorney General has initiated an enforcement action with respect to such act or omission; or

(ii) such an enforcement action has been initiated and the action has been terminated or finally resolved without a covered remedy. Any action or proceeding under subsection (d) shall be stayed during the pendency of such an enforcement action.
