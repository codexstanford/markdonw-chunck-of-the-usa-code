In evaluating courses of action agreed to by any State or local government, the Secretary shall take into account the past efforts of such State or local government in reducing the various burdens borne by employers and employees in the area involved.

(4) Prohibition of assistance for business relocations

(A) In general

The course of action implemented under paragraph (1) may not include any action to assist

The limitations established in subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary if the Secretary

(i) finds that the establishment of the new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment in the area of original location or in any other area where the existing business entity conducts business operations; and
