### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300a–4. Grants and contracts
##### (c) Prerequisites; “low-income family” defined

A grant may be made or contract entered into under section 300 or 300a of this title for a family planning service project or program only upon assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that

(1) priority will be given in such project or program to the furnishing of such services to persons from low-income families; and

(2) no charge will be made in such project or program for services provided to any person from a low-income family except to the extent that payment will be made by a third party (including a government agency) which is authorized or is under legal obligation to pay such charge. For purposes of this subsection, the term “low-income family” shall be defined by the Secretary in accordance with such criteria as he may prescribe so as to insure that economic status shall not be a deterrent to participation in the programs assisted under this subchapter.
