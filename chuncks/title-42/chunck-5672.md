### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 424a. Reduction of disability benefits
##### (f) Redetermination of reduction

(1) In the second calendar year after the year in which reduction under this section in the total of an individual’s benefits under section 423 of this title and any benefits under section 402 of this title based on his wages and self-employment income was first required (in a continuous period of months), and in each third year thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall redetermine the amount of such benefits which are still subject to reduction under this section; but such redetermination shall not result in any decrease in the total amount of benefits payable under this subchapter on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income. Such redetermined benefit shall be determined as of, and shall become effective with, the January following the year in which such redetermination was made.

(2) In making the redetermination required by paragraph (1), the individual’s average current earnings (as defined in subsection (a)) shall be deemed to be the product of

(A) his average current earnings as initially determined under subsection (a); and

(B) the ratio of (i) the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of this title ) for the calendar year before the year in which such redetermination is made to (ii) the national average wage index (as so defined) for the calendar year before the year in which the reduction was first computed (but not counting any reduction made in benefits for a previous period of disability). Any amount determined under this paragraph which is not a multiple of $1 shall be reduced to the next lower multiple of $1.
