#### § 13492. Program, goals, and plan
##### (b) Program goals

The goals of the program established under subsection (a) shall include

(1) for the near-term

(A) to facilitate the completion, by September 30, 1996 , for certification by the Commission, of standardized advanced light water reactor technology designs that the Secretary determines have the characteristics described in subsection (a)(1) through (4);

(B) to facilitate the completion of submissions, by September 30, 1996 , for preliminary design approvals by the Commission of standardized designs for the modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology and the liquid metal reactor technology; and

(C) to evaluate by September 30, 1996 , actinide burn technology to determine if it can reduce the volume of long-lived fission byproducts;

(2) for the mid-term

(A) to facilitate increased efficiency of enhanced safety, advanced light water reactors to produce electric power at the lowest cost to the customer;

(B) to develop advanced reactor concepts that are passively safe and environmentally acceptable; and

(C) to complete necessary research and development on high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology and liquid metal reactor technology to support the selection, by September 30, 1998 , of one or both of those technologies as appropriate for prototype demonstration; and

(3) for the long-term, to complete research and development and demonstration to support the design of advanced reactor technologies capable of providing electric power to a utility grid as soon as practicable but no later than the year 2010.
