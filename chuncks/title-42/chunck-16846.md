Subject to paragraph (2), no person subject to the requirements of this section shall trade or transfer a production allowance or, after January 1, 2033 , export a regulated substance to a person in a foreign country that, as determined by the Administrator, has not enacted or otherwise established within a reasonable timeframe after December 27, 2020 , the same or similar requirements or otherwise undertaken commitments regarding the production and consumption of regulated substances as are contained in this section.

(2) Transfers

Pursuant to paragraph (1), a person in the United States may engage in a trade or transfer of a production allowance

(A) to a person in a foreign country if, at the time of the transfer, the Administrator revises the number of allowances for production under subsection (e)(2), as applicable, for the United States such that the aggregate national production of the regulated substance to be traded under the revised production limits is equal to the least of

(i) the maximum production level permitted for the applicable regulated substance in the year of the transfer under this section, less the production allowances transferred;

(ii) the maximum production level permitted for the applicable regulated substances in the transfer year under applicable law, less the production allowances transferred; and

(iii) the average of the actual national production level of the applicable regulated substances for the 3-year period ending on the date of the transfer, less the production allowances transferred; or

(B) from a person in a foreign country if, at the time of the trade or transfer, the Administrator finds that the foreign country has revised the domestic production limits of the regulated substance in the same manner as provided with respect to transfers by a person in United  2 States under this subsection.

The Administrator may

(A) reduce the production limits established under subsection (e)(2)(B) as required as a prerequisite to a transfer described in paragraph (2)(A); or
