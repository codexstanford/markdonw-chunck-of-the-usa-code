#### § 5318. Urban development action grants
##### (j) Grant contingent on factors related to non-Federal funds

A grant may be made under this section only where the Secretary determines that there is a strong probability that (1) the non-Federal investment in the project would not be made without the grant, and (2) the grant would not substitute for non-Federal funds which are otherwise available to the project.
