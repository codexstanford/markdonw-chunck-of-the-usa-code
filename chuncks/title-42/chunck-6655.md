(B) the direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening in an alternative location

(i) pursuant to an appropriate State emergency preparedness plan; or

(ii) in the case of a public health emergency described in subsection (g)(1)(B) that involves a pandemic infectious disease, pursuant to a State pandemic preparedness plan or a plan referred to in clause (i), whichever is applicable in the State;

(8) in the case of a telehealth service (as defined in paragraph (4)(F) of section 1395m(m) of this title ) furnished in any emergency area (or portion of such an area) during any portion of any emergency period, the requirements of section 1395m(m) of this title ; and

(9) any requirement under section 1395x(s)(7) of this title or section 1395m( l ) of this title that an ambulance service include the transport of an individual to the extent necessary to allow payment for ground ambulance services furnished in response to a 911 call (or the equivalent in areas without a 911 call system) in cases in which an individual would have been transported to a destination permitted under Medicare regulations (as described in section 410.40 to title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)) but such transport did not occur as a result of community-wide emergency medical service (EMS) protocols due to the public health emergency described in subsection (g)(1)(B). Insofar as the Secretary exercises authority under paragraph (6) with respect to individuals enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan, to the extent possible given the circumstances, the Secretary shall reconcile payments made on behalf of such enrollees to ensure that the enrollees do not pay more than would be required had they received services from providers within the network of the plan and may reconcile payments to the organization offering the plan to ensure that such organization pays for services for which payment is included in the capitation payment it receives under part C of subchapter XVIII. A waiver or modification provided for under paragraph (3) or (7) shall only be in effect if such actions are taken in a manner that does not discriminate among individuals on the basis of their source of payment or of their ability to pay, and, except in the case of a waiver or modification to which the fifth sentence of this subsection applies, shall be limited to a 72-hour period beginning upon implementation of a hospital disaster protocol. A waiver or modification under such paragraph (7) shall be withdrawn after such period and the provider shall comply with the requirements under such paragraph for any patient still under the care of the provider. If a public health emergency described in subsection (g)(1)(B) involves a pandemic infectious disease (such as pandemic influenza), the duration of a waiver or modification under paragraph (3) shall be determined in accordance with subsection (e) as such subsection applies to public health emergencies. Ground ambulance services for which payment is made pursuant to paragraph (9) shall be paid at the base rate that would have been paid under the fee schedule established under  2 1395m( l ) of this title (excluding any mileage payment) if the individual had been so transported and, with respect to ambulance services furnished by a critical access hospital or an entity described in paragraph (8) of such section, at the amount that otherwise would be paid under such paragraph.
