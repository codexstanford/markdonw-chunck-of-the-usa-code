(F) Special payment rules for certain prosthetics and custom-fabricated orthotics

(i) In general

No payment shall be made under this subsection for an item of custom-fabricated orthotics described in clause (ii) or for an item of prosthetics unless such item is

An item described in this clause is an item of custom-fabricated orthotics that requires education, training, and experience to custom-fabricate and that is included in a list established by the Secretary in subclause (II). Such an item does not include shoes and shoe inserts.

(II) List of items

The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate experts in orthotics (including national organizations representing manufacturers of orthotics), shall establish and update as appropriate a list of items to which this subparagraph applies. No item may be included in such list unless the item is individually fabricated for the patient over a positive model of the patient.

In this subparagraph, the term “qualified practitioner” means a physician or other individual who

(I) is a qualified physical therapist or a qualified occupational therapist;

(II) in the case of a State that provides for the licensing of orthotics and prosthetics, is licensed in orthotics or prosthetics by the State in which the item is supplied; or

(G) Replacement of prosthetic devices and parts

(i) In general

Payment shall be made for the replacement of prosthetic devices which are artificial limbs, or for the replacement of any part of such devices, without regard to continuous use or useful lifetime restrictions if an ordering physician determines that the provision of a replacement device, or a replacement part of such a device, is necessary because of any of the following:

(I) A change in the physiological condition of the patient.

(II) An irreparable change in the condition of the device, or in a part of the device.

(ii) Confirmation may be required if device or part being replaced is less than 3 years old

If a physician determines that a replacement device, or a replacement part, is necessary pursuant to clause (i)

(I) such determination shall be controlling; and

(II) such replacement device or part shall be deemed to be reasonable and necessary for purposes of section 1395y(a)(1)(A) of this title ;  except that if the device, or part, being replaced is less than 3 years old (calculated from the date on which the beneficiary began to use the device or part), the Secretary may also require confirmation of necessity of the replacement device or replacement part, as the case may be.

(i) the payment basis under this subsection for such orthotics furnished in such area shall be the payment basis determined under such competitive acquisition program; and
