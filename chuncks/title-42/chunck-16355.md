#### § 7511f. NO x and VOC study

The Administrator, in conjunction with the National Academy of Sciences, shall conduct a study on the role of ozone precursors in tropospheric ozone formation and control. The study shall examine the roles of NO x and VOC emission reductions, the extent to which NO x reductions may contribute (or be counterproductive) to achievement of attainment in different nonattainment areas, the sensitivity of ozone to the control of NO x , the availability and extent of controls for NO x , the role of biogenic VOC emissions, and the basic information required for air quality models. The study shall be completed and a proposed report made public for 30 days comment within 1 year of November 15, 1990 , and a final report shall be submitted to Congress within 15 months after November 15, 1990 . The Administrator shall utilize all available information and studies, as well as develop additional information, in conducting the study required by this section.
