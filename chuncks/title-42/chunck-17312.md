For purposes of this section

(1) The term “just compensation”, when used with respect to any transfer of contractual interests authorized by subsection (a)(1), means the maximum amount of, or method of determining, consideration which does not exceed the amount by which

(A) the reasonable costs (excluding capital costs) incurred, during the remainder of the period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred under subsection (a)(1), in direct association with the use of a fuel, other than natural gas, as a primary energy source by the applicable existing electric powerplant, exceed

(B) the price of natural gas under such contract during such period. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the reasonable costs associated with the use of a fuel, other than natural gas, as a primary energy source shall include an allowance for the amortization, over the remaining useful life, of the undepreciated value of depreciable assets located on the premises containing such electric powerplant, which assets were directly associated with the use of natural gas and are not usable in connection with the use of such other fuel.

(2) The term “just compensation”, when used with respect to subsection (a)(2), means an amount equal to any loss of revenue, during the remaining period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to subsection (a)(1), to the extent such loss (A) is directly incurred by reason of the discontinuation of the transportation or distribution of natural gas resulting from the transfer of contractual interests pursuant to subsection (a)(1), and (B) is not offset by revenues derived from other transportation or distribution which would not have occurred if such contractual interests had not been transferred.

(3) The term “contractual interests”, with respect to a contract described in subsection (a)(1), includes the right to receive natural gas as affected by any applicable curtailment plan filed with the Commission or the appropriate State regulatory authority.

(4) The term “State” means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, and any political subdivision of any of the foregoing.

(5) The term “interstate pipeline” means any person engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [ 15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.].

(6) The term “Commission” means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

(7) The term “contract”, when used with respect to a contract for receipt of natural gas, which contract was in existence on April 20, 1977 , does not include any renewal or extension occurring after such date unless such renewal or extension occurs pursuant to the exercise of an option by the person receiving natural gas under such contract.
