(E) Clinical conditions for coverage

(i) In general

The Secretary shall establish standards for clinical conditions for payment for covered items under this subsection.

(ii) Requirements

The standards established under clause (i) shall include the specification of types or classes of covered items that require, as a condition of payment under this subsection, a face-to-face examination of the individual by a physician (as defined in section 1395x(r) of this title ), a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or a clinical nurse specialist (as those terms are defined in section 1395x(aa)(5) of this title ) and a prescription for the item.

(iii) in the case of covered items furnished on or after January 1, 2016 , the Secretary shall continue to make such adjustments described in clause (ii) as, under such competitive acquisition programs, additional covered items are phased in or information is updated as contracts under section 1395w–3 of this title are recompeted in accordance with section 1395w–3(b)(3)(B) of this title .

(G) Use of information on competitive bid rates

The Secretary shall specify by regulation the methodology to be used in applying the provisions of subparagraph (F)(ii) and subsection (h)(1)(H)(ii).
