### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1382b. Resources
##### (c) Disposal of resources for less than fair market value
######## (C) An individual shall not be ineligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of the application of this paragraph to a disposal of resources by the individual or the spouse of the individual, to the extent that

(i) the resources are a home and title to the home was transferred to

(I) the spouse of the transferor;

(II) a child of the transferor who has not attained 21 years of age, or is blind or disabled;

(III) a sibling of the transferor who has an equity interest in such home and who was residing in the transferor’s home for a period of at least 1 year immediately before the date the transferor becomes an institutionalized individual; or

(IV) a son or daughter of the transferor (other than a child described in subclause (II)) who was residing in the transferor’s home for a period of at least 2 years immediately before the date the transferor becomes an institutionalized individual, and who provided care to the transferor which permitted the transferor to reside at home rather than in such an institution or facility;

(ii) the resources

(I) were transferred to the transferor’s spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the transferor’s spouse;

(II) were transferred from the transferor’s spouse to another for the sole benefit of the transferor’s spouse;

(III) were transferred to, or to a trust (including a trust described in section 1396p(d)(4) of this title ) established solely for the benefit of, the transferor’s child who is blind or disabled; or

(IV) were transferred to a trust (including a trust described in section 1396p(d)(4) of this title ) established solely for the benefit of an individual who has not attained 65 years of age and who is disabled;

(iii) a satisfactory showing is made to the Commissioner of Social Security (in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Commissioner) that

(I) the individual who disposed of the resources intended to dispose of the resources either at fair market value, or for other valuable consideration;

(II) the resources were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for benefits under this subchapter; or

(III) all resources transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the transferor; or

(iv) the Commissioner determines, under procedures established by the Commissioner, that the denial of eligibility would work an undue hardship as determined on the basis of criteria established by the Commissioner.

(D) For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a resource held by an individual in common with another person or persons in a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or similar arrangement, the resource (or the affected portion of such resource) shall be considered to be disposed of by the individual when any action is taken, either by the individual or by any other person, that reduces or eliminates the individual’s ownership or control of such resource.

(E) In the case of a transfer by the spouse of an individual that results in a period of ineligibility for the individual under this subsection, the Commissioner shall apportion the period (or any portion of the period) among the individual and the individual’s spouse if the spouse becomes eligible for benefits under this subchapter.
