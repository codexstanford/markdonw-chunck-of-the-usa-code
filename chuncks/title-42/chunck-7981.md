######## (B) The system described in subparagraph (A) shall include

(i) the services comprising the composite rate established under paragraph (7); and

(ii) the difference between payment amounts under this subchapter for separately billed drugs and biologicals (including erythropoietin) and acquisition costs of such drugs and biologicals, as determined by the Inspector General reports to the Secretary as required by section 623(c) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003

(I) beginning with 2005, for such drugs and biologicals for which a billing code exists prior to January 1, 2004 ; and

(II) beginning with 2007, for such drugs and biologicals for which a billing code does not exist prior to January 1, 2004 , adjusted to 2005, or 2007, respectively, as determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.

(C)

(i) In applying subparagraph (B)(ii) for 2005, such payment amounts under this subchapter shall be determined using the methodology specified in paragraph (13)(A)(i).

(ii) For 2006, the Secretary shall provide for an adjustment to the payments under clause (i) to reflect the difference between the payment amounts using the methodology under paragraph (13)(A)(i) and the payment amount determined using the methodology applied by the Secretary under paragraph (13)(A)(iii) of such paragraph, as estimated by the Secretary.

(D) The Secretary shall adjust the payment rates under such system by a geographic index as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. If the Secretary applies a geographic index under this paragraph that differs from the index applied under paragraph (7) the Secretary shall phase-in the application of the index under this paragraph over a multiyear period.

(E)

(i) Such system shall be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for such services, as estimated by the Secretary, as would have been made for 2005 if this paragraph did not apply.

(ii) The adjustment made under subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) shall be done in a manner to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures after such adjustment as would otherwise have been made for such services for 2006 or 2007, respectively, as estimated by the Secretary, if this paragraph did not apply.
