#### § 15903. Marginal property production incentives
##### (a) Definition of marginal property

Until such time as the Secretary issues regulations under subsection (e) that prescribe a different definition, in this section, the term “marginal property” means an onshore unit, communitization agreement, or lease not within a unit or communitization agreement, that produces on average the combined equivalent of less than 15 barrels of oil per well per day or 90,000,000 British thermal units of gas per well per day calculated based on the average over the 3 most recent production months, including only wells that produce on more than half of the days during those 3 production months.
