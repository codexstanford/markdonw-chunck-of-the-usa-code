### CHAPTER 6A— PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE
#### § 300n. Additional required agreements
##### (c) Statewide provision of services

(1) In general

The Secretary may not make a grant under section 300k of this title unless the State involved agrees that services and activities under the grant will be made available throughout the State, including availability to members of any Indian tribe or tribal organization (as such terms are defined in section 5304 of title 25 ).

(2) Waiver

The Secretary may waive the requirement established in paragraph (1) for a State if the Secretary determines that compliance by the State with the requirement would result in an inefficient allocation of resources with respect to carrying out the purpose described in section 300k(a) of this title .

(3) Grants to tribes and tribal organizations

(A) The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make grants to tribes and tribal organizations (as such terms are used in paragraph (1)) for the purpose of carrying out programs described in section 300k(a) of this title . This subchapter applies to such a grant (in relation to the jurisdiction of the tribe or organization) to the same extent and in the same manner as such subchapter applies to a grant to a State under section 300k of this title (in relation to the jurisdiction of the State).

(B) If a tribe or tribal organization is receiving a grant under subparagraph (A) and the State in which the tribe or organization is located is receiving a grant under section 300k of this title , the requirement established in paragraph (1) for the State regarding the tribe or organization is deemed to have been waived under paragraph (2).
