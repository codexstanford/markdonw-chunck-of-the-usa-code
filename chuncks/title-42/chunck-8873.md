There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a fund which shall be known as the “Child Enrollment Contingency Fund” (in this subsection referred to as the “Fund”). Amounts in the Fund shall be available without further appropriations for payments under this subsection.

(2) Deposits into Fund

(A) Initial and subsequent appropriations

Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (D), out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, there are appropriated to the Fund

(i) for fiscal year 2009, an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount made available under paragraph (12) of subsection (a) for the fiscal year; and

(ii) for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014, 2016, 2018 through 2022, and 2024 through 2026 (and for each of the semi-annual allotment periods for fiscal years 2015, 2017, 2023, and 2027), such sums as are necessary for making payments to eligible States for such fiscal year or period, but not in excess of the aggregate cap described in subparagraph (B).

(B) Aggregate cap

The total amount available for payment from the Fund for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2014, 2016, 2018 through 2022, and 2024 through 2026 (and for each of the semi-annual allotment periods for fiscal years 2015, 2017, 2023, and 2027), taking into account deposits made under subparagraph (C), shall not exceed 20 percent of the amount made available under subsection (a) for the fiscal year or period.

(C) Investment of Fund

The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest, in interest bearing securities of the United States, such currently available portions of the Fund as are not immediately required for payments from the Fund. The income derived from these investments constitutes a part of the Fund.

(D) Availability of excess funds for performance bonuses

Any amounts in excess of the aggregate cap described in subparagraph (B) for a fiscal year or period shall be made available for purposes of carrying out section 1397ee(a)(3) of this title for any succeeding fiscal year and the Secretary of the Treasury shall reduce the amount in the Fund by the amount so made available.

(3) Child Enrollment Contingency Fund payments

(A) In general

If a State’s expenditures under this subchapter in any of fiscal years 2009 through 2014, fiscal year 2016, fiscal years 2018 through 2022, or fiscal years 2024 through 2026 (or a semi-annual allotment period for fiscal year 2015, 2017, 2023, or 2027), exceed the total amount of allotments available under this section to the State in the fiscal year or period (determined without regard to any redistribution it receives under subsection (f) that is available for expenditure during such fiscal year or period, but including any carryover from a previous fiscal year) and if the average monthly unduplicated number of children enrolled under the State plan under this subchapter (including children receiving health care coverage through funds under this subchapter pursuant to a waiver under section 1315 of this title ) during such fiscal year or period exceeds its target average number of such enrollees (as determined under subparagraph (B)) for that fiscal year or period, subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall pay to the State from the Fund an amount equal to the product of

(i) the amount by which such average monthly caseload exceeds such target number of enrollees; and

(ii) the projected per capita expenditures under the State child health plan (as determined under subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year), multiplied by the enhanced FMAP (as defined in section 1397ee(b) of this title ) for the State and fiscal year involved (or in which the period occurs).

(B) Target average number of child enrollees

In this paragraph, the target average number of child enrollees for a State

(i) for fiscal year 2009 is equal to the monthly average unduplicated number of children enrolled in the State child health plan under this subchapter (including such children receiving health care coverage through funds under this subchapter pursuant to a waiver under section 1315 of this title ) during fiscal year 2008 increased by the population growth for children in that State for the year ending on June 30, 2007 (as estimated by the Bureau of the Census) plus 1 percentage point; or

(ii) for a subsequent fiscal year (or semi-annual period occurring in a fiscal year) is equal to the target average number of child enrollees for the State for the previous fiscal year increased by the child population growth factor described in subsection (m)(6)(B) for the State for the prior fiscal year.

(C) Projected per capita expenditures

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the projected per capita expenditures under a State child health plan

(i) for fiscal year 2009 is equal to the average per capita expenditures (including both State and Federal financial participation) under such plan for the targeted low-income children counted in the average monthly caseload for purposes of this paragraph during fiscal year 2008, increased by the annual percentage increase in the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures (as estimated by the Secretary) for 2009; or

(ii) for a subsequent fiscal year (or semi-annual period occurring in a fiscal year) is equal to the projected per capita expenditures under such plan for the previous fiscal year (as determined under clause (i) or this clause) increased by the annual percentage increase in the projected per capita amount of National Health Expenditures (as estimated by the Secretary) for the year in which such subsequent fiscal year ends.

(D) Proration rule

If the amounts available for payment from the Fund for a fiscal year or period are less than the total amount of payments determined under subparagraph (A) for the fiscal year or period, the amount to be paid under such subparagraph to each eligible State shall be reduced proportionally.

(E) Timely payment; reconciliation

Payment under this paragraph for a fiscal year or period shall be made before the end of the fiscal year or period based upon the most recent data for expenditures and enrollment and the provisions of subsection (e) of section 1397ee of this title shall apply to payments under this subsection in the same manner as they apply to payments under such section.

(F) Continued reporting

For purposes of this paragraph and subsection (f), the State shall submit to the Secretary the State’s projected Federal expenditures, even if the amount of such expenditures exceeds the total amount of allotments available to the State in such fiscal year or period.

(G) Application to commonwealths and territories

No payment shall be made under this paragraph to a commonwealth or territory described in subsection (c)(3) until such time as the Secretary determines that there are in effect methods, satisfactory to the Secretary, for the collection and reporting of reliable data regarding the enrollment of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in order to accurately determine the commonwealth’s or territory’s eligibility for, and amount of payment, under this paragraph.
