### CHAPTER 7— SOCIAL SECURITY
#### § 1395w–22. Benefits and beneficiary protections
##### (j) Rules regarding provider participation

(1) Procedures

Insofar as a Medicare+Choice organization offers benefits under a Medicare+Choice plan through agreements with physicians, the organization shall establish reasonable procedures relating to the participation (under an agreement between a physician and the organization) of physicians under such a plan. Such procedures shall include

(A) providing notice of the rules regarding participation,

(B) providing written notice of participation decisions that are adverse to physicians, and

(C) providing a process within the organization for appealing such adverse decisions, including the presentation of information and views of the physician regarding such decision.

(2) Consultation in medical policies

A Medicare+Choice organization shall consult with physicians who have entered into participation agreements with the organization regarding the organization’s medical policy, quality, and medical management procedures.

(3) Prohibiting interference with provider advice to enrollees

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), a Medicare+Choice organization (in relation to an individual enrolled under a Medicare+ÐChoice plan offered by the organization under this part) shall not prohibit or otherwise restrict a covered health care professional (as defined in subparagraph (D)) from advising such an individual who is a patient of the professional about the health status of the individual or medical care or treatment for the individual’s condition or disease, regardless of whether benefits for such care or treatment are provided under the plan, if the professional is acting within the lawful scope of practice.

(B) Conscience protection

Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as requiring a Medicare+Choice plan to provide, reimburse for, or provide coverage of a counseling or referral service if the Medicare+ÐChoice organization offering the plan

(i) objects to the provision of such service on moral or religious grounds; and

(ii) in the manner and through the written instrumentalities such Medicare+ÐChoice organization deems appropriate, makes available information on its policies regarding such service to prospective enrollees before or during enrollment and to enrollees within 90 days after the date that the organization or plan adopts a change in policy regarding such a counseling or referral service.

(C) Construction

Nothing in subparagraph (B) shall be construed to affect disclosure requirements under State law or under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.].

(D) “Health care professional” defined

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “health care professional” means a physician (as defined in section 1395x(r) of this title ) or other health care professional if coverage for the professional’s services is provided under the Medicare+Choice plan for the services of the professional. Such term includes a podiatrist, optometrist, chiropractor, psychologist, dentist, physician assistant, physical or occupational therapist and therapy assistant, speech-language pathologist, audiologist, registered or licensed practical nurse (including nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, and certified nurse-midwife), licensed certified social worker, registered respiratory therapist, and certified respiratory therapy technician.

(4) Limitations on physician incentive plans

(A) In general

No Medicare+Choice organization may operate any physician incentive plan (as defined in subparagraph (B)) unless the organization provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the following requirements are met:

(i) No specific payment is made directly or indirectly under the plan to a physician or physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided with respect to a specific individual enrolled with the organization.

(ii) If the plan places a physician or physician group at substantial financial risk (as determined by the Secretary) for services not provided by the physician or physician group, the organization provides stop-loss protection for the physician or group that is adequate and appropriate, based on standards developed by the Secretary that take into account the number of physicians placed at such substantial financial risk in the group or under the plan and the number of individuals enrolled with the organization who receive services from the physician or group.

(B) “Physician incentive plan” defined

In this paragraph, the term “physician incentive plan” means any compensation arrangement between a Medicare+Choice organization and a physician or physician group that may directly or indirectly have the effect of reducing or limiting services provided with respect to individuals enrolled with the organization under this part.

(5) Limitation on provider indemnification

A Medicare+Choice organization may not provide (directly or indirectly) for a health care professional, provider of services, or other entity providing health care services (or group of such professionals, providers, or entities) to indemnify the organization against any liability resulting from a civil action brought for any damage caused to an enrollee with a Medicare+Choice plan of the organization under this part by the organization’s denial of medically necessary care.

(6) Special rules for Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plans

For purposes of applying this part (including subsection (k)(1)) and section 1395cc(a)(1)(O) of this title , a hospital (or other provider of services), a physician or other health care professional, or other entity furnishing health care services is treated as having an agreement or contract in effect with a Medicare+Choice organization (with respect to an individual enrolled in a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan it offers), if

(A) the provider, professional, or other entity furnishes services that are covered under the plan to such an enrollee; and

(B) before providing such services, the provider, professional, or other entity

(i) has been informed of the individual’s enrollment under the plan, and

(ii) either

(I) has been informed of the terms and conditions of payment for such services under the plan, or

(II) is given a reasonable opportunity to obtain information concerning such terms and conditions,  in a manner reasonably designed to effect informed agreement by a provider. The previous sentence shall only apply in the absence of an explicit agreement between such a provider, professional, or other entity and the Medicare+Choice organization.

(7) Promotion of e-prescribing by MA plans

(A) In general

An MA–PD plan may provide for a separate payment or otherwise provide for a differential payment for a participating physician that prescribes covered part D drugs in accordance with an electronic prescription drug program that meets standards established under section 1395w–104(e) of this title .

(B) Considerations

Such payment may take into consideration the costs of the physician in implementing such a program and may also be increased for those participating physicians who significantly increase

(i) formulary compliance;

(ii) lower cost, therapeutically equivalent alternatives;

(iii) reductions in adverse drug interactions; and

(iv) efficiencies in filing prescriptions through reduced administrative costs.

(C) Structure

Additional or increased payments under this subsection may be structured in the same manner as medication therapy management fees are structured under section 1395w–104(c)(2)(E)  1 of this title.
