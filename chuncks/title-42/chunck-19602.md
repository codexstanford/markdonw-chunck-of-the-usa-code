(4) Support for other national service programs

A Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under paragraph (1) shall, in an appropriate case, enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with an entity that is carrying out a national service program in a State that is in existence in the State as of the date of the contract or cooperative agreement and is of high quality, in order to support the national service program.

(5) Application of requirements

A requirement under this chapter that applies to an entity receiving assistance under this section (other than a requirement limited to an entity receiving assistance under subsection (a)) shall be considered to apply to a Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under this subsection, even though no Federal agency may receive financial assistance under such an agreement.
