#### § 263b. Certification of mammography facilities
##### (j) Injunctions

If the Secretary determines that

(1) continuation of any activity related to the provision of mammography by a facility would constitute a serious risk to human health, the Secretary may bring suit in the district court of the United States for the district in which the facility is situated to enjoin continuation of the activity; and

(2) a facility is operating without a certificate as required by subsection (b), the Secretary may bring suit in the district court of the United States for the district in which the facility is situated to enjoin the operation of the facility. Upon a proper showing, the district court shall grant a temporary injunction or restraining order against continuation of the activity or against operation of a facility, as the case may be, without requiring the Secretary to post a bond, pending issuance of a final order under this subsection.
