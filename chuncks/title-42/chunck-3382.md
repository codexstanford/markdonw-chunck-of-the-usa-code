#### § 299b–35. Grants or contracts to implement medication management services in treatment of chronic diseases
##### (g) Evaluation and report

The Secretary shall submit to the relevant committees of Congress a report which shall

(1) assess the clinical effectiveness of pharmacist-provided services under the MTM services program, as compared to usual care, including an evaluation of whether enrollees maintained better health with fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits than similar patients not enrolled in the program;

(2) assess changes in overall health care resource use by targeted individuals;

(3) assess patient and prescriber satisfaction with MTM services;

(4) assess the impact of patient-cost sharing requirements on medication adherence and recommendations for modifications;

(5) identify and evaluate other factors that may impact clinical and economic outcomes, including demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and health services use of the patient, as well as characteristics of the regimen, pharmacy benefit, and MTM services provided; and

(6) evaluate the extent to which participating pharmacists who maintain a dispensing role have a conflict of interest in the provision of MTM services, and if such conflict is found, provide recommendations on how such a conflict might be appropriately addressed.
