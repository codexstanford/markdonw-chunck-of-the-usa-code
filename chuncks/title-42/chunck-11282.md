(I) radiation source radioactivity levels;

(II) radioactive half-life of a radiation source;

(III) dispersability;

(IV) chemical and material form;

(V) for radioactive materials with a medical use, the availability of the sources to physicians and patients for medical treatment; and

(VI) any other factor that the Chairperson of the Commission determines to be appropriate;

(ii) the establishment of, or modifications to, a national system for recovery of lost or stolen radiation sources;

(iii) the storage of radiation sources that are not used in a safe and secure manner as of the date on which the report is submitted;

(v) the establishment of, or modifications to, a national system (including user fees and other methods) to provide for the proper disposal of radiation sources secured under this chapter;

(vi) modifications to export controls on radiation sources to ensure that foreign recipients of radiation sources are able and willing to adequately control radiation sources from the United States;

(vii)

(I) any alternative technologies available as of the date on which the report is submitted that may perform some or all of the functions performed by devices or processes that employ radiation sources; and

(II) the establishment of appropriate regulations and incentives for the replacement of the devices and processes described in subclause (I)

(aa) with alternative technologies in order to reduce the number of radiation sources in the United States; or

(bb) with radiation sources that would pose a lower risk to public health and safety in the event of an accident or attack involving the radiation source; and

(viii) the creation of, or modifications to, procedures for improving the security of use, transportation, and storage of radiation sources, including

(I) periodic audits or inspections by the Commission to ensure that radiation sources are properly secured and can be fully accounted for;

(II) evaluation of the security measures by the Commission;

(III) increased fines for violations of Commission regulations relating to security and safety measures applicable to licensees that possess radiation sources;

(IV) criminal and security background checks for certain individuals with access to radiation sources (including individuals involved with transporting radiation sources);

(V) requirements for effective and timely exchanges of information relating to the results of criminal and security background checks between the Commission and any State with which the Commission has entered into an agreement under section 2021(b) of this title ;

(VI) assurances of the physical security of facilities that contain radiation sources (including facilities used to temporarily store radiation sources being transported); and

(VII) the screening of shipments to facilities that the Commission determines to be particularly at risk for sabotage of radiation sources to ensure that the shipments do not contain explosives.
