#### § 1769f. Duties of Secretary relating to nonprocurement debarment
##### (e) Mandatory debarment

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary shall initiate nonprocurement debarment proceedings against the contractor (including any cooperative) who has committed the cause for debarment (as determined under subsection (d)(2)), unless the action

(1) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on competition or prices in the relevant market or nationally;

(2) will interfere with the ability of a local agency to procure a needed product for a child nutrition program;

(3) is unfair to a person, subsidiary corporation, affiliate, parent company, or local division of a corporation that is not involved in the improper activity that would otherwise result in the debarment;

(4) is likely to have significant adverse economic impacts on the local economy in a manner that is unfair to innocent parties;

(5) is not justified in light of the penalties already imposed on the contractor for violations relevant to the proposed debarment, including any suspension or debarment arising out of the same matter that is imposed by any Federal or State agency; or

(6) is not in the public interest, or otherwise is not in the interests of justice, as determined by the Secretary.
