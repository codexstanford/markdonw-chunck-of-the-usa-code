#### § 8232. Residential energy efficiency standards study
##### (b) Specific factors

In conducting such study, the Secretary shall consider at least the following factors

(1) the extent to which such requirement would protect a prospective purchaser from the uncertainty of not knowing the energy efficiency of the property he proposes to purchase;

(2) the extent to which such requirement would contribute to the Nation’s energy conservation goals;

(3) the extent to which such a requirement would affect the real estate, home building, and mortgage banking industries;

(4) the sanctions which might be necessary to make such a requirement effective and the administrative impediments there might be to enforcement of such sanctions;

(5) the possible impact on sellers and purchasers as a result of the implementation of mandatory Federal actions, taking into account the experience of the Federal Government in imposing mandatory requirements concerning the purchase and sale of real property as occurred under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [ 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.] and the Federal Disaster Protection Act of 1973;

(6) an analysis of the effect of such a requirement on the economy as a whole and on the Nation’s security as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets caused by such a requirement;

(7) the effect of such a requirement on availability of credit in the housing industry;

(8) the extent to which the imposition of mandatory Federal requirements would temporarily reduce the number of residential dwellings available for sale and the resulting effect of such mandatory actions on the price of those remaining dwelling units eligible for sale; and

(9) the possible uncertainty, during the period of developing the standards, as to what standards might be imposed and any resulting effect on major housing rehabilitation efforts and voluntary efforts for energy conservation.
