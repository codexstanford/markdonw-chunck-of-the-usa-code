If the Surgeon General refuses to approve any application for a project submitted under section 291e of this title or section 291j of this title , the State agency through which such application was submitted, or if any State is dissatisfied with his action under section 291g of this title such State may appeal to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located, by filing a petition with such court within sixty days after such action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Surgeon General, or any officer designated by him for that purpose. The Surgeon General shall thereupon file in the court the record of the proceedings on which he based his action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28 . Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Surgeon General or to set it aside, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently, but until the filing of the record, the Surgeon General may modify or set aside his order.
