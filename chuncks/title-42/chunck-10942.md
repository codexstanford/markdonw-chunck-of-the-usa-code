#### § 2022. Health and environmental standards for uranium mill tailings
##### (f) Implementation or enforcement of Uranium Mill Licensing Requirements

(1) Prior to January 1, 1983 , the Commission shall not implement or enforce the provisions of the Uranium Mill Licensing Requirements published as final rules at 45 Federal Register 65521 to 65538 on October 3, 1980 (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “October 3 regulations”). After December 31, 1982 , the Commission is authorized to implement and enforce the provisions of such October 3 regulations (and any subsequent modifications or additions to such regulations which may be adopted by the Commission), except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.

(2) Following the proposal by the Administrator of standards under subsection (b), the Commission shall review the October 3 regulations, and, not later than 90 days after the date of such proposal, suspend implementation and enforcement of any provision of such regulations which the Commission determines after notice and opportunity for public comment to require a major action or major commitment by licensees which would be unnecessary if

(A) the standards proposed by the Administrator are promulgated in final form without modification, and

(B) the Commission’s requirements are modified to conform to such standards. Such suspension shall terminate on the earlier of April 1, 1984 or the date on which the Commission amends the October 3 regulations to conform to final standards promulgated by the Administrator under subsection (b). During the period of such suspension, the Commission shall continue to regulate byproduct material (as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title ) under this chapter on a licensee-by-licensee basis as the Commission deems necessary to protect public health, safety, and the environment.

(3) Not later than 6 months after the date on which the Administrator promulgates final standards pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, amend the October 3 regulations, and adopt such modifications, as the Commission deems necessary to conform to such final standards of the Administrator.

(4) Nothing in this subsection may be construed as affecting the authority or responsibility of the Commission under section 2114 of this title to promulgate regulations to protect the public health and safety and the environment.
