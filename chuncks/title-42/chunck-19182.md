#### § 11411. Use of unutilized and underutilized public buildings and real property to assist the homeless
##### (f) Making property available to representatives of homeless

(1) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, property for which the Secretary of Health and Human Services has approved an application under subsection (e) shall be made promptly available, at the applicant’s discretion, by permit or lease, or by deed as a public health use under section 550(a)–(d) of title 40, to the representative of the homeless that submitted the application.

(2) Unutilized or underutilized property that is the subject of an agency’s statement of intention under subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii) shall be made promptly available by the appropriate landholding agency to the approved applicant by lease or permit for a term of not less than 1 year, unless the applicant requests a shorter term.

(3)

(A) In disposing of surplus property by deed or lease under sections 541–555 of title 40, the Administrator and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall give priority of consideration to uses to assist the homeless, unless the Administrator or the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that a competing request for the property under section 550 of title 40 is so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.

(B) Whenever the Administrator or the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes a determination under subparagraph (A), the Administrator or the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory statement detailing the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus property and the reasons for determining that such need was so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.

(4) For any property made available by lease to a representative of the homeless before November 29, 1990 , the Secretary of Health and Human Services may, upon written request by the representative, convey such property by deed to the representative in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, section 550 of title 40 . The lease term shall not be affected if a deed is not granted.
