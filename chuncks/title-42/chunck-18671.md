#### § 10367. Water data enhancement by United States Geological Survey
##### (a) National streamflow information program

(1) In general

The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee and the Panel and consistent with this section, shall proceed with implementation of the national streamflow information program, as reviewed by the National Research Council in 2004.

(2) Requirements

In conducting the national streamflow information program, the Secretary shall

(A) measure streamflow and related environmental variables in nationally significant watersheds

(i) in a reliable and continuous manner; and

(ii) to develop a comprehensive source of information on which public and private decisions relating to the management of water resources may be based;

(B) provide for a better understanding of hydrologic extremes (including floods and droughts) through the conduct of intensive data collection activities during and following hydrologic extremes;

(C) establish a base network that provides resources that are necessary for

(i) the monitoring of long-term changes in streamflow; and

(ii) the conduct of assessments to determine the extent to which each long-term change monitored under clause (i) is related to global climate change;

(D) integrate the national streamflow information program with data collection activities of Federal agencies and appropriate State water resource agencies (including the National Integrated Drought Information System)

(i) to enhance the comprehensive understanding of water availability;

(ii) to improve flood-hazard assessments;

(iii) to identify any data gap with respect to water resources; and

(iv) to improve hydrologic forecasting; and

(E) incorporate principles of adaptive management in the conduct of periodic reviews of information collected under the national streamflow information program to assess whether the objectives of the national streamflow information program are being adequately addressed.

(3) Improved methodologies

The Secretary shall

(A) improve methodologies relating to the analysis and delivery of data; and

(B) investigate, develop, and implement new methodologies and technologies to estimate or measure streamflow in a more cost-efficient manner.

(4) Network enhancement

(A) In general

Not later than 10 years after March 30, 2009 , in accordance with subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall

(i) increase the number of streamgages funded by the national streamflow information program to a quantity of not less than 4,700 sites; and

(ii) ensure all streamgages are flood-hardened and equipped with water-quality sensors and modernized telemetry.

(B) Requirements of sites

Each site described in subparagraph (A) shall conform with the National Streamflow Information Program plan as reviewed by the National Research Council.

(5) Federal share

The Federal share of the national streamgaging network established pursuant to this subsection shall be 100 percent of the cost of carrying out the national streamgaging network.

(6) Authorization of appropriations

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to operate the national streamflow information program for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2023, to remain available until expended.

(B) Network enhancement funding

There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the network enhancements described in paragraph (4) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2019, to remain available until expended.
