#### § 7276b. Integrated resource plans
##### (e) Enforcement

(1) No approved plan

If an integrated resource plan for any customer is not submitted before the date 12 months after the guidelines are amended as required under this section or if the plan is disapproved by the Administrator and a revised plan is not resubmitted by the date 9 months after the date of such disapproval, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge of 10 percent of the purchase price on all power obtained by that customer from the Western Area Power Administration after such date. The surcharge shall remain in effect until an integrated resource plan is approved for that customer. If the plan is not submitted for more than one year after the required date, the surcharge shall increase to 20 percent for the second year (or any portion thereof prior to approval of the plan) and to 30 percent thereafter until the plan is submitted or the contract for the purchase of power by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration terminates.

(2) Failure to comply with approved plan

After approval by the Administrator of an applicable integrated resource plan for any customer, the Administrator shall impose a 10 percent surcharge on all power purchased by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration whenever the Administrator determines that such customer’s activities are not consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall remain in effect until the Administrator determines that the customer’s activities are consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall be increased to 20 percent if the customer’s activities are out of compliance for more than one year and to 30 percent after more than 2 years, except that no surcharge shall be imposed if the customer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.

(3) Reduction in power allocation

In the case of any customer subject to a surcharge under paragraph (1) or (2), in lieu of imposing such surcharge the Administrator may reduce such customer’s power allocation from the Western Area Power Administration by 10 percent. The Administrator shall provide by regulation the terms and conditions under which a power allocation terminated under this subsection may be reinstated.
