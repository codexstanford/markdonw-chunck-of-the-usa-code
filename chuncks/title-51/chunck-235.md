###### (b) Research and Development Initiative on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas and Noise Emissions From Aircraft.

(1) In general .

The Administrator shall establish an initiative to research, develop, and demonstrate new technologies and concepts

(A) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, other greenhouse gases, water vapor, black carbon and sulfate aerosols, and increased cloudiness due to contrail formation;

(B) to reduce aviation noise emissions; and

(C) to enable associated aircraft performance characteristics.

(2) Goals .

The goals of the initiative required by paragraph (1) shall be

(A) to ensure United States leadership in research and technology innovation leading to substantial reductions in aviation noise and greenhouse gas emissions;

(B) to enhance and expand basic research, and the translation of basic research into applications, that may lead to transformational advances in reducing aviation noise and greenhouse gas emissions;

(C) to accelerate research and development that contributes to maturing new technologies for reducing aircraft noise and greenhouse gas emissions; and

(D) to obtain and disseminate associated testing and performance data that facilitates the incorporation of new technologies into commercial aircraft development as soon as practicable.

(3) Objectives .

The objectives of the initiative established under paragraph (1) and the goals described in paragraph (2) shall include

(A) as soon as practicable, a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from new aircraft by at least 50 percent, as compared to the highest-performing aircraft technologies in service as of December 31, 2021 ;

(B) noise levels from aircraft throughout all phases of flight that do not exceed ambient noise levels in the absence of flight operations in the vicinity of the flight route;

(C) net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft by 2050; and

(D) demonstration of new technologies developed pursuant to such initiative on

(i) regional aircraft intended to enter into service by 2030; and

(ii) single-aisle aircraft designed to accommodate more than 125 passengers intended to enter into service by 2040.
