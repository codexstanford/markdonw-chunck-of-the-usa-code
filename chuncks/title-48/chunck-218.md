#### § 1492. Energy resources of Caribbean and Pacific insular areas
##### (g) Financial assistance

(1) The Secretary of Energy may grant financial assistance, not to exceed $2,000,000 annually, to insular area governments or private sector persons working in cooperation with insular area governments to carry out projects to evaluate the feasibility of, develop options for, and encourage the adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures which reduce the dependency of the insular areas on imported fuels, improve the quality of the environment, and promote development in the insular areas.

(2) Any applicant for financial assistance under this subsection must evidence coordination and cooperation with, and support from, the affected local energy institutions.

(3) In determining the amount of financial assistance to be provided for a proposed project, the Secretary shall consider

(A) whether the measure will reduce the relative dependence of the insular area on imported fuels;

(B) the ease and costs of operation and maintenance of any facilities contemplated as a part of the project;

(C) whether the project will rely on the use of conservation measures or indigenous, renewable energy resources that were identified in the 1982 Territorial Energy Assessment or that are identified by the Secretary as consistent with the purposes of this subsection;

(D) whether the measure will contribute significantly to development and the quality of the environment in the insular area; and

(E) any other factors which the Secretary may determine to be relevant to a particular project.

(4) Power line grants for insular areas.

(v) The project design has taken into consideration long-term changes to the areas and persons it is designed to protect and has manageable future maintenance and modification requirements.

(vi) The project plan includes an analysis of a range of options to address the problem it is designed to prevent or mitigate and a justification for the selection of the project in light of that analysis.

(D) Matching requirement .

The Federal share of the cost for a project for which a grant is provided under this paragraph shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost of that project. The non-Federal share of the cost may be provided in the form of cash or services.
