The United States shall expeditiously resolve the matter of any nonpayment of funds required under paragraph (1) pursuant to section 313 of the U.S.-RMI Compact and the authority and responsibility of the Government of the United States for security and defense matters in or relating to the Marshall Islands. This paragraph shall be enforced, as may be necessary, in accordance with section 1921d(e) of this title .
