#### § 2124. Powers of Oversight Board
##### (i) Voluntary agreement certification

(1) In general

The Oversight Board shall issue a certification to a covered territory or covered territorial instrumentality if the Oversight Board determines, in its sole discretion, that such covered territory or covered territorial instrumentality, as applicable, has successfully reached a voluntary agreement with holders of its Bond Claims to restructure such Bond Claims

(A) except as provided in subparagraph (C), if an applicable Fiscal Plan has been certified, in a manner that provides for a sustainable level of debt for such covered territory or covered territorial instrumentality, as applicable, and is in conformance with the applicable certified Fiscal Plan;

(B) except as provided in subparagraph (C), if an applicable Fiscal Plan has not yet been certified, in a manner that provides, in the Oversight Board’s sole discretion, for a sustainable level of debt for such covered territory or covered territorial instrumentality; or

(C) notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), if an applicable Fiscal Plan has not yet been certified and the voluntary agreement is limited solely to an extension of applicable principal maturities and interest on Bonds issued by such covered territory or covered territorial instrumentality, as applicable, for a period of up to one year during which time no interest will be paid on the Bond Claims affected by the voluntary agreement.

(2) Effectiveness

The effectiveness of any voluntary agreement referred to in paragraph (1) shall be conditioned on

(A) the Oversight Board delivering the certification described in paragraph (1); and

(B) the agreement of a majority in amount of the Bond Claims of a covered territory or a covered territorial instrumentality that are to be affected by such agreement, provided, however, that such agreement is solely for purposes of serving as a Qualifying Modification pursuant to subsection  1 2231(g) of this title and shall not alter existing legal rights of holders of Bond Claims against such covered territory or covered territorial instrumentality that have not assented to such agreement until an order approving the Qualifying Modification has been entered pursuant to section 2231(m)(1)(D) of this title .

(3) Preexisting voluntary agreements

Any voluntary agreement that the territorial government or any territorial instrumentality has executed before May 18, 2016 , with holders of a majority in amount of Bond Claims that are to be affected by such agreement to restructure such Bond Claims shall be deemed to be in conformance with the requirements of this subsection.
