(1) Authority of President

The President of the United States shall have no authority to suspend or withhold payments or assistance with respect to

(A) section 177, 213, 216(a)(2), 216(a)(3), 221(b), or 223 of the Compact, or

(B) any agreements made pursuant to such sections of the Compact, unless such suspension or withholding is imposed as a sanction due to noncompliance by the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Government of the Marshall Islands (as the case may be) with the obligations and requirements of such sections of the Compact or such agreements.

(2) Actions incompatible with United States authority

The Congress expresses its understanding that the Governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands will not act in a manner incompatible with the authority and responsibility of the United States for security and defense matters in or related to the Federated States of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands pursuant to the Compact, including the agreements referred to in sections 462(j) and 462(k) thereof. The Congress further expresses its intention that any such act on the part of either such Government will be viewed by the United States as a material breach of the Compact. The Government of the United States reserves the right in the event of such a material breach of the Compact by the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Government of the Marshall Islands to take action, including (but not limited to) the suspension in whole or in part of the obligations of the Government of the United States to that Government.
