### CHAPTER 18— MICRONESIA, MARSHALL ISLANDS, AND PALAU
#### § 1933. Supplemental provisions
##### (h) Additional provisions relating to Title Three of Compact

(1) The Government of the United States recognizes and respects the scarcity and special importance of land in Palau. In making any designation of land pursuant to section 322 of the Compact, the Government of the United States shall follow the policy of requesting the minimum area necessary to accomplish the required security and defense purpose, of requesting only the minimum interest in real property necessary to support such purpose, and of requesting first to satisfy the requirement through public real property, where available, rather than through private real property.

(2) The Armed Forces of other nations invited to use military areas and facilities in Palau pursuant to section 312 of the Compact shall be permitted only as it is incident to the authority and under the control of the United States. The activities of such third country forces shall be subject to the same limitations and restrictions applicable to the authority of the United States under the terms of the Compact.

(3) The Government of the United States considers “Exclusive use” areas established for the United States pursuant to Title Three of the Compact to be “within the jurisdiction of Palau,” as that term is used in section 324 of the Compact.
