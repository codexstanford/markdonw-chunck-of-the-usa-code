##### (p) Establishment of trust funds; expedition of process

(1) In general

The Trust Fund Agreement executed pursuant to the U.S.-FSM Compact and the Trust Fund Agreement executed pursuant to the U.S.-RMI Compact each provides for the establishment of a trust fund.

(2) Method of establishment

The trust fund may be established by

(A) creating a new legal entity to constitute the trust fund; or

(B) assuming control of an existing legal entity including, without limitation, a trust fund or other legal entity that was established by or at the direction of the Government of the United States, the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or otherwise for the purpose of facilitating or expediting the establishment of the trust fund pursuant to the applicable Trust Fund Agreement.

(3) Obligations

For the purpose of expediting the commencement of operations of a trust fund under either Trust Fund Agreement, the trust fund may, but shall not be obligated to, assume any obligations of an existing legal entity and take assignment of any contract or other agreement to which the existing legal entity is party.

(4) Assistance

Without limiting the authority that the United States Government may otherwise have under applicable law, the United States Government may, but shall not be obligated to, provide financial, technical, or other assistance directly or indirectly to the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the purpose of establishing and operating a trust fund or other legal entity that will solicit bids from, and enter into contracts with, parties willing to serve in such capacities as trustee, depositary, money manager, or investment advisor, with the intention that the contracts will ultimately be assumed by and assigned to a trust fund established pursuant to a Trust Fund Agreement.
