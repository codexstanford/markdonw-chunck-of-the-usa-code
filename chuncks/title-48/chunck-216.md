### CHAPTER 10— TERRITORIAL PROVISIONS OF A GENERAL NATURE
#### § 1492. Energy resources of Caribbean and Pacific insular areas
##### (e) Updating of plans; submission to Congress

(1) The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the head of government of each insular area, shall update the plans required under subsection (c) by

(A) updating the contents required by subsection (c);

(B) drafting long-term energy plans for such insular areas with the objective of reducing, to the extent feasible, their reliance on energy imports by the year 2012, increasing energy conservation and energy efficiency, and maximizing, to the extent feasible, use of indigenous energy sources; and

(C) drafting long-term energy transmission line plans for such insular areas with the objective that the maximum percentage feasible of electric power transmission and distribution lines in each insular area be protected from damage caused by hurricanes and typhoons.

(2) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary of Energy shall identify and evaluate the strategies or projects with the greatest potential for reducing the dependence on imported fossil fuels as used for the generation of electricity, including strategies and projects for

(A) improved supply-side efficiency of centralized electrical generation, transmission, and distribution systems;

(B) improved demand-side management through

(i) the application of established standards for energy efficiency for appliances;

(ii) the conduct of energy audits for business and industrial customers; and

(iii) the use of energy savings performance contracts;

(C) increased use of renewable energy, including

(i) solar thermal energy for electric generation;

(ii) solar thermal energy for water heating in large buildings, such as hotels, hospitals, government buildings, and residences;

(iii) photovoltaic energy;

(iv) wind energy;

(v) hydroelectric energy;

(vi) wave energy;

(vii) energy from ocean thermal resources, including ocean thermal-cooling for community air conditioning;

(viii) water vapor condensation for the production of potable water;

(ix) fossil fuel and renewable hybrid electrical generation systems; and

(x) other strategies or projects that the Secretary may identify as having significant potential; and

(D) fuel substitution and minimization with indigenous biofuels, such as coconut oil.

(3) In carrying out this subsection, for each insular area with a significant need for distributed generation, the Secretary of Energy shall identify and evaluate the most promising strategies and projects described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (2) for meeting that need.

(4) In assessing the potential of any strategy or project under paragraphs (2) and (3), the Secretary of Energy shall consider

(A) the estimated cost of the power or energy to be produced, including

(i) any additional costs associated with the distribution of the generation; and

(ii) the long-term availability of the generation source;

(B) the capacity of the local electrical utility to manage, operate, and maintain any project that may be undertaken; and

(C) other factors the Secretary of Energy considers to be appropriate.

(5) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005 , the Secretary of the Interior shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, the updated plans for each insular area required by this subsection.
