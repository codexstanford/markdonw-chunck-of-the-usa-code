### CHAPTER 20— PUERTO RICO OVERSIGHT, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMIC STABILITY
#### § 2231. Creditor collective action
##### (d) Determination of Pools for voting

The Administrative Supervisor, in consultation with the Issuer, shall establish Pools in accordance with the following:

(1) Not less than one Pool shall be established for each Issuer.

(2) A Pool that contains one or more Bonds that are secured by a lien on property shall be a Secured Pool.

(3) The Administrative Supervisor shall establish Pools according to the following principles:

(A) For each Issuer that has issued multiple Bonds that are distinguished by specific provisions governing priority or security arrangements, including Bonds that have been issued as general obligations of the Territory Government Issuer to which the Territory Government Issuer pledged the full or good faith, credit, and taxing power of the Territory Government Issuer, separate Pools shall be established corresponding to the relative priority or security arrangements of each holder of Bonds against each Issuer, as applicable, provided, however, that the term “priority” as used in this section shall not be understood to mean differing payment or maturity dates.

(B) For each Issuer that has issued senior and subordinated Bonds, separate Pools shall be established for the senior and subordinated Bonds corresponding to the relative priority or security arrangements.

(C) For each Issuer that has issued multiple Bonds, for at least some of which a guarantee of repayment has been provided by the Territory Government Issuer, separate Pools shall be established for such guaranteed and non-guaranteed Bonds.

(D) Subject to the other requirements contained in this section, for each Issuer that has issued multiple Bonds, for at least some of which a dedicated revenue stream has been pledged for repayment, separate Pools for such Issuer shall be established as follows

(i) for each dedicated revenue stream that has been pledged for repayment, not less than one Secured Pool for Bonds for which such revenue stream has been pledged, and separate Secured Pools shall be established for Bonds of different priority; and

(ii) not less than one Pool for all other Bonds issued by the Issuer for which a dedicated revenue stream has not been pledged for repayment.

(E) The Administrative Supervisor shall not place into separate Pools Bonds of the same Issuer that have identical rights in security or priority.

(4) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, solely with respect to a preexisting voluntary agreement as described in section 2124(i)(3) of this title , such voluntary agreement may classify Insured Bonds and uninsured bonds in different Pools and provide different treatment thereof so long as the preexisting voluntary agreement has been agreed to by

(A) holders of a majority in amount of all uninsured bonds outstanding in the modified Pool; and

(B) holders (including insurers with power to vote) of a majority in amount of all Insured Bonds.
