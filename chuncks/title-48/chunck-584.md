#### § 1960. Modification of energy assistance funding
##### (a) Fulfillment of United States obligations

The President is authorized to negotiate and conclude an agreement, including the obligation of United States funds, with the Government of Palau which shall provide the following:

(1) The sum of $28,000,000, adjusted by section 215 of the Compact at the time of its availability to Palau, shall be provided to Palau pursuant to section 211(b) of the Compact and upon entry into force of the Compact.

(2) Palau shall pay to the United States, on or before the 15th anniversary of the effective date of the Compact, an amount equal to the net economic cost to the United States of making available the section 211(b) funds in the manner specified in this subsection rather than as provided in section 211(b).

(3) Such economic cost shall reflect the time value of money and be determined using the rate determined for an equivalent loan by the Federal Financing Bank as of the date these funds are advanced, and using an inflation rate consistent with the determinations made under the provisions of section 215 of the Compact.

(4) If the Government of Palau has not paid such net economic costs to the United States by the 15th anniversary of the effective date of the Compact, then the United States shall be automatically paid such sums from the fund established under section 211(f) of the Compact.

(5) The provision of section 211(b) funds, as appropriated by Public Law 99–349 and pursuant to this subsection, shall be in fulfillment of all United States obligations under such section 211(b) of the Compact and shall be subject to section 236 of the Compact.
