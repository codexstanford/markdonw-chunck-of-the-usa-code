(B) the term “qualified nonimmigrant” means a person, or their children under the age of 18, admitted or resident pursuant to section 141 of the U.S.-RMI or U.S.-FSM Compact, or section 141 of the Palau Compact who, as of a date referenced in the most recently published enumeration is a resident of an affected jurisdiction. As used in this subsection, the term “resident” shall be a person who has a “residence,” as that term is defined in section 101(a)(33) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended [ 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(33) ].

(3) Authorization and continuing appropriation

There is hereby authorized and appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to remain available until expended, for each fiscal year from 2004 through 2023, $30,000,000 for grants to affected jurisdictions to aid in defraying costs incurred by affected jurisdictions as a result of increased demands placed on health, educational, social, or public safety services or infrastructure related to such services due to the residence in affected jurisdictions of qualified nonimmigrants from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau.

(5) Allocation

The Secretary of the Interior shall allocate to the government of each affected jurisdiction, on the basis of the results of the most recent enumeration, grants in an aggregate amount equal to the total amount of funds appropriated under paragraph (3) of this subsection, as reduced by any deductions authorized by subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of this subsection, multiplied by a ratio derived by dividing the number of qualified nonimmigrants in such affected jurisdiction by the total number of qualified nonimmigrants in all affected jurisdictions.
