### CHAPTER 18— MICRONESIA, MARSHALL ISLANDS, AND PALAU
#### § 1921b. Agreements with and other provisions related to the Republic of the Marshall Islands
##### (b) Ejit

(1) In the joint resolution of January 14, 1986 ( Public Law 99–239 ) Congress provided that the President of the United States shall negotiate with the Government of the Marshall Islands an agreement whereby, without prejudice as to any claims which have been or may be asserted by any party as to rightful title and ownership of any lands on Ejit, the Government of the Marshall Islands shall assure that lands on Ejit used as of January 1, 1985 , by the people of Bikini, will continue to be available without charge for their use, until such time as Bikini is restored and inhabitable and the continued use of Ejit is no longer necessary, unless a Marshall Islands court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that there are legal impediments to continued use of Ejit by the people of Bikini.

(2) In the joint resolution of January 14, 1986 ( Public Law 99–239 ) Congress provided that if the impediments described in paragraph (1) do arise, the United States will cooperate with the Government of the Marshall Islands in assisting any person adversely affected by such judicial determination to remain on Ejit, or in locating suitable and acceptable alternative lands for such person’s use.

(3) In the joint resolution of January 14, 1986 ( Public Law 99–239 ) Congress provided that paragraph (1) shall not be applied in a manner which would prevent the Government of the Marshall Islands from acting in accordance with its constitutional processes to resolve title and ownership claims with respect to such lands or from taking substitute or additional measures to meet the needs of the people of Bikini with their democratically expressed consent and approval.
