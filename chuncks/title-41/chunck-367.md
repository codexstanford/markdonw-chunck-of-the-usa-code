(1) When allowed .

A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if

(B) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in section 3502(c) of this title before that date.

(2) When not allowed .

A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if
