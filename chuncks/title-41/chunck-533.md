(2) ensure that neither a contractor nor a subcontractor receives indirect costs or profit on work performed by a lower-tier subcontractor to which the higher-tier contractor or subcontractor adds no or negligible value (but not to limit charges for indirect costs and profit based on the direct costs of managing lower-tier subcontracts).
