#### § 3304. Use of noncompetitive procedures
###### (b) Property or Services Deemed Available From Only One Source .

For the purposes of subsection (a)(1), in the case of

(1) a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services are deemed to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept, the substance of which is not otherwise available to the Federal Government and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; or

(2) a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in

(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Federal Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or

(B) unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency’s needs.
