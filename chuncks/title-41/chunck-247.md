The policy shall

(iii) report any personal conflict-of-interest violation by an employee to the applicable contracting officer or contracting officer’s representative as soon as it is identified;

(iv) maintain effective oversight to verify compliance with personal conflict-of-interest safeguards;

(v) have procedures in place to screen for potential conflicts of interest for all employees performing relevant acquisition functions; and

(vi) take appropriate disciplinary action in the case of employees who fail to comply with policies established pursuant to this section.

(3) Contract clause.

(A) Contents .

The Administrator shall develop a personal conflicts-of-interest clause or a set of clauses for inclusion in solicitations and contracts (and task or delivery orders) for the performance of relevant acquisition functions that sets forth

(i) the personal conflicts-of-interest policy developed under this subsection; and

(ii) the contractor’s responsibilities under the policy.

Subparagraph (A) shall take effect 300 days after October 14, 2008 , and shall apply to

This subsection shall apply to any contract for an amount in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of this title ) if the contract is for the performance of relevant acquisition functions.
