###### (f) Time for Issuance of Decision.

(1) Claim of $100,000 or less .

A contracting officer shall issue a decision on any submitted claim of $100,000 or less within 60 days from the contracting officer’s receipt of a written request from the contractor that a decision be rendered within that period.

(2) Claim of more than $100,000 .

A contracting officer shall, within 60 days of receipt of a submitted certified claim over $100,000

(A) issue a decision; or

(B) notify the contractor of the time within which a decision will be issued.

(3) General requirement of reasonableness .

The decision of a contracting officer on submitted claims shall be issued within a reasonable time, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the agency, taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of information in support of the claim provided by the contractor.

(4) Requesting tribunal to direct issuance within specified time period .

A contractor may request the tribunal concerned to direct a contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the tribunal concerned, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.

(5) Failure to issue decision within required time period .

Failure by a contracting officer to issue a decision on a claim within the required time period is deemed to be a decision by the contracting officer denying the claim and authorizes an appeal or action on the claim as otherwise provided in this chapter. However, the tribunal concerned may, at its option, stay the proceedings of the appeal or action to obtain a decision by the contracting officer.
