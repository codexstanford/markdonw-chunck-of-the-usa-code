###### (c) Content of Regulations.

(1) In general .

The regulations required by subsection (b) shall provide that each individual purchase of property or services in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold that is made under a multiple award contract shall be made on a competitive basis unless a contracting officer

(A) waives the requirement on the basis of a determination that

(i) one of the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 4106(c) of this title or section 3406(c) of title 10 applies to the individual purchase; or

(ii) a law expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a specified source; and

(B) justifies the determination in writing.

(2) Competitive basis procedures .

For purposes of this subsection, an individual purchase of property or services is made on a competitive basis only if it is made pursuant to procedures that

(A) require fair notice of the intent to make that purchase (including a description of the work to be performed and the basis on which the selection will be made) to be provided to all contractors offering the property or services under the multiple award contract; and

(B) afford all contractors responding to the notice a fair opportunity to make an offer and have that offer fairly considered by the official making the purchase.

(3) Exception to notice requirement.

(A) In general .

Notwithstanding paragraph (2), and subject to subparagraph (B), notice may be provided to fewer than all contractors offering the property or services under a multiple award contract as described in subsection (a)(3)(A) if notice is provided to as many contractors as practicable.

(B) Limitation on exception .

A purchase may not be made pursuant to a notice that is provided to fewer than all contractors under subparagraph (A) unless

(i) offers were received from at least 3 qualified contractors; or

(ii) a contracting officer of the executive agency determines in writing that no additional qualified contractors were able to be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so.
