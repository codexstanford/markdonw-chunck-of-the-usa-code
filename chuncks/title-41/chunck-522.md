#### § 4706. Examination of facilities and records of contractor
###### (d) Authority of Comptroller General.

(1) In general .

Except as provided in paragraph (2), each contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed bid procedures shall provide that the Comptroller General and representatives of the Comptroller General may examine records of the contractor, or any of its subcontractors, that directly pertain to, and involve transactions relating to, the contract or subcontract and to interview any current employee regarding the transactions.

(2) Exception for foreign contractor or subcontractor .

Paragraph (1) does not apply to a contract or subcontract with a foreign contractor or foreign subcontractor if the executive agency concerned determines, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General or the designee of the Comptroller General, that applying paragraph (1) to the contract or subcontract would not be in the public interest. The concurrence of the Comptroller General or the designee is not required when

(A) the contractor or subcontractor is

(i) the government of a foreign country or an agency of that government; or

(ii) precluded by the laws of the country involved from making its records available for examination; and

(B) the executive agency determines, after taking into account the price and availability of the property and services from United States sources, that the public interest would be best served by not applying paragraph (1).

(3) Additional records not required .

Paragraph (1) does not require a contractor or subcontractor to create or maintain a record that the contractor or subcontractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to another law.
