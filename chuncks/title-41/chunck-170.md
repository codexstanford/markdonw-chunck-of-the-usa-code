(3) Objections to public-private competition.

(A) Grounds .

A representative individual or entity at a facility where a public-private competition is conducted may submit to the head of the executive agency an objection to the public-private competition on the grounds that

(ii) the certification required by paragraph (1)(E) was not included in the report required by paragraph (1).

(B) Deadlines .

The objection shall be in writing and shall be submitted within 90 days after the following date:

(C) Report and certification required before solicitation or award of contract .

If the head of the executive agency determines that the report required by paragraph (1) was not submitted or that the required certification was not included in the submitted report, the function for which the public-private competition was conducted for which the objection was submitted may not be the subject of a solicitation of offers for, or award of, a contract until, respectively, the report is submitted or a report containing the certification in full compliance with the certification requirement is submitted.
