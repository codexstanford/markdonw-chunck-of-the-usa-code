(1) Determining whether proposals are necessary .

In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system’s required capabilities.

Proposals submitted in response to this requirement may include the following:

(A) Proposals to provide to the Federal Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the data and the right to use the data.
