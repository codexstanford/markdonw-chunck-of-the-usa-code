###### (b) Inclusion in Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(1) In general .

The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include a list of provisions of law that are inapplicable to contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold. A provision of law properly included on the list pursuant to paragraph (2) does not apply to contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold that are made by an executive agency. This section does not render a provision of law not included on the list inapplicable to contracts and subcontracts in amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.

(2) Laws enacted after october 13, 1994 .

A provision of law described in subsection (c) that is enacted after October 13, 1994 , shall be included on the list of inapplicable provisions of laws required by paragraph (1) unless the Council makes a written determination that it would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold from the applicability of the provision.
