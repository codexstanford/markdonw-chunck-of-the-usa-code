(B) the justification is approved, in the case of a contract for an amount

(i) exceeding $500,000 but equal to or less than $10,000,000, by the advocate for competition for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii);

(ii) exceeding $10,000,000 but equal to or less than $50,000,000, by the head of the procuring activity or by a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in which the individual is entitled to receive the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or

(iii) exceeding $50,000,000, by the senior procurement executive of the agency designated pursuant to section 1702(c) of this title (without further delegation); and

(C) any required notice has been published with respect to the contract pursuant to section 1708 of this title and the executive agency has considered all bids or proposals received in response to that notice.

(2) Elements of justification .

The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) shall include

(C) a determination that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable;

(D) a description of the market survey conducted or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted;

(E) a listing of any sources that expressed in writing an interest in the procurement; and

(F) a statement of any actions the agency may take to remove or overcome a barrier to competition before a subsequent procurement for those needs.

(3) Justification allowed after contract awarded .

In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (a)(2), the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be made after the contract is awarded.

(C) the procurement is permitted by subsection (a)(7); or

(D) the procurement is conducted under chapter 85 of this title or section 8(a) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637(a) ).

(5) Restrictions on executive agencies.

(A) Contracts and procurement of property or services .

In no case may an executive agency

(i) enter into a contract for property or services using procedures other than competitive procedures on the basis of the lack of advance planning or concerns related to the amount available to the agency for procurement functions; or

(ii) procure property or services from another executive agency unless the other executive agency complies fully with the requirements of this division in its procurement of the property or services.

(B) Additional restriction .

The restriction set out in subparagraph (A)(ii) is in addition to any other restriction provided by law.
