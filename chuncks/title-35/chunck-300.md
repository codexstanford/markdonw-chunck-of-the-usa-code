### CHAPTER 32— POST-GRANT REVIEW
#### § 325. Relation to other proceedings or actions
###### (f) Reissue Patents .

A post-grant review may not be instituted under this chapter if the petition requests cancellation of a claim in a reissue patent that is identical to or narrower than a claim in the original patent from which the reissue patent was issued, and the time limitations in section 321(c) would bar filing a petition for a post-grant review for such original patent.
