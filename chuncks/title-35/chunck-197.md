(B) Patent enforcement actions .

In an action brought under section 337(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 ( 19 U.S.C. 1337(a) ), or section 281, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any defense raised in the action that is based upon information that was considered, reconsidered, or corrected pursuant to a supplemental examination request under subsection (a), unless the supplemental examination, and any reexamination ordered pursuant to the request, are concluded before the date on which the action is brought.
