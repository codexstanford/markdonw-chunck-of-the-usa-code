### CHAPTER 1— ESTABLISHMENT, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES, FUNCTIONS
#### § 6. Patent Trial and Appeal Board
###### (d) Treatment of Prior Appointments .

The Secretary of Commerce may, in the Secretary’s discretion, deem the appointment of an administrative patent judge who, before the date of the enactment of this subsection, held office pursuant to an appointment by the Director to take effect on the date on which the Director initially appointed the administrative patent judge. It shall be a defense to a challenge to the appointment of an administrative patent judge on the basis of the judge’s having been originally appointed by the Director that the administrative patent judge so appointed was acting as a de facto officer.
