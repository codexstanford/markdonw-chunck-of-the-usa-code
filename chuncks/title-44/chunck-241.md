#### § 2208. Claims of constitutionally based privilege against disclosure
######## (B) If the incumbent President upholds the claim of privilege asserted by the former President, the Archivist shall not make the Presidential record (or reasonably segregable part of a record) subject to the claim publicly available unless

(i) the incumbent President withdraws the decision upholding the claim of privilege asserted by the former President; or

(ii) the Archivist is otherwise directed by a final court order that is not subject to appeal.

(C) If the incumbent President determines not to uphold the claim of privilege asserted by the former President, or fails to make the determination under paragraph (1) before the end of the period specified in subparagraph (A), the Archivist shall release the Presidential record subject to the claim at the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date on which the Archivist received notification of the claim, unless otherwise directed by a court order in an action initiated by the former President under section 2204(e) of this title or by a court order in another action in any Federal court.
