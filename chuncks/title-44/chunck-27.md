#### § 504. Direct purchase of printing, binding, and blank-book work by Government agencies

The Joint Committee on Printing may permit the Director of the Government Publishing Office to authorize an executive department, independent office, or establishment of the Government to purchase direct for its use such printing, binding, and blank-book work, otherwise authorized by law, as the Government Publishing Office is not able or suitably equipped to execute or as may be more economically or in the better interest of the Government executed elsewhere.
