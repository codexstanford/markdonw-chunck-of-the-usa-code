###### (c) Civil Penalty Procedure.

(1) In general .

Whenever a civil penalty is sought for a violation of this section or of section 304, the charged party is entitled to receive a formal complaint specifying the charges and, at his or her request, to contest the charges in a hearing before an administrative law judge. Any such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code.

(2) Commencement of civil actions .

If any person fails to pay a civil penalty imposed under this chapter, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to recover the amount imposed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final order). No such action may be commenced more than 5 years after the date the order imposing the civil penalty becomes final. In such action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.

(3) Remission or mitigation of penalties .

The Secretary may remit or mitigate any penalties imposed under paragraph (1) if, in the Secretary’s opinion

(A) the penalties were incurred without willful negligence or fraud; or

(B) other circumstances exist that justify a remission or mitigation.

(4) Applicable law for delegated functions .

If, pursuant to section 306, the Secretary delegates functions under this section to another agency, the provisions of law of that agency relating to penalty assessment, remission or mitigation of such penalties, collection of such penalties, and limitations of actions and compromise of claims, shall apply.

(5) Deposit of payments in general fund of the treasury .

Any amount paid in satisfaction of a civil penalty imposed under this section or section 304 shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury and credited as miscellaneous receipts.
