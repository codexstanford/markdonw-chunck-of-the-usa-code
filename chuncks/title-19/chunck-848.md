#### § 1673d. Final determinations
##### (b) Final determination by Commission

(1) In general

The Commission shall make a final determination of whether

(A) an industry in the United States

(i) is materially injured, or

(ii) is threatened with material injury, or

(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a)(1). If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.

(2) Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority

If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title is affirmative, then the Commission shall make the determination required by paragraph (1) before the later of

(A) the 120th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title , or

(B) the 45th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative final determination under subsection (a).

(3) Period for injury determination following negative preliminary determination by administering authority

If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title is negative, and its final determination under subsection (a) is affirmative, then the final determination by the Commission under this subsection shall be made within 75 days after the date of that affirmative final determination.

(4) Certain additional findings

(A) Commission standard for retroactive application.

(i) In general .

If the finding of the administering authority under subsection (a)(3) is affirmative, then the final determination of the Commission shall include a finding as to whether the imports subject to the affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3) are likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the antidumping duty order to be issued under section 1673e of this title .

(ii) Factors to consider .

In making the evaluation under clause (i), the Commission shall consider, among other factors it considers relevant

(I) the timing and the volume of the imports,

(II) a rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and

(III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the antidumping order will be seriously undermined.

(B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of the imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise.
