(1) In general

For purposes of this Act and for purposes of implementing the preferential tariff treatment provided for under the USMCA, except as otherwise provided in this section, a good is an originating good if

(A) the good is a good wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries;

(B) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries using nonoriginating materials, if the good satisfies all applicable requirements set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA; or

(C) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries, exclusively from originating materials;

(D) except for a good provided for under any of chapters 61 through 63

(i) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more USMCA countries;

(ii) one or more of the nonoriginating materials provided for as parts under the HTS and used in the production of the good do not satisfy the requirements set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA because

(I) both the good and its materials are classified under the same subheading or under the same heading that is not further subdivided into subheadings; or

(II) the good was imported into the territory of a USMCA country in an unassembled form or a disassembled form but was classified as an assembled good pursuant to rule 2(a) of the General Rules of Interpretation of the HTS; and

(iii) the regional value content of the good is not less than 60 percent if the transaction value method is used, or not less than 50 percent if the net cost method is used and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this section; or

(E) the good itself, as imported, is listed in table 2.10.1 of the USMCA and is imported into the territory of the United States from the territory of a USMCA country.

(2) Remanufactured goods

For purposes of determining whether a remanufactured good is an originating good, a recovered material derived in the territory of one or more USMCA countries shall be treated as originating if the recovered material is used or consumed in the production of, and incorporated into, the remanufactured good.

(3) Special rule for foreign-trade zones

Paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to a good produced in a foreign-trade zone or subzone established pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the “Foreign Trade Zones Act”) ( 19 U.S.C. 81a et seq.) that is entered for consumption in the customs territory of the United States.
