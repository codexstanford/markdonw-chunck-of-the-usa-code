Each person granted a customs broker’s license under subsection (b) shall be issued, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, either or both of the following:

(A) A national permit for the conduct of such customs business as the Secretary prescribes by regulation.

(B) A permit for each customs district in which that person conducts customs business and, except as provided in paragraph (2), regularly employs at least 1 individual who is licensed under subsection (b)(2) to exercise responsible supervision and control over the customs business conducted by that person in that district.

(2) Exception

If a person granted a customs broker’s license under subsection (b) can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that

(A) he regularly employs in the region in which that district is located at least one individual who is licensed under subsection (b)(2), and

(B) that sufficient procedures exist within the company for the person employed in that region to exercise responsible supervision and control over the customs business conducted by that person in that district, the Secretary may waive the requirement in paragraph (1)(B).

(3) Lapse of permit

The failure of a customs broker granted a permit under paragraph (1) to employ, for any continuous period of 180 days, at least one individual who is licensed under subsection (b)(2) within the district or region (if paragraph (2) applies) for which a permit was issued shall, in addition to causing the broker to be subject to any other sanction under this section (including any in subsection (d)), result in the revocation by operation of law of the permit.

(4) Appointment of subagents

Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1), upon the implementation by the Secretary under section 1413(b)(2) of this title of the component of the National Customs Automation Program referred to in section 1411(a)(2)(B) of this title , a licensed broker may appoint another licensed broker holding a permit in a customs district to act on its behalf as its subagent in that district if such activity relates to the filing of information that is permitted by law or regulation to be filed electronically. A licensed broker appointing a subagent pursuant to this paragraph shall remain liable for any and all obligations arising under bond and any and all duties, taxes, and fees, as well as any other liabilities imposed by law, and shall be precluded from delegating to a subagent such liability.
