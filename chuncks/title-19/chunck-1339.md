#### § 2293. Limitations on trade readjustment allowances
##### (c) Special adjustments for benefit years ending with extended benefit periods

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or other Federal law, if the benefit year of a worker ends within an extended benefit period, the number of weeks of extended benefits that such worker would, but for this subsection, be entitled to in that extended benefit period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the number of weeks for which the worker was entitled, during such benefit year, to trade readjustment allowances under this division. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms “benefit year” and “extended benefit period” shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.
