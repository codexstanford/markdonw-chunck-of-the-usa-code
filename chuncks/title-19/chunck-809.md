#### § 1671d. Final determinations
##### (a) Final determination by administering authority

(1) In general

Within 75 days after the date of the preliminary determination under section 1671b(b) of this title , the administering authority shall make a final determination of whether or not a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise; except that when an investigation under this part is initiated simultaneously with an investigation under part II of this subtitle, which involves imports of the same class or kind of merchandise from the same or other countries, the administering authority, if requested by the petitioner, shall extend the date of the final determination under this paragraph to the date of the final determination of the administering authority in such investigation initiated under part II of this subtitle.

(2) Critical circumstances determinations

If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under section 1671b(e) of this title , shall also contain a finding as to whether

(A) the countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, and

(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period. Such findings may be affirmative even though the preliminary determination under section 1671b(e)(1) of this title was negative.

(3) De minimis countervailable subsidy

In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any countervailable subsidy that is de minimis as defined in section 1671b(b)(4) of this title .
