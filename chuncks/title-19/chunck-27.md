#### § 58c. Fees for certain customs services
##### (f) Disposition of fees

(1) There is established in the general fund of the Treasury a separate account which shall be known as the “Customs User Fee Account”. Notwithstanding section 1524 of this title , there shall be deposited as offsetting receipts into the Customs User Fee Account all fees collected under subsection (a) except

(A) the portion of such fees that is required under paragraph (3) for the direct reimbursement of appropriations, and

(B) amounts deposited into the Customs Commercial and Homeland Security Automation Account under paragraph (4).

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all funds in the Customs User Fee Account shall be available, to the extent provided for in appropriations Acts, to pay the costs (other than costs for which direct reimbursement under paragraph (3) is required) incurred by the United States Customs Service in conducting customs revenue functions as defined in section 215 of title 6 (other than functions performed by the Office of International Affairs referred to in section 215(8) of title 6 ), and for automation (including the Automation Commercial Environment computer system), and for no other purpose. To the extent that funds in the Customs User Fee Account are insufficient to pay the costs of such customs revenue functions, customs duties in an amount equal to the amount of such insufficiency shall be available, to the extent provided for in appropriations Acts, to pay the costs of such customs revenue functions in the amount of such insufficiency, and shall be available for no other purpose. The provisions of the first and second sentences of this paragraph specifying the purposes for which amounts in the Customs User Fee Account may be made available shall not be superseded except by a provision of law which specifically modifies or supersedes such provisions. So long as there is a surplus of funds in the Customs User Fee Account, the Secretary of the Treasury may not reduce personnel staffing levels for providing commercial clearance and preclearance services.
