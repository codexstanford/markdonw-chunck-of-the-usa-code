(F) the final rule or other modification has been published in the Federal Register.

(2) Effective date of modification

A final rule or other modification to which paragraph (1) applies may not go into effect before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which consultations under paragraph (1)(E) begin, unless the President determines that an earlier effective date is in the national interest.
