## SUBTITLE VI— SOFTWOOD LUMBER
### CHAPTER 12— TRADE ACT OF 1974
#### § 2466a. Designation of sub-Saharan African countries for certain benefits
##### (c) Withdrawal, suspension, or limitation of preferential tariff treatment

(1) In general

The President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment provided for any article described in subsection (b)(1) of this section or section 112 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act [ 19 U.S.C. 3721 ] with respect to a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if the President determines that withdrawing, suspending, or limiting such duty-free treatment would be more effective in promoting compliance by the country with the requirements described in subsection (a)(1) than terminating the designation of the country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of this section.

(2) Notification

The President may not withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under paragraph (1) unless, at least 60 days before such withdrawal, suspension, or limitation, the President notifies Congress and notifies the country of the President’s intention to withdraw, suspend, or limit such duty-free treatment, together with the considerations entering into the decision to terminate such designation.
