(1) In general

For purposes of determining whether merchandise developed after an investigation is initiated under this subtitle or section 1303  1 of this title (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the “later-developed merchandise”) is within the scope of an outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty order issued under this subtitle or section 1303  1 of this title as a result of such investigation, the administering authority shall consider whether

(A) the later-developed merchandise has the same general physical characteristics as the merchandise with respect to which the order was originally issued (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the “earlier product”),

(B) the expectations of the ultimate purchasers of the later-developed merchandise are the same as for the earlier product,

(C) the ultimate use of the earlier product and the later-developed merchandise are the same,

(D) the later-developed merchandise is sold through the same channels of trade as the earlier product, and

(E) the later-developed merchandise is advertised and displayed in a manner similar to the earlier product. The administering authority shall take into account any advice provided by the Commission under subsection (e) before making a determination under this subparagraph.

(2) Exclusion from orders

The administering authority may not exclude a later-developed merchandise from a countervailing or antidumping duty order merely because the merchandise

(A) is classified under a tariff classification other than that identified in the petition or the administering authority’s prior notices during the proceeding, or

(B) permits the purchaser to perform additional functions, unless such additional functions constitute the primary use of the merchandise and the cost of the additional functions constitute more than a significant proportion of the total cost of production of the merchandise.
