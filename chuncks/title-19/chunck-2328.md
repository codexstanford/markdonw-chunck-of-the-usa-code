#### § 4403. Honey transshipment
##### (d) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs should promptly establish a national standard of identity for honey for the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to use to ensure that imports of honey are

(1) classified accurately for purposes of assessing duties; and

(2) denied entry into the United States if such imports pose a threat to the health or safety of consumers in the United States.
