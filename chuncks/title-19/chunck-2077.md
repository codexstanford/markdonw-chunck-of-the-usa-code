#### § 3805. Implementation of trade agreements
##### (a) In general

(1) Notification and submission

Any agreement entered into under section 3803(b) of this title shall enter into force with respect to the United States if (and only if)

(B) within 60 days after entering into the agreement, the President submits to the Congress a description of those changes to existing laws that the President considers would be required in order to bring the United States into compliance with the agreement;

(C) after entering into the agreement, the President submits to the Congress, on a day on which both Houses of Congress are in session, a copy of the final legal text of the agreement, together with

(i) a draft of an implementing bill described in section 3803(b)(3) of this title ;

(ii) a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement the trade agreement; and

(iii) the supporting information described in paragraph (2); and

(D) the implementing bill is enacted into law.

(2) Supporting information

The supporting information required under paragraph (1)(C)(iii) consists of

(A) an explanation as to how the implementing bill and proposed administrative action will change or affect existing law; and

(B) a statement

(i) asserting that the agreement makes progress in achieving the applicable purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter; and

(ii) setting forth the reasons of the President regarding

(I) how and to what extent the agreement makes progress in achieving the applicable purposes, policies, and objectives referred to in clause (i);

In order to ensure that a foreign country that is not a party to a trade agreement entered into under section 3803(b) of this title does not receive benefits under the agreement unless the country is also subject to the obligations under the agreement, the implementing bill submitted with respect to the agreement shall provide that the benefits and obligations under the agreement apply only to the parties to the agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of the agreement. The implementing bill may also provide that the benefits and obligations under the agreement do not apply uniformly to all parties to the agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of the agreement.

(4) Disclosure of commitments

Any agreement or other understanding with a foreign government or governments (whether oral or in writing) that

(A) relates to a trade agreement with respect to which the Congress enacts an implementing bill under trade authorities procedures, and

(B) is not disclosed to the Congress before an implementing bill with respect to that agreement is introduced in either House of Congress, shall not be considered to be part of the agreement approved by the Congress and shall have no force and effect under United States law or in any dispute settlement body.
