#### § 3106. Review of trade agreement implementation by Trade Representative
##### (c) Action in response to affirmative determination

(1) Any affirmative determination made by the Trade Representative under subsection (a)(2) with respect to any act, policy, or practice of a foreign country shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974 [ 19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.], be treated as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of such Act [ 19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A) ] that such act, policy, or practice violates a trade agreement.

(2) In taking actions under section 301 [ 19 U.S.C. 2411 ] by reason of paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall first take those actions which most directly affect trade in telecommunications products and services with the priority foreign country referred to in paragraph (1), unless the Trade Representative determines that actions against other economic sectors would be more effective in achieving compliance by the foreign country with the trade agreement that is the subject of the affirmative determination made under subsection (a)(2).
