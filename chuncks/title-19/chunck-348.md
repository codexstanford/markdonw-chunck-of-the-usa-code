The ITDS shall be implemented not later than the date that the Automated Commercial Environment (commonly referred to as “ACE”) is fully implemented.

(B) Purpose

The purpose of the ITDS is to eliminate redundant information requirements, to efficiently regulate the flow of commerce, and to effectively enforce laws and regulations relating to international trade, by establishing a single portal system, operated by the United States Customs and Border Protection, for the collection and distribution of standard electronic import and export data required by all participating Federal agencies.

(C) Participation

(i) In general

All Federal agencies that require documentation for clearing or licensing the importation and exportation of cargo shall participate in the ITDS.

(ii) Waiver

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may waive, in whole or in part, the requirement for participation for any Federal agency based on the vital national interest of the United States.

(D) Consultation

The Secretary shall consult with and assist the United States Customs and Border Protection and other agencies in the transition from paper to electronic format for the submission, issuance, and storage of documents relating to data required to enter cargo into the United States. In so doing, the Secretary shall also consult with private sector stakeholders, including the Commercial Operations Advisory Committee, in developing uniform data submission requirements, procedures, and schedules, for the ITDS.

(E) Coordination

The Secretary shall be responsible for coordinating the operation of the ITDS among the participating agencies and the office within the United States Customs and Border Protection that is responsible for maintaining the ITDS.

(2) Data elements

(A) In general

The Interagency Steering Committee (established under paragraph (3)) shall, in consultation with the agencies participating in the ITDS, define the standard set of data elements to be collected, stored, and shared in the ITDS, consistent with laws applicable to the collection and protection of import and export information. The Interagency Steering Committee shall periodically review the data elements in order to update the standard set of data elements, as necessary.

(B) Commitments and obligations

The Interagency Steering Committee shall ensure that the ITDS data requirements are compatible with the commitments and obligations of the United States as a member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) for the entry and movement of cargo.

(3) Interagency Steering Committee

There is established an Interagency Steering Committee (in this section, referred to as the “Committee”). The members of the Committee shall include the Secretary (who shall serve as the chairperson of the Committee), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the head of each agency participating in the ITDS. The Committee shall assist the Secretary in overseeing the implementation of, and participation in, the ITDS.

(4) Information technology infrastructure

(A) In general

The Secretary shall work with the head of each agency participating in the ITDS and the Interagency Steering Committee to ensure that each agency

(i) develops and maintains the necessary information technology infrastructure to support the operation of the ITDS and to submit all data to the ITDS electronically;

(ii) enters into a memorandum of understanding, or takes such other action as is necessary, to provide for the information sharing between the agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection necessary for the operation and maintenance of the ITDS;

(iv) not later than December 31, 2016 , utilizes the ITDS as the primary means of receiving from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation, exclusive of applications for permits, licenses, or certifications required for the release of imported cargo and clearance of cargo for export.

(B) Rule of construction

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require any action to be taken that would compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation or would compromise national security.

(7) Construction

Nothing in this section shall be construed as amending or modifying subsection (g) of section 301 of title 13 .
