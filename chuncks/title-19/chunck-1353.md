##### (a) In general
######## (A) The Secretary is not required under paragraph (1) to pay the costs of any training approved under paragraph (1) to the extent that such costs are paid

(i) under any Federal or State program other than this part, or

(ii) from any source other than this section.

(B) Before approving any training to which subparagraph (A) may apply, the Secretary may require that the adversely affected worker or adversely affected incumbent worker enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the Secretary will not be required to pay under this section the portion of the costs of such training that the worker has reason to believe will be paid under the program, or by the source, described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A).

(7) The Secretary shall not approve a training program if

(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,

(B) the adversely affected worker or adversely affected incumbent worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and

(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under this part, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program.

(8) The Secretary may approve training for any adversely affected worker who is a member of a group certified under subpart A of this part at any time after the date on which the group is certified under subpart A of this part, without regard to whether such worker has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance to which the worker is entitled.

(9)

(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which set forth the criteria under each of the subparagraphs of paragraph (1) that will be used as the basis for making determinations under paragraph (1).

(B)

(i) In determining under paragraph (1)(E) whether a worker is qualified to undertake and complete training, the Secretary may approve training for a period longer than the worker’s period of eligibility for trade readjustment allowances under division I if the worker demonstrates a financial ability to complete the training after the expiration of the worker’s period of eligibility for such trade readjustment allowances.

(ii) In determining the reasonable cost of training under paragraph (1)(F) with respect to a worker, the Secretary may consider whether other public or private funds are reasonably available to the worker, except that the Secretary may not require a worker to obtain such funds as a condition of approval of training under paragraph (1).

(10) In the case of an adversely affected incumbent worker, the Secretary may not approve

(A) on-the-job training under paragraph (5)(A)(i); or

(B) customized training under paragraph (5)(A)(ii), unless such training is for a position other than the worker’s adversely affected employment.
