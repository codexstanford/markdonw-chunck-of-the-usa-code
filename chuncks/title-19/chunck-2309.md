(C) Application

An inference described in subparagraph (A) may be used under that subparagraph with respect to a person described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (B) without regard to whether another person involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by the Secretary, such as import or export documentation.

(A) the allegation of evasion of the trade remedy laws, if any, submitted to U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
