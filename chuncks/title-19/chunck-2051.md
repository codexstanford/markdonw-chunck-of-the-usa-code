### CHAPTER 23— EXTENSION OF CERTAIN TRADE BENEFITS TO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
#### § 3737. Additional authorities and increased flexibility to provide assistance under the Development Fund for Africa
##### (a) Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth

It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment. Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.
