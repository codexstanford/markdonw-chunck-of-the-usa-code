(C) Motor vehicles

(i) Basis of calculation

For purposes of determining the regional value-content under subparagraph (A) for an automotive good that is a motor vehicle provided for in any of headings 8701 through 8705, an importer, exporter, or producer may average the amounts calculated under the formula contained in subparagraph (A), over the producer’s fiscal year

(II) with respect to all motor vehicles in any such category that are exported to the territory of one or more of the CAFTA–DR countries.

(ii) Categories

A category is described in this clause if it

(I) is the same model line of motor vehicles, is in the same class of vehicles, and is produced in the same plant in the territory of a CAFTA–DR country, as the good described in clause (i) for which regional value-content is being calculated;

(II) is the same class of motor vehicles, and is produced in the same plant in the territory of a CAFTA–DR country, as the good described in clause (i) for which regional value-content is being calculated; or

(III) is the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of a CAFTA–DR country as the good described in clause (i) for which regional value-content is being calculated.

(D) Other automotive goods

For purposes of determining the regional value-content under subparagraph (A) for automotive goods provided for in any of subheadings 8407.31 through 8407.34, in subheading 8408.20, or in heading 8409, 8706, 8707, or 8708, that are produced in the same plant, an importer, exporter, or producer may

(i) average the amounts calculated under the formula contained in subparagraph (A) over

(I) the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer to whom the automotive goods are sold,

(II) any quarter or month, or

(III) its own fiscal year,  if the goods were produced during the fiscal year, quarter, or month that is the basis for the calculation;

(ii) determine the average referred to in clause (i) separately for such goods sold to 1 or more motor vehicle producers; or

(iii) make a separate determination under clause (i) or (ii) for automotive goods that are exported to the territory of one or more of the CAFTA–DR countries.

(E) Calculating net cost

The importer, exporter, or producer shall, consistent with the provisions regarding allocation of costs set out in generally accepted accounting principles, determine the net cost of an automotive good under subparagraph (B) by

(i) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer of the automotive good, subtracting any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of all such goods, and then reasonably allocating the resulting net cost of those goods to the automotive good;

(ii) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating the total cost to the automotive good, and then subtracting any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the automotive good; or

(iii) reasonably allocating each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the automotive good so that the aggregate of all such costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, or nonallowable interest costs.
