##### (c) Determinations

(1) Determination of evasion

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), not later than 300 calendar days after the date on which the Commissioner initiates an investigation under subsection (b) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner shall make a determination, based on substantial evidence, with respect to whether such covered merchandise was entered into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.

(B) Additional time

The Commissioner may extend the time to make a determination under subparagraph (A) by not more than 60 calendar days if the Commissioner determines that

(i) the investigation is extraordinarily complicated because of

(I) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated;

(II) the novelty of the issues presented; or

(III) the number of entities to be investigated; and

(ii) additional time is necessary to make the determination under subparagraph (A).

(2) Authority to collect and verify additional information

In making a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner may collect such additional information as is necessary to make the determination through such methods as the Commissioner considers appropriate, including by

(A) issuing a questionnaire with respect to such covered merchandise to

(i) an interested party that filed an allegation under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) that resulted in the initiation of an investigation under paragraph (1) of that subsection with respect to such covered merchandise;

(ii) a person alleged to have entered such covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion;

(iii) a person that is a foreign producer or exporter of such covered merchandise; or

(iv) the government of a country from which such covered merchandise was exported; and

(B) conducting verifications, including on-site verifications, of any relevant information.

(3) Adverse inference

(A) In general

If the Commissioner finds that a party or person described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A) has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of the party or person’s ability to comply with a request for information, the Commissioner may, in making a determination under paragraph (1), use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party or person in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination.

(B) Application

An inference described in subparagraph (A) may be used under that subparagraph with respect to a person described in clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (2)(A) without regard to whether another person involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by the Commissioner, such as import or export documentation.

(C) Adverse inference described

An adverse inference used under subparagraph (A) may include reliance on information derived from

(i) the allegation of evasion of the trade remedy laws, if any, submitted to U.S. Customs and Border Protection;

(ii) a determination by the Commissioner in another investigation, proceeding, or other action regarding evasion of the unfair trade laws; or

(iii) any other available information.

(4) Notification

Not later than 5 business days after making a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the Commissioner

(A) shall provide to each interested party that filed an allegation under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) that resulted in the initiation of an investigation under paragraph (1) of that subsection with respect to such covered merchandise a notification of the determination and may, in addition, include an explanation of the basis for the determination; and

(B) may provide to importers, in such manner as the Commissioner determines appropriate, information discovered in the investigation that the Commissioner determines will help educate importers with respect to importing merchandise into the customs territory of the United States in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
