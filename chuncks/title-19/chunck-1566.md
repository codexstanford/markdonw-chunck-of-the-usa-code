#### § 2463. Designation of eligible articles
##### (d) Waiver of competitive need limitation

(1) In general

The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) with respect to any eligible article of any beneficiary developing country if, before November 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2)(A) was made with respect to such eligible article, the President

(A) receives the advice of the International Trade Commission under section 1332 of this title on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by such waiver,

(B) determines, based on the considerations described in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title and the advice described in subparagraph (A), that such waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States, and

(C) publishes the determination described in subparagraph (B) in the Federal Register.

(2) Considerations by the President

In making any determination under paragraph (1), the President shall give great weight to

(A) the extent to which the beneficiary developing country has assured the United States that such country will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets and basic commodity resources of such country, and

(B) the extent to which such country provides adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.

(3) Other bases for waiver

The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) if, before November 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2) was made with respect to a beneficiary developing country, the President determines that

(A) there has been a historical preferential trade relationship between the United States and such country,

(B) there is a treaty or trade agreement in force covering economic relations between such country and the United States, and

(C) such country does not discriminate against, or impose unjustifiable or unreasonable barriers to, United States commerce, and the President publishes that determination in the Federal Register.

(4) Limitations on waivers

(A) In general

The President may not exercise the waiver authority under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which equals or exceeds 30 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year.

(B) Other waiver limits

(i) The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which exceeds 15 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that have entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year from those beneficiary developing countries which for the preceding calendar year

(I) had a per capita gross national product (calculated on the basis of the best available information, including that of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) of $5,000 or more; or

(II) had exported (either directly or indirectly) to the United States a quantity of articles that was duty-free under this subchapter that had an aggregate appraised value of more than 10 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during that year.

(ii) Not later than November 1 of each year, the President should revoke any waiver that has then been in effect with respect to an article for 5 years or more if the beneficiary developing country has exported to the United States (directly or indirectly) during the preceding calendar year a quantity of the article

(I) having an appraised value in excess of 1.5 times the applicable amount set forth in subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) for that calendar year; or

(II) exceeding 75 percent of the appraised value of the total imports of that article into the United States during that calendar year.

(C) Calculation of limitations

There shall be counted against the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for any calendar year only that value of any eligible article of any country that

(i) entered duty-free under this subchapter during such calendar year; and

(ii) is in excess of the value of that article that would have been so entered during such calendar year if the limitations under subsection (c)(2)(A) applied.

(5) Effective period of waiver

Any waiver granted under this subsection shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.
