#### § 3555. Objectives for extended negotiations
##### (a) Trade in financial services

The principal negotiating objective of the United States in the extended negotiations on financial services to be conducted under the auspices of the WTO is to seek to secure commitments, from a wide range of commercially important developed and developing countries, to reduce or eliminate barriers to the supply of financial services, including barriers that deny national treatment or market access by restricting the establishment or operation of financial services providers, as the condition for the United States

(1) offering commitments to provide national treatment and market access in each of the financial services subsectors, and

(2) making such commitments on a normal trade relations basis.
