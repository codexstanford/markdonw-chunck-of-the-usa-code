### CHAPTER 19— TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRADE
#### § 3105. Actions to be taken if no agreement obtained
##### (a) In general

(1) If the President is unable, before the close of the negotiating period, to enter into an agreement under subtitle A with any priority foreign country identified under section 3103 of this title which achieves the general negotiating objectives described in section 3104(b) of this title as defined by the specific objectives established by the President for that country, the President shall take whatever actions authorized under subsection (b) that are appropriate and most likely to achieve such general negotiating objectives.

(2) In taking actions under paragraph (1), the President shall first take those actions which most directly affect trade in telecommunications products and services with the priority foreign country referred to in paragraph (1), unless the President determines that actions against other economic sectors would be more effective in achieving the general negotiating objectives referred to in paragraph (1).
