### CHAPTER 18— IMPLEMENTATION OF HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE
#### § 3011. Transition to Harmonized Tariff Schedule
##### (d) Certain protests and petitions under customs law
######## (B) At the earliest practicable date after January 1, 1989 , the Commission shall initiate an investigation under section 1332 of this title of those final judicial decisions referred to in subparagraph (A) that

(i) are published during the 2-year period beginning on February 1, 1988 ; and

(ii) would have affected tariff treatment if they had been published during the period of the conversion of the old Schedules into the format of the Convention. No later than September 1, 1990 , the Commission shall report the results of the investigation to the President, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee on Finance, and shall recommend those changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule that the Commission would have recommended if the final decisions concerned had been made before the conversion into the format of the Convention occurred.

(3) The President shall review all changes recommended by the Commission under paragraph (2)(B) and shall, as soon as practicable, proclaim such of those changes, if any, which he decides are necessary or appropriate to conform such Schedule to the final judicial decisions. Any such change shall be effective with respect to

(A) entries made on or after the date of such proclamation; and

(B) entries made on or after January 1, 1989 , if, notwithstanding section 1514 of this title , application for liquidation or reliquidation thereof is made by the importer to the customs officer concerned within 180 days after the effective date of such proclamation.

(4) If any protest or petition referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is not sustained in whole or in part by a final judicial decision, the entries subject to that petition or protest and made before January 1, 1989 , shall be liquidated or reliquidated, as appropriate, in accordance with the final judicial decision under the old Schedules.
