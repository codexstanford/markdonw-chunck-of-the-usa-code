A person who has served as a commissioner for more than 5 years (excluding service as a commissioner before January 3, 1975 ) shall not be eligible for reappointment as a commissioner. Not more than three of the commissioners shall be members of the same political party, and in making appointments members of different political parties shall be appointed alternately as nearly as may be practicable.
