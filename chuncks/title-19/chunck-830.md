#### § 1673b. Preliminary determinations
##### (c) Extension of period in extraordinarily complicated cases

(1) In general

If

(A) the petitioner makes a timely request for an extension of the period within which the determination must be made under subsection (b)(1), or

(B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that

(i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of

(I) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,

(II) the novelty of the issues presented, or

(III) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated, and

(ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination, then the administering authority may postpone making the preliminary determination under subsection (b)(1) until not later than the 190th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1673a(c) of this title , or an investigation is initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title . No extension of a determination date may be made under this paragraph for any investigation in which a determination date provided for in subsection (b)(1)(B) applies unless the petitioner submits written notice to the administering authority of its consent to the extension.

(2) Notice of postponement

The administering authority shall notify the parties to the investigation, not later than 20 days before the date on which the preliminary determination would otherwise be required under subsection (b)(1), if it intends to postpone making the preliminary determination under paragraph (1). The notification shall include an explanation of the reasons for the postponement, and notice of the postponement shall be published in the Federal Register.
