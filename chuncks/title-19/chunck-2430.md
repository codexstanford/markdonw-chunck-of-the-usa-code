### CHAPTER 29— UNITED STATES–MEXICO–CANADA AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
#### § 4551. USMCA article impact in import relief cases under Trade Act of 1974
##### (b) Factors

(1) Substantial import share

In determining whether imports from a USMCA country, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports, such imports normally shall not be considered to account for a substantial share of total imports if that country is not among the top 5 suppliers of the article subject to the investigation, measured in terms of import share during the most recent 3-year period.

(2) Application of “contribute importantly” standard

In determining whether imports from a USMCA country or countries contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the International Trade Commission shall consider such factors as the change in the import share of the USMCA country or countries, and the level and change in the level of imports of such country or countries. In applying the preceding sentence, imports from a USMCA country or countries normally shall not be considered to contribute importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, if the growth rate of imports from such country or countries during the period in which an injurious increase in imports occurred is appreciably lower than the growth rate of total imports from all sources over the same period.
