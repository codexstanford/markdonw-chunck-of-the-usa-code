## SUBTITLE IV— COUNTERVAILING AND ANTIDUMPING DUTIES
#### § 1675a. Special rules for section 1675(b) and 1675(c) reviews
##### (b) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy

(1) In general

In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title , the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1671c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy. The administering authority shall consider

(A) the net countervailable subsidy determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and

(B) whether any change in the program which gave rise to the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable subsidy.

(2) Consideration of other factors

If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider

(A) programs determined to provide countervailable subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this subtitle, but only to the extent that such programs

(i) can potentially be used by the exporters or producers subject to the review under section 1675(c) of this title , and

(ii) did not exist at the time that the countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted, and

(B) programs newly alleged to provide countervailable subsidies but only to the extent that the administering authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to such programs and with respect to the exporters or producers subject to the review.

(3) Net countervailable subsidy

The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under section 1671d of this title or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title .

(4) Special rule

(A) Treatment of zero and de minimis rates

A net countervailable subsidy described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy.

(B) Application of de minimis standards

For purposes of this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under subsections (a) and (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title .
