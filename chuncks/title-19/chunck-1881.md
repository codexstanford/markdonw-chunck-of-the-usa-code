#### § 3203. Eligible articles
##### (c) Suspension of duty-free treatment

(1) The President may by proclamation suspend the duty-free treatment provided by this chapter with respect to any eligible article and may proclaim a duty rate for such article if such action is proclaimed under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [ 19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.] or section 1862 of this title .

(2) In any report by the United States International Trade Commission to the President under section 202(f) of the Trade Act of 1974 [ 19 U.S.C. 2252(f) ] regarding any article for which duty-free treatment has been proclaimed by the President pursuant to this chapter, the Commission shall state whether and to what extent its findings and recommendations apply to such article when imported from beneficiary countries.

(3) For purposes of section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [ 19 U.S.C. 2253 ], the suspension of the duty-free treatment provided by this chapter shall be treated as an increase in duty.

(4) No proclamation providing solely for a suspension referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection with respect to any article shall be taken under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [ 19 U.S.C. 2253 ] unless the United States International Trade Commission, in addition to making an affirmative determination with respect to such article under section 202(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 [ 19 U.S.C. 2252(b) ], determines in the course of its investigation under such section that the serious injury (or threat thereof) substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article results from the duty-free treatment provided by this chapter.
