### CHAPTER 12— TRADE ACT OF 1974
#### § 2311. Agreements with States
##### (k) Verification of eligibility for program benefits

(1) In general

An agreement under this subpart shall provide that the State shall periodically redetermine that a worker receiving benefits under this subpart who is not a citizen or national of the United States remains in a satisfactory immigration status. Once satisfactory immigration status has been initially verified through the immigration status verification system described in section 1320b–7(d) of title 42 for purposes of establishing a worker’s eligibility for unemployment compensation, the State shall reverify the worker’s immigration status if the documentation provided during initial verification will expire during the period in which that worker is potentially eligible to receive benefits under this subpart. The State shall conduct such redetermination in a timely manner, utilizing the immigration status verification system described in section 1320b–7(d) of title 42 .

(2) Procedures

The Secretary shall establish procedures to ensure the uniform application by the States of the requirements of this subsection.
