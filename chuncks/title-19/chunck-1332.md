#### § 2291. Qualifying requirements for workers
##### (c) Waivers of training requirements

(1) Issuance of waivers

The Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the following reasons:

(A) Health

The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.

(B) Enrollment unavailable

The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.

(C) Training not available

Training approved by the Secretary is not reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area career and technical education schools, as defined in section 2302 of title 20 , and employers), no training that is suitable for the worker is available at a reasonable cost, or no training funds are available.

(2) Duration of waivers

(A) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (3)(B), a waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be effective for not more than 6 months after the date on which the waiver is issued, unless the Secretary determines otherwise.

(B) Revocation

The Secretary shall revoke a waiver issued under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the basis of a waiver is no longer applicable to the worker and shall notify the worker in writing of the revocation.

(3) Agreements under section 2311

(A) Issuance by cooperating States

An agreement under section 2311 of this title shall authorize a cooperating State to issue waivers as described in paragraph (1).

(B) Review of waivers

An agreement under section 2311 of this title shall require a cooperating State to review each waiver issued by the State under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1)

(i) 3 months after the date on which the State issues the waiver; and

(ii) on a monthly basis thereafter.

(C) Submission of statements

An agreement under section 2311 of this title shall include a requirement that the cooperating State submit to the Secretary the written statements provided under paragraph (1) and a statement of the reasons for the waiver.
