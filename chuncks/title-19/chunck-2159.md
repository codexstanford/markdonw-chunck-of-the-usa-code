#### § 4061. Commencing of action for relief
##### (b) Investigation and determination

Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a), the Commission, unless subsection (d) applies, shall promptly initiate an investigation to determine whether, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the Agreement, a CAFTA–DR article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions that imports of the CAFTA–DR article constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the imported article.
