#### § 1675. Administrative review of determinations
##### (c) Five-year review

(1) In general

Notwithstanding subsection (b) and except in the case of a transition order defined in paragraph (6), 5 years after the date of publication of

(A) a countervailing duty order (other than a countervailing duty order to which subparagraph (B) applies or which was issued without an affirmative determination of injury by the Commission under section 1303  1 of this title), an antidumping duty order, or a notice of suspension of an investigation, described in subsection (a)(1),

(B) a notice of injury determination under section 1675b of this title with respect to a countervailing duty order, or

(C) a determination under this section to continue an order or suspension agreement, the administering authority and the Commission shall conduct a review to determine, in accordance with section 1675a of this title , whether revocation of the countervailing or antidumping duty order or termination of the investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) and of material injury.

(2) Notice of initiation of review

Not later than 30 days before the fifth anniversary of the date described in paragraph (1), the administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of initiation of a review under this subsection and request that interested parties submit

(A) a statement expressing their willingness to participate in the review by providing information requested by the administering authority and the Commission,

(B) a statement regarding the likely effects of revocation of the order or termination of the suspended investigation, and

(C) such other information or industry data as the administering authority or the Commission may specify.

(3) Responses to notice of initiation

(A) No response

If no interested party responds to the notice of initiation under this subsection, the administering authority shall issue a final determination, within 90 days after the initiation of a review, revoking the order or terminating the suspended investigation to which such notice relates. For purposes of this paragraph, an interested party means a party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title.

(B) Inadequate response

If interested parties provide inadequate responses to a notice of initiation, the administering authority, within 120 days after the initiation of the review, or the Commission, within 150 days after such initiation, may issue, without further investigation, a final determination based on the facts available, in accordance with section 1677e of this title .

(4) Waiver of participation by certain interested parties

(A) In general

An interested party described in section 1677(9)(A) or (B) of this title may elect not to participate in a review conducted by the administering authority under this subsection and to participate only in the review conducted by the Commission under this subsection.

(B) Effect of waiver

In a review in which an interested party waives its participation pursuant to this paragraph, the administering authority shall conclude that revocation of the order or termination of the investigation would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) with respect to that interested party.

(5) Conduct of review

(A) Time limits for completion of review

Unless the review has been completed pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) applies, the administering authority shall make its final determination pursuant to section 1675a(b) or (c) of this title within 240 days after the date on which a review is initiated under this subsection. If the administering authority makes a final affirmative determination, the Commission shall make its final determination pursuant to section 1675a(a) of this title within 360 days after the date on which a review is initiated under this subsection.

(B) Extension of time limit

The administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may extend the period of time for making their respective determinations under this subsection by not more than 90 days, if the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) determines that the review is extraordinarily complicated. In a review in which the administering authority extends the time for making a final determination, but the Commission does not extend the time for making a determination, the Commission’s determination shall be made not later than 120 days after the date on which the final determination of the administering authority is published.

(C) Extraordinarily complicated

For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may treat a review as extraordinarily complicated if

(i) there is a large number of issues,

(ii) the issues to be considered are complex,

(iii) there is a large number of firms involved,

(iv) the orders or suspended investigations have been grouped as described in subparagraph (D), or

(v) it is a review of a transition order.

(D) Grouped reviews

The Commission, in consultation with the administering authority, may group orders or suspended investigations for review if it considers that such grouping is appropriate and will promote administrative efficiency. Where orders or suspended investigations have been grouped, the Commission shall, subject to subparagraph (B), make its final determination under this subsection not later than 120 days after the date that the administering authority publishes notice of its final determination with respect to the last order or agreement in the group.
