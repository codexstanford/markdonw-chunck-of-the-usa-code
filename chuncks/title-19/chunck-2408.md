#### § 4531. Rules of origin
##### (n) Nonqualifying operations

A good shall not be considered to be an originating good merely by reason of

(2) any production or pricing practice with respect to which it may be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the object of the practice was to circumvent this section.
