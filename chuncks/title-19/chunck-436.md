#### § 1484. Entry of merchandise
##### (j) Treatment of multiple entries of merchandise as single transaction

In the case of merchandise that is purchased and invoiced as a single entity but

(1) is shipped in an unassembled or disassembled condition in separate shipments due to the size or nature of the merchandise, or

(2) is shipped in separate shipments due to the inability of the carrier to include all of the merchandise in a single shipment (at the instruction of the carrier), the Customs Service may, upon application by an importer in advance, treat such separate shipments for entry purposes as a single transaction.
