##### (a) Findings

Congress finds the following:

(1) Israel is America’s dependable, democratic ally in the Middle East—an area of paramount strategic importance to the United States.

(2) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement formed the modern foundation of the bilateral commercial relationship between the two countries and was the first such agreement signed by the United States with a foreign country.

(3) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement has been instrumental in expanding commerce and the strategic relationship between the United States and Israel.

(4) More than $45,000,000,000 in goods and services is traded annually between the two countries, in addition to roughly $10,000,000,000 in United States foreign direct investment in Israel.

(5) The United States continues to look for and find new opportunities to enhance cooperation with Israel, including through the enactment of the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 ( Public Law 112–150 ; 22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) and the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 ( Public Law 113–296 ; 128 Stat. 4075 ).

(6) It has been the policy of the United States Government to combat all elements of the Arab League Boycott of Israel by

(as continued in effect pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), including sections to ensure foreign persons comply with applicable reporting requirements relating to the Boycott;

(C) enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 ( Public Law 94–455 ; 90 Stat. 1520 ) that denies certain tax benefits to entities abiding by the Boycott;
