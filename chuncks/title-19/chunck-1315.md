(A) by contacting

(i) officials or employees of the workers’ firm;

(ii) officials of customers of the workers’ firm;

(iii) officials of certified or recognized unions or other duly authorized representatives of the group of workers; or

(3) Verification of information

(A) Certification

The Secretary shall require a firm or customer to certify

(i) all information obtained under paragraph (1) from the firm or customer (as the case may be) through questionnaires; and

(ii) all other information obtained under paragraph (1) from the firm or customer (as the case may be) on which the Secretary relies in making a determination under section 2273 of this title , unless the Secretary has a reasonable basis for determining that such information is accurate and complete without being certified.

(B) Use of subpoenas

The Secretary shall require the workers’ firm or a customer of the workers’ firm to provide information requested by the Secretary under paragraph (1) by subpoena pursuant to section 2321 of this title if the firm or customer (as the case may be) fails to provide the information within 20 days after the date of the Secretary’s request, unless the firm or customer (as the case may be) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the firm or customer (as the case may be) will provide the information within a reasonable period of time.

(C) Protection of confidential information

The Secretary may not release information obtained under paragraph (1) that the Secretary considers to be confidential business information unless the firm or customer (as the case may be) submitting the confidential business information had notice, at the time of submission, that the information would be released by the Secretary, or the firm or customer (as the case may be) subsequently consents to the release of the information. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary from providing such confidential business information to a court in camera or to another party under a protective order issued by a court.
