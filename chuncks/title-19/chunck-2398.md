##### (d) Regional value content

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (5), for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (D) of subsection (c)(1), the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the importer, exporter, or producer of the good, on the basis of

(A) the transaction value method described in paragraph (2); or

(B) the net cost method described in paragraph (3).

(2) Transaction value method

(A) In general

An importer, exporter, or producer of a good may calculate the regional value content of the good on the basis of the following transaction value method:   rvc

=

tv–vnm

×

100

tv

(B) Definitions

In this paragraph:

(i) RVC

The term “RVC” means the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage.

(ii) TV

The term “TV” means the transaction value of the good, adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good.

(iii) VNM

The term “VNM” means the value of nonoriginating materials used by the producer in the production of the good.

(3) Net cost method

(A) In general

An importer, exporter, or producer of a good may calculate the regional value content of the good on the basis of the following net cost method:   rvc

=

nc–vnm

×

100

nc

(B) Definitions

In this paragraph:

(i) NC

The term “NC” means the net cost of the good.

(ii) RVC

The term “RVC” means the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage.

(iii) VNM

(4) Value of nonoriginating materials

(A) In general

The value of nonoriginating materials used by the producer in the production of a good shall not, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good under paragraph (2) or (3), include the value of nonoriginating materials used or consumed to produce originating materials that are subsequently used or consumed in the production of the good.

(B) Special rule for certain components

The following components of the value of nonoriginating materials used by the producer in the production of a good may be counted as originating content for purposes of determining whether the good meets the regional value content requirement set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA:

(i) The value of processing the nonoriginating materials undertaken in the territory of one or more USMCA countries.

(ii) The value of any originating materials used or consumed in the production of the nonoriginating materials undertaken in the territory of one or more USMCA countries.

(5) Net cost method required in certain cases

An importer, exporter, or producer of a good shall calculate the regional value content of the good solely on the basis of the net cost method described in paragraph (3) if the rule for the good set forth in Annex 4–B of the USMCA includes a regional value content requirement not based on the transaction value method described in paragraph (2).

(6) Net cost method allowed for adjustments

(A) In general

If an importer, exporter, or producer of a good calculates the regional value content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method described in paragraph (2) and a USMCA country subsequently notifies the importer, exporter, or producer, during the course of a verification conducted in accordance with chapter 5 or 6 of the USMCA, that the transaction value of the good or the value of any material used in the production of the good must be adjusted or is unacceptable under article 1 of the Customs Valuation Agreement, the importer, exporter, or producer may calculate the regional value content of the good on the basis of the net cost method.

(B) Review of adjustment

Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to prevent any review or appeal available in accordance with article 5.15 of the USMCA with respect to an adjustment to or a rejection of

(i) the transaction value of a good; or

(ii) the value of any material used in the production of a good.

(7) Calculating net cost

The producer of a good may, consistent with regulations implementing this section, calculate the net cost of the good under paragraph (3) by

(A) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtracting any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales services costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of those goods, and then reasonably allocating the resulting net cost of those goods to the good;

(B) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating the total cost to the good, and subtracting any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs, that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the good; or

(C) reasonably allocating each cost that is part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of those costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and nonallowable interest costs.

(8) Value of materials used in production

For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good under this subsection, applying the de minimis rules under subsection (f), and calculating the value of nonoriginating components in a set under subsection (m), the value of a material used in the production of a good is

(A) in the case of a material that is imported by the producer of the good, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the material;

(B) in the case of a material acquired in the territory in which the good is produced

(i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the USMCA country where the producer is located;

(ii) the value as determined under subparagraph (A), as set forth in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury providing for the application of transaction value in the absence of an importation by the producer; or

(iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the country; or

(C) in the case of a self-produced material, the sum of

(i) all expenses incurred in the production of the material, including general expenses; and

(ii) an amount for profit equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the material.

(9) Intermediate materials

(A) In general

Any self-produced material that is used in the production of a good may be designated by the producer of the good as an intermediate material for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good under paragraph (2) or (3).

(B) Materials used in production of intermediate materials

If a self-produced material is designated as an intermediate material under subparagraph (A) for purposes of calculating a regional value content requirement, no other self-produced material subject to a regional value content requirement used or consumed in the production of that intermediate material may be designated by the producer as an intermediate material.

(10) Further adjustments to value of materials

The following expenses, if included in the value of a nonoriginating material calculated under paragraph (8), may be deducted from the value of the nonoriginating material:

(A) The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer.

(B) Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more USMCA countries, other than duties or taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable.

(C) The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or byproducts.
