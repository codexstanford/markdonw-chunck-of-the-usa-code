#### § 1677f–1. Sampling and averaging; determination of weighted average dumping margin and countervailable subsidy rate
##### (f) Adjustment of antidumping duty in certain proceedings relating to imports from nonmarket economy countries

(1) In general

If the administering authority determines, with respect to a class or kind of merchandise from a nonmarket economy country for which an antidumping duty is determined using normal value pursuant to section 1677b(c) of this title , that

(A) pursuant to section 1671(a)(1) of this title , a countervailable subsidy (other than an export subsidy referred to in section 1677a(c)(1)(C) of this title ) has been provided with respect to the class or kind of merchandise,

(B) such countervailable subsidy has been demonstrated to have reduced the average price of imports of the class or kind of merchandise during the relevant period, and

(C) the administering authority can reasonably estimate the extent to which the countervailable subsidy referred to in subparagraph (B), in combination with the use of normal value determined pursuant to section 1677b(c) of this title , has increased the weighted average dumping margin for the class or kind of merchandise, the administering authority shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), reduce the antidumping duty by the amount of the increase in the weighted average dumping margin estimated by the administering authority under subparagraph (C).

(2) Maximum reduction in antidumping duty

The administering authority may not reduce the antidumping duty applicable to a class or kind of merchandise from a nonmarket economy country under this subsection by more than the portion of the countervailing duty rate attributable to a countervailable subsidy that is provided with respect to the class or kind of merchandise and that meets the conditions described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1).
