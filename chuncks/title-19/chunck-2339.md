##### (c) Remedial action

(1) In general

If, on or after the date that is one year after the commencement of enhanced bilateral engagement by the President, through the Secretary, with respect to a country under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary determines that the country has failed to adopt appropriate policies to correct the undervaluation and surpluses described in subsection (b)(1)(A) with respect to that country, the President shall take one or more of the following actions:

(A) Prohibit the United States International Development Finance Corporation from approving any new financing (including any insurance, reinsurance, or guarantee) with respect to a project located in that country on and after such date.

(B) Except as provided in paragraph (3), and pursuant to paragraph (4), prohibit the Federal Government from procuring, or entering into any contract for the procurement of, goods or services from that country on and after such date.

(C) Instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund to call for additional rigorous surveillance of the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of that country and, as appropriate, formal consultations on findings of currency manipulation.

(D) Instruct the United States Trade Representative to take into account, in consultation with the Secretary, in assessing whether to enter into a bilateral or regional trade agreement with that country or to initiate or participate in negotiations with respect to a bilateral or regional trade agreement with that country, the extent to which that country has failed to adopt appropriate policies to correct the undervaluation and surpluses described in subsection (b)(1)(A).

(2) Waiver

(A) In general

The President may waive the requirement under paragraph (1) to take remedial action if the President determines that taking remedial action under paragraph (1) would

(i) have an adverse impact on the United States economy greater than the benefits of taking remedial action; or

(ii) would cause serious harm to the national security of the United States.

(B) Certification and report

The President shall promptly certify to Congress a determination under subparagraph (A) and promptly submit to Congress a report that describes in detail the reasons for the President’s determination under subparagraph (A).

(3) Exception

The President may not apply a prohibition under paragraph (1)(B) in a manner that is inconsistent with United States obligations under international agreements.

(4) Consultations

(A) Office of Management and Budget

Before applying a prohibition under paragraph (1)(B), the President shall consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to determine whether such prohibition would subject the taxpayers of the United States to unreasonable cost.

(B) Congress

The President shall consult with the appropriate committees of Congress with respect to any action the President takes under paragraph (1)(B), including whether the President has consulted as required under subparagraph (A).
