(A) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof: Provided , That the enactment of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 shall not be construed to determine or indicate the approval or disapproval by the Congress of the executive agreement known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

(A) Increasing by more than 50 per centum any rate of duty existing on July 1, 1934 ; except that a specific rate of duty existing on July 1, 1934 , may be converted to its ad valorem equivalent based on the value of imports of the article concerned during the calendar year 1934 (determined in the same manner as provided in subparagraph (D)(ii)) and the proclamation may provide an ad valorem rate of duty not in excess of 50 per centum above such ad valorem equivalent.
