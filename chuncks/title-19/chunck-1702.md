## SUBTITLE VI— SOFTWOOD LUMBER
### CHAPTER 14— CONVENTION ON CULTURAL PROPERTY
#### § 2602. Agreements to implement Article 9 of the convention
##### (c) Restrictions on entering into agreements

(1) In general

The President may not enter into a bilateral or multilateral agreement authorized by subsection (a) unless the application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title with respect to archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party making a request to the United States under article 9 of the Convention will be applied in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented, by those nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material.

(2) Exception to restrictions

Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President may enter into an agreement if he determines that a nation individually having a significant import trade in such material is not implementing, or is not likely to implement, similar restrictions, but

(A) such restrictions are not essential to deter a serious situation of pillage, and

(B) the application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented, by other nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage.
