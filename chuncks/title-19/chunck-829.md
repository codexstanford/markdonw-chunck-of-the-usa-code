#### § 1673b. Preliminary determinations
##### (b) Preliminary determination by administering authority

(1) Period of antidumping duty investigation

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 140 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1673a(c) of this title , or an investigation is initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title , but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold, or is likely to be sold, at less than fair value.

(B) If certain short life cycle merchandise involved

If a petition filed under section 1673a(b) of this title , or an investigation initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title , concerns short life cycle merchandise that is included in a product category established under section 1673h(a) of this title , subparagraph (A) shall be applied

(i) by substituting “100 days” for “140 days” if manufacturers that are second offenders account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation, and

(ii) by substituting “80 days” for “140 days” if manufacturers that are multiple offenders account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation.

(C) Definitions of offenders

For purposes of subparagraph (B)

(i) The term “second offender” means a manufacturer that is specified in 2 affirmative dumping determinations (within the meaning of section 1673h of this title ) as the manufacturer of short life cycle merchandise that is

(I) specified in both such determinations, and

(II) within the scope of the product category referred to in subparagraph (B).

(ii) The term “multiple offender” means a manufacturer that is specified in 3 or more affirmative dumping determinations (within the meaning of section 1673h of this title ) as the manufacturer of short life cycle merchandise that is

(I) specified in each of such determinations, and

(II) within the scope of the product category referred to in subparagraph (B).

(2) Preliminary determination under waiver of verification

Within 75 days after the initiation of an investigation, the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 60 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title . Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a preliminary determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made within 90 days after the initiation of the investigation on the basis of the record established during the first 60 days after the investigation was initiated.

(3) De minimis dumping margin

In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any weighted average dumping margin that is de minimis. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a weighted average dumping margin is de minimis if the administering authority determines that it is less than 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.
