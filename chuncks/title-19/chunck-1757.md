(1) In general

The preferential treatment under subsection (b)(1) shall not apply unless the President certifies to Congress that Haiti is meeting the following conditions:

(A) Haiti has adopted an effective visa system, domestic laws, and enforcement procedures applicable to articles described in subsection (b) to prevent unlawful transshipment of the articles and the use of counterfeit documents relating to the importation of the articles into the United States.

(B) Haiti has enacted legislation or promulgated regulations that would permit U.S. Customs and Border Protection verification teams to have the access necessary to investigate thoroughly allegations of transshipment through such country.

(C) Haiti agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, on the total exports from and imports into that country of articles described in subsection (b), consistent with the manner in which the records are kept by Haiti.

(D) Haiti agrees to cooperate fully with the United States to address and take action necessary to prevent circumvention as provided in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.

(E) Haiti agrees to require all producers and exporters of articles described in subsection (b) in that country to maintain complete records of the production and the export of such articles, including materials used in the production, for at least 5 years after the production or export (as the case may be).

(F) Haiti agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, documentation establishing the country of origin of articles described in subsection (b) as used by that country in implementing an effective visa system.

(2) Definition of transshipment

Transshipment within the meaning of this subsection has occurred when preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article under this section has been claimed on the basis of material false information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of the article or any of its components. For purposes of this paragraph, false information is material if disclosure of the true information would mean or would have meant that the article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under this section.

(3) Limitation on goods shipped from the Dominican Republic

(A) Limitation

Notwithstanding subsection (a)(5), relating to the definition of “imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic”, articles described in subsection (b) that are shipped from the Dominican Republic, directly or through the territory of an intermediate country, whether or not such articles undergo processing in the Dominican Republic, shall not be considered to be “imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic” until the President certifies to the Congress that Haiti and the Dominican Republic have developed procedures to prevent unlawful transshipment of the articles and the use of counterfeit documents related to the importation of the articles into the United States.

(B) Technical and other assistance

The Commissioner responsible for U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall provide technical and other assistance to Haiti and the Dominican Republic to develop expeditiously the procedures described in subparagraph (A).
