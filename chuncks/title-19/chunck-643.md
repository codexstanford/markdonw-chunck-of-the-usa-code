## SUBTITLE III— ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
#### § 1592. Penalties for fraud, gross negligence, and negligence
##### (l) False certifications of origin under the United States–Panama Trade Promotion Agreement

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), it is unlawful for any person to certify falsely, by fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, in a Panama TPA certification of origin (as defined in section 1508 of this title ) that a good exported from the United States qualifies as an originating good under the rules of origin provided for in section 203 of the United States–Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. The procedures and penalties of this section that apply to a violation of subsection (a) also apply to a violation of this subsection.

(2) Prompt and voluntary disclosure of incorrect information

No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection if, promptly after an exporter or producer that issued a Panama TPA certification of origin has reason to believe that such certification contains or is based on incorrect information, the exporter or producer voluntarily provides written notice of such incorrect information to every person to whom the certification was issued.

(3) Exception

A person shall not be considered to have violated paragraph (1) if

(A) the information was correct at the time it was provided in a Panama TPA certification of origin but was later rendered incorrect due to a change in circumstances; and

(B) the person promptly and voluntarily provides written notice of the change in circumstances to all persons to whom the person provided the certification.
