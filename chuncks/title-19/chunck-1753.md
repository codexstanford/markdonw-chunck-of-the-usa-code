(iii) Other articles described

Made-up textile articles described in this clause are articles that fall within statistical reporting number 6406.10.9090 of the HTS (as in effect on the day before May 24, 2010 ).

(iv) Category defined

In this subparagraph, the term “category” has the meaning given that term in paragraph (2A)(E) of this subsection.

(4) Earned import allowance rule

(A) In general

Apparel articles wholly assembled, or knit-to-shape, in Haiti from any combination of fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns and imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic shall enter the United States free of duty, without regard to the source of the fabric, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns from which the articles are made, if such apparel articles are accompanied by an earned import allowance certificate that reflects the amount of credits equal to the total square meter equivalents of such apparel articles, in accordance with the program established under subparagraph (B). For purposes of determining the quantity of square meter equivalents under this subparagraph, the conversion factors listed in “Correlation: U.S. Textile and Apparel Industry Category System with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States of America, 2008”, or its successor publications, of the United States Department of Commerce, shall apply.

(B) Earned import allowance program

(i) Establishment

The Secretary of Commerce shall establish a program to provide earned import allowance certificates to any producer or entity controlling production for purposes of subparagraph (A), based on the elements described in clause (ii).

(ii) Elements

The elements referred to in clause (i) are the following:

(I) One credit shall be issued to a producer or an entity controlling production for every two square meter equivalents of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric that the producer or entity controlling production can demonstrate that it purchased for the manufacture in Haiti of articles like or similar to any article eligible for preferential treatment under subparagraph (A). The Secretary of Commerce shall, if requested by a producer or entity controlling production, create and maintain an account for such producer or entity controlling production, into which such credits shall be deposited.

(II) Such producer or entity controlling production may redeem credits issued under subclause (I) for earned import allowance certificates reflecting such number of earned credits as the producer or entity may request and has available.

(III) The Secretary of Commerce may require any textile mill or other entity located in the United States that exports to Haiti qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric to submit, upon such export or upon request, documentation, such as a Shipper’s Export Declaration, to the Secretary of Commerce

(aa) verifying that the qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric was exported to a producer in Haiti or to an entity controlling production; and

(bb) identifying such producer or entity controlling production, and the quantity and description of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric exported to such producer or entity controlling production.

(IV) The Secretary of Commerce may require that a producer or entity controlling production submit documentation to verify purchases of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric.

(V) The Secretary of Commerce may make available to each person or entity identified in documentation submitted under subclause (III) or (IV) information contained in such documentation that relates to the purchase of qualifying woven fabric or qualifying knit fabric involving such person or entity.

(VI) The program under this subparagraph shall be established so as to allow, to the extent feasible, the submission, storage, retrieval, and disclosure of information in electronic format, including information with respect to the earned import allowance certificates required under subparagraph (A)(i). 2

(VII) The Secretary of Commerce may reconcile discrepancies in information provided under subclause (III) or (IV) and verify the accuracy of such information.

(VIII) The Secretary of Commerce shall establish procedures to carry out the program under this subparagraph and may establish additional requirements to carry out this subparagraph. Such additional requirements may include

(aa) submissions by textile mills or other entities in the United States documenting exports of yarns wholly formed in the United States to countries described in paragraph (1)(B)(iii) for the manufacture of qualifying knit fabric; and

(bb) procedures imposed on producers or entities controlling production to allow the Secretary of Commerce to obtain and verify information relating to the production of qualifying knit fabric.

(iii) Qualifying woven fabric defined

For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “qualifying woven fabric” means fabric wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States, except that

(I) fabric otherwise eligible as qualifying woven fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying woven fabric because the fabric contains nylon filament yarn to which section 2703(b)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of this title applies;

(II) fabric that would otherwise be ineligible as qualifying woven fabric because the fabric contains yarns not wholly formed in the United States shall not be ineligible as qualifying woven fabric if the total weight of all such yarns is not more than 10 percent of the total weight of the fabric; and

(III) fabric otherwise eligible as qualifying woven fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying fabric because the fabric contains yarns covered by clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (5)(A).

(iv) Qualifying knit fabric defined

For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “qualifying knit fabric” means fabric or knit-to-shape components wholly formed or knit-to-shape in any country or any combination of countries described in paragraph (1)(B)(iii), from yarns wholly formed in the United States, except that

(I) fabric or knit-to-shape components otherwise eligible as qualifying knit fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric because the fabric or knit-to-shape components contain nylon filament yarn to which section 2703(b)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of this title applies;

(II) fabric or knit-to-shape components that would otherwise be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric because the fabric or knit-to-shape components contain yarns not wholly formed in the United States shall not be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric if the total weight of all such yarns is not more than 10 percent of the total weight of the fabric or knit-to-shape components; and

(III) fabric or knit-to-shape components otherwise eligible as qualifying knit fabric shall not be ineligible as qualifying knit fabric because the fabric or knit-to-shape components contain yarns covered by clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (5)(A).

(C) Enforcement provisions

(i) Fraudulent claims of preference

Any person who makes a false claim for preference under the program established under subparagraph (B) shall be subject to any applicable civil or criminal penalty that may be imposed under the customs laws of the United States or under title 18.

(ii) Penalties for other fraudulent information

The Secretary of Commerce may establish and impose penalties for the submission to the Secretary of Commerce of fraudulent information under the program established under subparagraph (B), other than a claim described in clause (i).

(5) Short supply provision

(A) In general

Any apparel article that is wholly assembled, or knit-to-shape, in Haiti from any combination of fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns and is imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic shall enter the United States free of duty, without regard to the source of the fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns from which the article is made, if the fabrics, fabric components, components knit-to-shape, or yarns comprising the component that determines the tariff classification of the article are of any of the following:

(i) Fabrics or yarns, to the extent that apparel articles of such fabrics or yarns would be eligible for preferential treatment, without regard to the source of the fabrics or yarns, under Annex 4–B of the USMCA.

(ii) Fabrics or yarns, to the extent that such fabrics or yarns are designated as not being available in commercial quantities for purposes of

(I) section 2703(b)(2)(A)(v) of this title ;

(II) section 3721(b)(5) of this title ;

(III) clause (i)(III) or (ii) of section 3203(b)(3)(B) of this title ; or

(IV) any other provision, relating to determining whether a textile or apparel article is an originating good eligible for preferential treatment, of a law that implements a free trade agreement entered into by the United States that is in effect at the time the claim for preferential treatment is made.

(B) Removal of designation of fabrics or yarns not available in commercial quantities

If the President determines that

(i) any fabric or yarn described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) was determined to be eligible for preferential treatment, or

(ii) any fabric or yarn described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) was designated as not being available in commercial quantities, on the basis of fraud, the President is authorized to remove the eligibility or designation (as the case may be) of that fabric or yarn with respect to articles entered after such removal.

(6) Other preferential treatment not affected

The duty-free treatment provided under this subsection is in addition to any other preferential treatment under this chapter.
