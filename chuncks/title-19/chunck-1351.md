#### § 2296. Training
##### (a) In general
######### (ii) Subject to clause (iii), in determining how to apportion the initial distribution of funds pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) in a fiscal year, the Secretary shall take into account, with respect to each State

(I) the trend in the number of workers covered by certifications of eligibility under this part during the most recent 4 consecutive calendar quarters for which data are available;

(II) the trend in the number of workers participating in training under this section during the most recent 4 consecutive calendar quarters for which data are available;

(III) the number of workers estimated to be participating in training under this section during the fiscal year;

(IV) the amount of funding estimated to be necessary to provide training approved under this section to such workers during the fiscal year; and

(V) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title.

(iii) In no case may the amount of the initial distribution to a State pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i) in a fiscal year be less than 25 percent of the initial distribution to the State in the preceding fiscal year.

(D) The Secretary shall establish procedures for the distribution of the funds that remain available for the fiscal year after the initial distribution required under subparagraph (B)(i). Such procedures may include the distribution of funds pursuant to requests submitted by States in need of such funds.

(E) If, during a fiscal year, the Secretary estimates that the amount of funds necessary to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title will exceed the dollar amount limitation specified in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall decide how the amount of funds made available to carry out this section and sections 2295, 2297, and 2298 of this title that have not been distributed at the time of the estimate will be apportioned among the States for the remainder of the fiscal year.

(3) For purposes of applying paragraph (1)(C), a reasonable expectation of employment does not require that employment opportunities for a worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of training approved under paragraph (1).

(4)

(A) If the costs of training an adversely affected worker or an adversely affected incumbent worker are paid by the Secretary under paragraph (1), no other payment for such costs may be made under any other provision of Federal law.
