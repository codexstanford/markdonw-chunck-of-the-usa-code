##### (b) Engagement on exchange rate and economic policies

(1) In general

The President, through the Secretary, shall commence enhanced bilateral engagement with each country for which an enhanced analysis of macroeconomic and currency exchange rate policies is included in the report submitted under subsection (a), in order to, as appropriate

(B) express the concern of the United States with respect to the adverse trade and economic effects of that undervaluation and those surpluses;

(D) develop a plan with specific actions to address that undervaluation and those surpluses.

(2) Waiver

(A) In general

(B) Certification and report

The Secretary shall promptly certify to Congress a determination under subparagraph (A) and promptly submit to Congress a report that describes in detail the reasons for the Secretary’s determination under subparagraph (A).
