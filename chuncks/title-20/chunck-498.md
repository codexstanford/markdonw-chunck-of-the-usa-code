#### § 926. School system for dependents in overseas areas
##### (b) Tuition and assistance when schools unavailable

(1) Under such circumstances as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe in regulations, the Secretary may provide tuition to allow dependents in an overseas area where a school operated by the Secretary is not reasonably available to attend schools other than schools established under subsection (a) on a tuition-free basis. Schools to which tuition may be paid under this subsection may include private boarding schools in the United States. Any school to which tuition is paid under this subsection to allow a dependent in an overseas area to attend such school shall provide an educational program satisfactory to the Secretary.

(2)

(A) The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service of the Navy, may provide financial assistance to sponsors of dependents in overseas areas where schools operated by the Secretary of Defense under subsection (a) are not reasonably available in order to assist the sponsors to defray the costs incurred by the sponsors for the attendance of the dependents at schools in such areas other than schools operated by the Secretary of Defense.

(B) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each prescribe regulations relating to the availability of financial assistance under subparagraph (A). Such regulations shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be consistent with Department of State regulations relating to the availability of financial assistance for the education of dependents of Department of State personnel overseas.
