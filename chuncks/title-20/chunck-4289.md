#### § 7427. Student eligibility forms
##### (d) Documentation and types of proof

(1) Types of proof

For purposes of determining whether a child is eligible to be counted for the purpose of computing the amount of a grant award under section 7423 of this title , the membership of the child, or any parent or grandparent of the child, in a tribe or band of Indians (as so defined) may be established by proof other than an enrollment number, notwithstanding the availability of an enrollment number for a member of such tribe or band. Nothing in subsection (b) shall be construed to require the furnishing of an enrollment number.

(2) No new or duplicative determinations

Once a child is determined to be an Indian eligible to be counted for such grant award, the local educational agency shall maintain a record of such determination and shall not require a new or duplicate determination to be made for such child for a subsequent application for a grant under this subpart.

(3) Previously filed forms

An Indian student eligibility form that was on file as required by this section on the day before December 10, 2015 , and that met the requirements of this section, as this section was in effect on the day before December 10, 2015 , shall remain valid for such Indian student.
