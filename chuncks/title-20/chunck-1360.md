### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1085. Definitions for student loan insurance program
##### (m) Cohort default rate

(1) In general

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term “cohort default rate” means, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on loans under section 1078, 1078–1, 1 or 1078–8 of this title received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title that is used to repay any such loans) received for attendance at that institution in that fiscal year who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the students entered repayment. The Secretary shall require that each guaranty agency that has insured loans for current or former students of the institution afford such institution a reasonable opportunity (as specified by the Secretary) to review and correct errors in the information required to be provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agency for the purposes of calculating a cohort default rate for such institution, prior to the calculation of such rate.

(B) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such second fiscal year, the Secretary shall include only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency has paid claims for insurance. In considering appeals with respect to cohort default rates pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the Secretary shall exclude, from the calculation of the number of students who entered repayment and from the calculation of the number of students who default, any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the institution’s timely appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of such cohort default rate.

(C) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution’s current and former students enter repayment, the term “cohort default rate” means the percentage of such current and former students who entered repayment on such loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title that is used to repay any such loans) in any of the three most recent fiscal years, who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the year in which they entered repayment.

(2) Special rules

(A) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and such student’s subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to each school for attendance at which the student received a loan that entered repayment in the fiscal year.

(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the school, such school’s owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such school, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for purposes of this subsection.

(C) Any loan which has been rehabilitated before the end of the second fiscal year following the year in which the loan entered repayment is not considered as in default for purposes of this subsection. The Secretary may require guaranty agencies to collect data with respect to defaulted loans in a manner that will permit the identification of any defaulted loan for which (i) the borrower is currently making payments and has made not less than 6 consecutive on-time payments by the end of such second fiscal year, and (ii) a guaranty agency has renewed the borrower’s subchapter IV eligibility as provided in section 1078–6(b) of this title .

(D) For the purposes of this subsection, a loan made in accordance with section 1078–1  1 of this title (or the portion of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title that is used to repay a loan made under section 1078–1  1 of this title) shall not be considered to enter repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in a course of study leading to a degree or certificate at an eligible institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined by the institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance based on such enrollment. Each eligible lender of a loan made under section 1078–1  1 of this title (or a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title a portion of which is used to repay a loan made under section 1078–1  1 of this title) shall provide the guaranty agency with the information necessary to determine when the loan entered repayment for purposes of this subsection, and the guaranty agency shall provide such information to the Secretary.

(3) Regulations to prevent evasions

The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a default rate determination under this subsection through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control, or any similar device.

(4) Collection and reporting of cohort default rates and life of cohort default rates

(A) The Secretary shall publish not less often than once every fiscal year a report showing cohort default data and life of cohort default rates for each category of institution, including: (i) four-year public institutions; (ii) four-year private nonprofit institutions; (iii) two-year public institutions; (iv) two-year private nonprofit institutions; (v) four-year proprietary institutions; (vi) two-year proprietary institutions; and (vii) less than two-year proprietary institutions. For purposes of this subparagraph, for any fiscal year in which one or more current and former students at an institution enter repayment on loans under section 1078, 1078–2, or 1078–8 of this title, received for attendance at the institution, the Secretary shall publish the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title that is used to repay any such loans) received for attendance at the institution in that fiscal year who default before the end of each succeeding fiscal year.

(B) The Secretary may designate such additional subcategories within the categories specified in subparagraph (A) as the Secretary deems appropriate.

(C) The Secretary shall publish not less often than once every fiscal year a report showing default data for each institution for which a cohort default rate is calculated under this subsection.

(D) The Secretary shall publish the report described in subparagraph (C) by September 30 of each year.
