(1) In general

The Association is authorized, subject to the provisions of this section

(A) pursuant to commitments or otherwise to make advances on the security of, purchase, or repurchase, service, sell or resell, offer participations, or pooled interests or otherwise deal in, at prices and on terms and conditions determined by the Association, student loans which are insured by the Secretary under this part or by a guaranty agency;

(B) to buy, sell, hold, underwrite, and otherwise deal in obligations, if such obligations are issued, for the purpose of making or purchasing insured loans, by a guaranty agency or by an eligible lender in a State described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) or (F) of this title;

(C) to buy, sell, hold, insure, underwrite, and otherwise deal in obligations issued for the purpose of financing or refinancing the construction, reconstruction, renovation, improvement, or purchase at institutions of higher education of any of the following facilities (including the underlying property) and materials (including related equipment, instrumentation, and furnishings) at an eligible institution of higher education:

(i) educational and training facilities;

(ii) housing for students and faculties, dining halls, student unions, and facilities specifically designed to promote fitness and health for students, faculty, and staff or for physical education courses; and

(iii) library facilities, including the acquisition of library materials at institutions of higher education; except that not more than 30 percent of the value of transactions entered into under this subparagraph shall involve transactions of the types described in clause (ii);

(D) to undertake a program of loan insurance pursuant to agreements with the Secretary under section 1078 of this title , and except with respect to loans under subsection ( o ) of this section or under section 1078–3 of this title , the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the Association for such purpose only if the Secretary determines that (i) eligible borrowers are seeking and unable to obtain loans under this part, and (ii) no guaranty agency is capable of or willing to provide a program of loan insurance for such borrowers; and

(E) to undertake any other activity which the Board of Directors of the Association determines to be in furtherance of the programs of insured student loans authorized under this part or will otherwise support the credit needs of students, except that

(i) in carrying out all such activities the purpose shall always be to provide secondary market and other support for lending programs offered by other organizations and not to replace or compete with such other programs;

(ii) nothing in this subparagraph (E) shall be deemed to authorize the Association to acquire, own, operate, or control any bank, savings and loan association, savings bank or credit union; and

(iii) not later than 30 days prior to the initial implementation of a program undertaken pursuant to this subparagraph (E), the Association shall advise the Chairman and the Ranking Member on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives in writing of its plans to offer such program and shall provide information relating to the general terms and conditions of such program. The Association is further authorized to undertake any activity with regard to student loans which are not insured or guaranteed as provided for in this subsection as it may undertake with regard to insured or guaranteed student loans. Any warehousing advance made on the security of such loans shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection to the same extent as a warehousing advance made on the security of insured loans.

(2) Warehousing advances

Any warehousing advance made under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection shall be made on the security of (A) insured loans, (B) marketable obligations and securities issued, guaranteed, or insured by, the United States, or for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the repayment of principal and interest thereof, or (C) marketable obligations issued, guaranteed, or insured by any agency, instrumentality, or corporation of the United States for which the credit of such agency, instrumentality, or corporation is pledged for the repayment of principal and interest thereof, in an amount equal to the amount of such advance. The proceeds of any such advance secured by insured loans shall either be invested in additional insured loans or the lender shall provide assurances to the Association that during the period of the borrowing it will maintain a level of insured loans in its portfolio not less than the aggregate outstanding balance of such loans held at the time of the borrowing. The proceeds from any such advance secured by collateral described in clauses (B) and (C) shall be invested in additional insured student loans.

(3) Perfection of security interests in student loans

Notwithstanding the provisions of any State law to the contrary, including the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any State, a security interest in insured student loans created on behalf of the Association or any eligible lender as defined in section 1085(a) of this title may be perfected either through the taking of possession of such loans or by the filing of notice of such security interest in such loans in the manner provided by such State law for perfection of security interests in accounts.

(4) Form of securities

Securities issued pursuant to the offering of participations or pooled interests under paragraph (1) of this subsection may be in the form of debt obligations, or trust certificates of beneficial ownership, or both. Student loans set aside pursuant to the offering of participations or pooled interests shall at all times be adequate to ensure the timely principal and interest payments on such securities.

(5) Restrictions on facilities and housing activities

Not less than 75 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of obligations bought, sold, held, insured, underwritten, and otherwise supported in accordance with the authority contained in paragraph (1)(C) shall be obligations which are listed by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization at a rating below the second highest rating of such organization.
