From the remainder of the amount appropriated under section 2307 of this title and not reserved under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to a State for the fiscal year an amount equal to the amount the State received in fiscal year 2018.

(B) Ratable reduction

If for any fiscal year the amount appropriated for allotments under this section is insufficient to satisfy the provisions of subparagraph (A), the payments to all States under such subparagraph shall be ratably reduced.

(3) Additional funds

Subject to paragraph (4), from the additional funds remaining from the amount appropriated under section 2307 of this title and not expended under paragraphs (1) and (2) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to a State for the fiscal year

(A) an amount that bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the sum being allotted as the product of the population aged 15 to 19, inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State’s allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States;

(B) an amount that bears the same ratio to 20 percent of the sum being allotted as the product of the population aged 20 to 24, inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State’s allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States;

(C) an amount that bears the same ratio to 15 percent of the sum being allotted as the product of the population aged 25 to 65, inclusive, in the State in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the State’s allotment ratio bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States; and

(D) an amount that bears the same ratio to 15 percent of the sum being allotted as the amounts allotted to the State under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) for such years bears to the sum of the amounts allotted to all the States under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) for such year.

(4) Minimum allotment for years with additional funds

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), for a fiscal year for which there are additional funds described in paragraph (3), no State shall receive for such fiscal year under paragraph (3) less than 1/2 of 1 percent of the additional funds available for such fiscal year. Amounts necessary for increasing such payments to States to comply with the preceding sentence shall be obtained by ratably reducing the amounts to be paid to other States.

(B) Special rule

In the case of a qualifying State, the minimum allotment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year for the qualifying State shall be the lesser of

(i) 1/2 of 1 percent of the additional funds available for such fiscal year; and

(ii) the product of

(I) 1/3 of the additional funds; multiplied by

(II) the quotient of

(aa) the qualifying State’s ratio described in subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; divided by

(bb) the sum of all such ratios for all qualifying States for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

(C) Ratio

For purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii)(II)(aa), the ratio for a qualifying State for a fiscal year shall be 1.00 less the quotient of

(i) the amount the qualifying State is allotted under paragraph (3) for the fiscal year; divided by

(ii) 1/2 of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under paragraph (3) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

(D) Definitions

In this paragraph, the term “qualifying State” means a State (except the United States Virgin Islands) that, for the fiscal year for which a determination under this paragraph is made, would receive, under the allotment formula under paragraph (3) (without the application of this paragraph), an amount that would be less than the amount the State would receive under subparagraph (A) for such fiscal year.
