### CHAPTER 33— EDUCATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES
#### § 1413. Local educational agency eligibility
##### (i) Disciplinary information

The State may require that a local educational agency include in the records of a child with a disability a statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child and transmit such statement to the same extent that such disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children. The statement may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the child. If the State adopts such a policy, and the child transfers from 1 school to another, the transmission of any of the child’s records shall include both the child’s current individualized education program and any such statement of current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against the child.
