(A) withhold further payments to the recipient under this part;

(B) issue a complaint to compel compliance of the recipient through a cease and desist order; or

(C) enter into a compliance agreement with a recipient to bring it into compliance with such requirements, in  1 same manner as the Secretary is authorized to take such actions under sections 455, 456, and 457, respectively, of the General Education Provisions Act [ 20 U.S.C. 1234d , 1234e, 1234f].

The actions authorized by paragraph (1) are the exclusive remedies available with respect to the failure of a school to comply substantially with a provision of this section, and the Secretary shall not seek a recovery of funds from the recipient for such failure.

(3) Recommencement of payments

Whenever the Secretary determines (whether by certification or other appropriate evidence) that a recipient of funds who is subject to the withholding of payments under paragraph (1)(A) has cured the failure providing the basis for the withholding of payments, the Secretary shall cease the withholding of payments to the recipient under that paragraph.
