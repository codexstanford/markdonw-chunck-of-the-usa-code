#### § 1087dd. Terms of loans
##### (g) Discharge

(1) In general

If a student borrower who received a loan made under this part on or after January 1, 1986 , is unable to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due to the closure of the institution, then the Secretary shall discharge the borrower’s liability on the loan (including the interest and collection fees) and shall subsequently pursue any claim available to such borrower against the institution and the institution’s affiliates and principals, or settle the loan obligation pursuant to the financial responsibility standards described in section 1099c(c) of this title .

(2) Assignment

A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to have assigned to the United States the right to a loan refund in an amount that does not exceed the amount discharged against the institution and the institution’s affiliates and principals.

(3) Eligibility for additional assistance

The period during which a student was unable to complete a course of study due to the closing of the institution shall not be considered for purposes of calculating the student’s period of eligibility for additional assistance under this subchapter.

(4) Special rule

A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, because of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the discharged loan). The amount discharged under this subsection shall be treated as an amount canceled under section 1087ee(a) of this title .

(5) Reporting

The Secretary or institution, as the case may be, shall report to consumer reporting agencies with respect to loans that have been discharged pursuant to this subsection.
