#### § 1036. Graduate fellowships to prepare faculty in high-need areas at colleges of education
##### (e) Fellowship terms and conditions

(1) Selection of fellows

The Secretary shall ensure that an eligible institution that receives a grant under this section

(A) shall provide graduate fellowship awards to individuals who plan to pursue a career in instruction at an institution of higher education that has a teacher preparation program; and

(B) may not provide a graduate fellowship to an otherwise eligible individual

(i) during periods in which such individual is enrolled at an institution of higher education unless such individual is maintaining satisfactory academic progress in, and devoting full-time study or research to, the pursuit of the degree for which the fellowship support was provided; or

(ii) if the individual is engaged in gainful employment, other than part-time employment related to teaching, research, or a similar activity determined by the institution to be consistent with and supportive of the individuals’s  1 progress toward the degree for which the fellowship support was provided.

(2) Amount of fellowship awards

(A) In general

An eligible institution that receives a grant under this section shall award stipends to individuals who are provided graduate fellowships under this section.

(B) Awards based on need

A stipend provided under this section shall be in an amount equal to the level of support provided by the National Science Foundation graduate fellowships, except that such stipend shall be adjusted as necessary so as not to exceed the fellowship recipient’s demonstrated need, as determined by the institution of higher education where the fellowship recipient is enrolled.

(3) Service requirement

(A) Teaching required

Each individual who receives a graduate fellowship under this section and earns a doctoral degree shall teach for one year at an institution of higher education that has a teacher preparation program for each year of fellowship support received under this section.

(B) Institutional obligation

Each eligible institution that receives a grant under this section shall provide an assurance to the Secretary that the institution has inquired of and determined the decision of each individual who has received a graduate fellowship to, within three years of receiving a doctoral degree, begin employment at an institution of higher education that has a teacher preparation program, as required by this section.

(C) Agreement required

Prior to receiving an initial graduate fellowship award, and upon the annual renewal of the graduate fellowship award, an individual selected to receive a graduate fellowship under this section shall sign an agreement with the Secretary agreeing to pursue a career in instruction at an institution of higher education that has a teacher preparation program in accordance with subparagraph (A).

(D) Failure to comply

If an individual who receives a graduate fellowship award under this section fails to comply with the agreement signed pursuant to subparagraph (C), the sum of the amounts of any graduate fellowship award received by such recipient shall, upon a determination of such a failure, be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D of subchapter IV, and shall be subject to repayment, together with interest thereon accruing from the date of the fellowship award, in accordance with terms and conditions specified by the Secretary in regulations under this subpart.

(E) Modified service requirement

The Secretary may waive or modify the service requirement of this paragraph in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary with respect to the criteria to determine the circumstances under which compliance with such service requirement is inequitable or represents a substantial hardship. The Secretary may waive the service requirement if compliance by the fellowship recipient is determined to be inequitable or represent a substantial hardship

(i) because the individual is permanently and totally disabled at the time of the waiver request; or

(ii) based on documentation presented to the Secretary of substantial economic or personal hardship.
