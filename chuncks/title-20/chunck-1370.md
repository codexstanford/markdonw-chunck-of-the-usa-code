##### (b) Computation and payment

(1) Quarterly payment based on unpaid balance

A special allowance shall be paid for each of the 3-month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of every year and the amount of such allowance paid to any holder with respect to any 3-month period shall be a percentage of the average unpaid balance of principal (not including unearned interest added to principal) of all eligible loans held by such holder during such period.
