#### § 1072. Advances for reserve funds of State and nonprofit private loan insurance programs
##### (c) Advances for insurance obligations

(1) Use for payment of insurance obligations

From sums appropriated pursuant to section 1071(b)(4)(B) of this title , the Secretary shall advance to each State which has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1078(c) of this title with respect to a student loan insurance program, an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection to be used for the purpose of making payments under the State’s insurance obligations under such program.

(2) Amount of advances

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount to be advanced to each such State shall be equal to 10 percent of the principal amount of loans made by lenders and insured by such agency on those loans on which the first payment of principal became due during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the advance is made.

(B) The amount of any advance determined according to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be reduced by

(i) the amount of any advance or advances made to such State pursuant to this subsection at an earlier date; and

(ii) the amount of the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a). Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the preceding sentence of this subparagraph, but subject to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, the amount of any advance to a State described in paragraph (5)(A) for the first year of its eligibility under such paragraph, and the amount of any advance to any State described in paragraph (5)(B) for each year of its eligibility under such paragraph, shall not be less than $50,000.

(C) For the purpose of subparagraph (B), the unspent balance of the advances made to a State pursuant to subsection (a) shall be that portion of the balance of the State’s reserve fund (remaining at the time of the State’s first request for an advance pursuant to this subsection) which bears the same ratio to such balance as the Federal advances made and not returned by such State, pursuant to subsection (a), bears to the total of all past contributions to such reserve funds from all sources (other than interest on investment of any portion of the reserve fund) contributed since the date such State executed an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title .

(D) If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for paying the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) are not sufficient to pay such amounts in full, then such amounts shall be reduced

(i) by ratably reducing that portion of the amount allocated to each State which exceeds $50,000; and

(ii) if further reduction is required, by equally reducing the $50,000 minimum allocation of each State. If additional sums become available for paying such amounts for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence has been applied, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.

(3) Use of earnings for insurance obligations

The earnings, if any, on any investments of advances received pursuant to this subsection must be used for making payments under the State’s insurance obligations.

(4) Repayment of advances

Advances made by the Secretary under this subsection shall, subject to subsection (d), be repaid within such period as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate and shall be deposited in the fund established by section 1081 of this title .

(5) Limitation on number of advances

Except as provided in paragraph (7), advances pursuant to this subsection shall be made to a State

(A) in the case of a State which is actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title which was entered into before October 12, 1976 , upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977 , and on the same day of each of the 2 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested; and

(B) in the case of a State which enters into an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title on or after October 12, 1976 , or which is not actively carrying on a program under an agreement pursuant to such section on such date, upon such date as such State may request, but not before October 1, 1977 , and on the same day of each of the 4 succeeding calendar years after the date so requested of the advance.

(6) Payment of advances where no State program

(A) If for any fiscal year a State does not have a student loan insurance program covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title , and the Secretary determines after consultation with the chief executive officer of that State that there is no reasonable likelihood that the State will have such a student loan insurance program for such year, the Secretary may make advances pursuant to this subsection for such year for the same purpose to one or more nonprofit private institutions or organizations with which he has made an agreement pursuant to subsection (c), as well as subsection (b), of section 1078 of this title and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in order to enable students in that State to participate in a program of student loan insurance covered by such agreements.

(B) The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a private nonprofit institution or organization for the purpose of this paragraph under which such institution or organization

(i) agrees to establish within such State at least one office with sufficient staff to handle written, electronic, and telephone inquiries from students, eligible lenders, and other persons in the State, to encourage maximum commercial lender participation within the State, and to conduct periodic visits to at least the major eligible lenders within the State;

(ii) agrees that its insurance will not be denied any student because of his or her choice of eligible institutions; and

(iii) certifies that it is neither an eligible institution, nor has any substantial affiliation with an eligible institution.

(7) Emergency advances

The Secretary is authorized to make advances, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Secretary, to a guaranty agency

(A) in accordance with section 1078(j) of this title , in order to ensure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as the lender-of-last-resort; or

(B) if the Secretary is seeking to terminate the guaranty agency’s agreement, or assuming the guaranty agency’s functions, in accordance with section 1078(c)(9)(F)(v) of this title , in order to assist the agency in meeting its immediate cash needs, ensure the uninterrupted payment of claims, or ensure that the guaranty agency shall make loans as described in subparagraph (A).
