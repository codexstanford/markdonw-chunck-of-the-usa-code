##### (b) Assistance to outlying areas

(1) Funds reserved

From the amount made available for any fiscal year under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall

(A) first reserve $1,000,000 for the Republic of Palau, until Palau enters into an agreement for extension of United States educational assistance under the Compact of Free Association, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish, except that Public Law 95–134 , permitting the consolidation of grants, shall not apply; and

(B) use the remaining funds to award grants to the outlying areas in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (5).

(2) Amount of grants

The Secretary shall allocate the amount available under paragraph (1)(B) to the outlying areas in proportion to their relative numbers of children, aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from families below the poverty level, on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available from the Department of Commerce.

(3) Hold-harmless amounts

For each fiscal year, the amount made available to each outlying area under this subsection shall be

(A) not less than 95 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the number of children counted under paragraph (2) is not less than 30 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17 years, inclusive, in the outlying area;

(B) not less than 90 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the percentage described in subparagraph (A) is between 15 percent and 30 percent; and

(C) not less than 85 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the percentage described in subparagraph (A) is below 15 percent.

(4) Ratable reductions

If the amount made available under paragraph (1)(B) for any fiscal year is insufficient to pay the full amounts that the outlying areas are eligible to receive under paragraphs (2) and (3) for that fiscal year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce those amounts.

(5) Uses

Grant funds awarded under paragraph (1)(A) may be used only

(A) for programs described in this chapter, including teacher training, curriculum development, instructional materials, or general school improvement and reform; and

(B) to provide direct educational services that assist all students with meeting the challenging State academic standards.
