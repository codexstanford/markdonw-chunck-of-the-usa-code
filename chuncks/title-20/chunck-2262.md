The Secretary is authorized to award grants to institutions of higher education to establish a modeling and simulation program, including a major, minor, career-track, certificate, or concentration program.

(B) Duration of grant

A grant awarded under this subsection shall be awarded for a three-year period, and such grant period may be extended for not more than two years if the Secretary determines that an eligible institution has demonstrated success in establishing a modeling and simulation degree program at such eligible institution.

(C) Minimum grant amount

Subject to the availability of appropriations, a grant awarded to an eligible institution under this subsection shall not be less than $750,000.

(D) Non-Federal share

Each eligible institution receiving a grant under this subsection shall provide, from non-Federal sources, in cash or in-kind, an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount of the grant to carry out the activities supported by the grant.

(A) a letter from the president or provost of the eligible institution that demonstrates the institution’s commitment to the establishment of a modeling and simulation program at the institution of higher education;

(B) a detailed plan for how the grant funds will be used to establish a modeling and simulation program at the institution; and

(C) a description of how the modeling and simulation program established under this subsection will complement existing programs and fit into the institution’s current program and course offerings.
