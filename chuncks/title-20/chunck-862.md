##### (e) Allotments to Predominantly Black Institutions

(1) Federal Pell Grant basis

From the amounts appropriated to carry out this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each Predominantly Black Institution having an application approved under subsection (f) a sum that bears the same ratio to one-half of that amount as the number of Federal Pell Grant recipients in attendance at such institution at the end of the academic year preceding the beginning of that fiscal year, bears to the total number of Federal Pell Grant recipients at all such institutions at the end of such academic year.

(2) Graduates basis

From the amounts appropriated to carry out this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each Predominantly Black Institution having an application approved under subsection (f) a sum that bears the same ratio to one-fourth of that amount as the number of graduates for such academic year at such institution, bears to the total number of graduates for such academic year at all such institutions.

(3) Graduates seeking a higher degree basis

From the amounts appropriated to carry out this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each Predominantly Black Institution having an application approved under subsection (f) a sum that bears the same ratio to one-fourth of that amount as the percentage of graduates from such institution who are admitted to and in attendance at, not later than two years after graduation with an associate’s degree or a baccalaureate degree, a baccalaureate degree-granting institution or a graduate or professional school in a degree program in disciplines in which Black American students are underrepresented, bears to the percentage of such graduates for all such institutions.

(4) Minimum allotment

(A) In general

Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), the amount allotted to each Predominantly Black Institution under this section may not be less than $250,000.

(B) Insufficient amount

If the amounts appropriated to carry out this section for a fiscal year are not sufficient to pay the minimum allotment provided under subparagraph (A) for the fiscal year, then the amount of such minimum allotment shall be ratably reduced. If additional sums become available for such fiscal year, such reduced allotment shall be increased on the same basis as the allotment was reduced until the amount allotted equals the minimum allotment required under subparagraph (A).

(5) Reallotment

The amount of a Predominantly Black Institution’s allotment under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) for any fiscal year that the Secretary determines will not be needed for such institution for the period for which such allotment is available, shall be available for reallotment to other Predominantly Black Institutions in proportion to the original allotments to such other institutions under this section for such fiscal year. The Secretary shall reallot such amounts from time to time, on such date and during such period as the Secretary determines appropriate.
