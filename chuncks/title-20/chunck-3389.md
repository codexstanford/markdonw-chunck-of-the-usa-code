#### § 4425. Endowment programs
##### (b) Capital improvement endowment

(1) In addition to the trust fund established under subsection (a), funds may be deposited into a trust fund maintained by the Institute at a federally insured banking or savings institution from the amount reserved for this subsection pursuant to section 4451(a) of this title for the purpose of establishing a separate special endowment for capital improvement (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “capital endowment fund”) to pay expenses associated with site selection and preparation, site planning and architectural design and planning, new construction, materials and equipment procurement, renovation, alteration, repair, and other building and expansion costs of the Institute.

(2) The President of the Institute shall provide for the deposit into the capital endowment fund of a capital contribution by the Institute in an amount equal to the amount of each Federal contribution and any earnings on amounts in the capital endowment fund.

(3) Funds deposited by the Institute as a match for Federal contributions under paragraph (5) shall remain in the capital endowment fund for a period of not less than two years. If at any time the Institute withdraws any capital contribution to the capital endowment fund before the funds have been deposited for this two-year period, an equal amount of the Federal contribution shall be withdrawn from the capital endowment fund and returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. At the end of the two-year period, the entire principal and interest of the funds deposited for this period, including the Federal matching portion, shall accrue, without reservation, to the Institute and may be withdrawn, in whole or in part, to defray expenses associated with capital acquisition and improvement of the Institute referred to in paragraph (1).

(4) For the purpose of complying with the contribution requirement of paragraph (2), the Institute may use funds which are available from any private, non-Federal governmental, or tribal source.

(5) Subject to paragraph (3), amounts appropriated under section 4451(a) of this title for use under this subsection shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Institute as a Federal capital contribution equal to the amount which the Institute demonstrates has been placed within the control of, or irrevocably committed to the use of, the Institute and is available for deposit as a capital contribution of the Institute in accordance with this subsection.

(6) For the purpose of complying with the contribution requirement in this subsection, the Institute may use funds or in-kind contributions of real or personal property. For the purposes of this paragraph, all contributions, in-kind and real estate, which are held by the Institute beginning on November 29, 1990 , and which were received after June 2, 1988 , but which have not been included in their entirety in computations under this section shall be eligible for matching Federal funds appropriated in any year.
