(2) Plan

If, after reviewing the evaluation in paragraph (1), the eligible agency determines that an eligible recipient failed to meet at least 90 percent of an agreed upon local level of performance for any of the core indicators of performance described in section 2323(b)(4) of this title for all CTE concentrators, the eligible recipient shall develop and implement a program improvement plan (that includes an analysis of the performance disparities or gaps identified under section 2323(b)(3)(C)(ii)(II) of this title , and actions that will be taken to address such gaps) in consultation with local stakeholders described in section 2354(d)(1) of this title , the eligible agency, and appropriate agencies, individuals, and organizations during the first program year succeeding the program year for which the eligible recipient failed to so meet any of the local levels of performance for any of the core indicators of performance.

(3) Technical assistance

If the eligible agency determines that an eligible recipient is not properly implementing the eligible recipient’s responsibilities under section 2354 of this title , or is not making substantial progress in meeting the purposes of this chapter, based on the local levels of performance, the eligible agency shall work with the eligible recipient to implement improvement activities consistent with the requirements of this chapter.

(4) Subsequent action

(A) In general

The eligible agency may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, withhold from the eligible recipient all, or a portion, of the eligible recipient’s allotment under this subchapter if the eligible recipient

(i) fails to implement an improvement plan as described in paragraph (2); or

(ii) with respect to any specific core indicator of performance that was identified in a program improvement plan under paragraph (2), fails to meet at least 90 percent of the local level of performance for such core indicator for 2 consecutive years after the eligible recipient has been identified for improvement under such paragraph.

(B) Waiver for exceptional circumstances

In determining whether to impose sanctions under subparagraph (A), the eligible agency may waive imposing sanctions

(i) due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the eligible recipient;

(ii) based on the impact on the eligible recipient’s reported performance of the small size of the career and technical education program operated by the eligible recipient; or
