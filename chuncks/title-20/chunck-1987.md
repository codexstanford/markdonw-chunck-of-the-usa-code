##### (a) Grant program authorized

(1) In general

Subject to the availability of funds appropriated to carry out this section, the Secretary shall award program grants to each of the institutions listed in subsection (b)(1) that is determined by the Secretary to be making a substantial contribution to graduate education opportunities at the masters level in mathematics, engineering, the physical or natural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing, allied health, or other scientific disciplines for Black Americans.

(2) Assurance of non-Federal matching funds

No grant in excess of $1,000,000 may be made under this section unless the institution provides assurances that 50 percent of the cost of the purposes for which the grant is made will be paid from non-Federal sources, except that no institution shall be required to match any portion of the first $1,000,000 of the institution’s award from the Secretary. After funds are made available to each eligible institution under the funding rules described in subsection (f), the Secretary shall distribute, on a pro rata basis, any amounts which were not so made available (by reason of the failure of an institution to comply with the matching requirements of this paragraph) among the institutions that have complied with such matching requirement.

(3) Minimum award

Subject to subsections (f) and (g), the amount awarded to each eligible institution listed in subsection (b)(1) for a fiscal year shall be not less than $500,000.

(4) Duration of grants

A grant awarded under this section shall be for a period of not more than six years, but may be periodically renewed for a period to be determined by the Secretary.
