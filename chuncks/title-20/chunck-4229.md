(1) Allocation

(A) In general

Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the Secretary shall award a grant under subsection (a) to a local educational agency eligible under section 7345(b) of this title for a fiscal year in an amount equal to the initial amount determined under paragraph (2) for the fiscal year minus the total amount received by the agency under the provisions of law described in section 7345(c) of this title for the preceding fiscal year.

(B) Special determination

For a local educational agency that is eligible under section 7345(b)(1)(C) of this title and is a member of an educational service agency, the Secretary may determine the award amount by subtracting from the initial amount determined under paragraph (2), an amount that is equal to that local educational agency’s per-pupil share of the total amount received by the educational service agency under the provisions described in section 7345(c) of this title , as long as a determination under this subparagraph would not disproportionately affect any State.

(2) Determination of initial amount

(A) In general

The initial amount referred to in paragraph (1) is equal to $100 multiplied by the total number of students in excess of 50 students, in average daily attendance at the schools served by the local educational agency, plus $20,000, except that the initial amount may not exceed $60,000.

(B) Special rule

For any fiscal year for which the amount made available to carry out this part is $265,000,000 or more, subparagraph (A) shall be applied

(i) by substituting “$25,000” for “$20,000”; and

(ii) by substituting “$80,000” for “$60,000”.

(3) Ratable adjustment

(A) In general

If the amount made available to carry out this section for any fiscal year is not sufficient to pay in full the amounts that local educational agencies are eligible to receive under paragraph (1) for such year, the Secretary shall ratably reduce such amounts for such year.

(B) Additional amounts

If additional funds become available for making payments under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year, payments that were reduced under subparagraph (A) shall be increased on the same basis as such payments were reduced.

(4) Hold harmless

For a local educational agency that is not eligible under this subpart due to amendments made by the Every Student Succeeds Act to section 7345(b)(1)(A)(ii) of this title but met the eligibility requirements under section 7345(b) of this title as such section was in effect on the day before December 10, 2015 , the agency shall receive
