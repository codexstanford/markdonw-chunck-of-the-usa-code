### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1161v. Modeling and simulation
##### (c) Enhancing modeling and simulation at institutions of higher education

(1) Enhancement grants authorized

(A) In general

The Secretary is authorized to award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible institutions to enhance modeling and simulation degree programs at such eligible institutions.

(B) Duration of grant

A grant awarded under this subsection shall be awarded for a three-year period, and such grant period may be extended for not more than two years if the Secretary determines that an eligible institution has demonstrated success in enhancing the modeling and simulation degree program at such eligible institution.

(C) Minimum grant amount

Subject to the availability of appropriations, a grant awarded to an eligible institution under this subsection shall not be less than $750,000.

(D) Non-Federal share

Each eligible institution receiving a grant under this subsection shall provide, from non-Federal sources, in cash or in-kind, an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount of the grant to carry out the activities supported by the grant. The Secretary may waive the non-Federal share requirement under this subparagraph for an eligible institution if the Secretary determines a waiver to be appropriate based on the financial ability of the institution.

(2) Eligible institutions

For the purposes of this subsection, an eligible institution is an institution of higher education that

(A) has an established modeling and simulation degree program, including a major, minor, or career-track program; or

(B) has an established modeling and simulation certificate or concentration program.

(3) Application

To be considered for a grant under this subsection, an eligible institution shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. Such application shall include

(A) a letter from the president or provost of the eligible institution that demonstrates the institution’s commitment to the enhancement of the modeling and simulation program at the institution of higher education;

(B) an identification of designated faculty responsible for the enhancement of the institution’s modeling and simulation program; and

(C) a detailed plan for how the grant funds will be used to enhance the modeling and simulation program of the institution.

(4) Uses of funds

A grant awarded under this subsection shall be used by an eligible institution to carry out the plan developed in accordance with paragraph (3)(C) to enhance modeling and simulation programs at the institution, which may include

(A) in the case of an institution that is eligible under paragraph (2)(B), activities to assist in the establishment of a major, minor, or career-track modeling and simulation program at the eligible institution;

(B) expanding the multidisciplinary nature of the institution’s modeling and simulation programs;

(C) recruiting students into the field of modeling and simulation through the provision of fellowships or assistantships;

(D) creating new courses to complement existing courses and reflect emerging developments in the modeling and simulation field;

(E) conducting research to support new methodologies and techniques in modeling and simulation; and

(F) purchasing equipment necessary for modeling and simulation programs.
