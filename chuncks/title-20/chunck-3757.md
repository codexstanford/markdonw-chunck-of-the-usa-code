### CHAPTER 70— STRENGTHENING AND IMPROVEMENT OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS
#### § 6333. Basic grants to local educational agencies
##### (a) Amount of grants

(1) Grants for local educational agencies and Puerto Rico

Except as provided in paragraph (4) and in section 6338 of this title , the grant that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this section for a fiscal year is the amount determined by multiplying

(A) the number of children counted under subsection (c); and

(B) 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the State, except that the amount determined under this subparagraph shall not be less than 32 percent, or more than 48 percent, of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.

(2) Calculation of grants

(A) Allocations to local educational agencies

The Secretary shall calculate grants under this section on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) for local educational agencies, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that some or all of those data are unreliable or that their use would be otherwise inappropriate, in which case

(i) the two Secretaries shall publicly disclose the reasons for their determination in detail; and

(ii) paragraph (3) shall apply.

(B) Allocations to large and small local educational agencies

(i) For any fiscal year to which this paragraph applies, the Secretary shall calculate grants under this section for each local educational agency.

(ii) The amount of a grant under this section for each large local educational agency shall be the amount determined under clause (i).

(iii) For small local educational agencies, the State educational agency may either

(I) distribute grants under this section in amounts determined by the Secretary under clause (i); or

(II) use an alternative method approved by the Secretary to distribute the portion of the State’s total grants under this section that is based on those small agencies.

(iv) An alternative method under clause (iii)(II) shall be based on population data that the State educational agency determines best reflect the current distribution of children in poor families among the State’s small local educational agencies that meet the eligibility criteria of subsection (b).

(v) If a small local educational agency is dissatisfied with the determination of its grant by the State educational agency under clause (iii)(II), it may appeal that determination to the Secretary, who shall respond not later than 45 days after receipt of such appeal.

(vi) As used in this subparagraph

(I) the term “large local educational agency” means a local educational agency serving an area with a total population of 20,000 or more; and

(II) the term “small local educational agency” means a local educational agency serving an area with a total population of less than 20,000.

(3) Allocations to counties

(A) Calculation

For any fiscal year to which this paragraph applies, the Secretary shall calculate grants under this section on the basis of the number of children counted under subsection (c) for counties, and State educational agencies shall suballocate county amounts to local educational agencies, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.

(B) Direct allocations

In any State in which a large number of local educational agencies overlap county boundaries, or for which the State believes it has data that would better target funds than allocating them by county, the State educational agency may apply to the Secretary for authority to make the allocations under this subpart for a particular fiscal year directly to local educational agencies without regard to counties.

(C) Allocations to local educational agencies

If the Secretary approves the State educational agency’s application under subparagraph (B), the State educational agency shall provide the Secretary an assurance that such allocations shall be made

(i) using precisely the same factors for determining a grant as are used under this subpart; or

(ii) using data that the State educational agency submits to the Secretary for approval that more accurately target poverty.

(D) Appeal

The State educational agency shall provide the Secretary an assurance that it will establish a procedure through which a local educational agency that is dissatisfied with its determinations under subparagraph (B) may appeal directly to the Secretary for a final determination.

(4) Puerto Rico

(A) In general

For each fiscal year, the grant that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall be eligible to receive under this section shall be the amount determined by multiplying the number of children counted under subsection (c) for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by the product of

(i) subject to subparagraph (B), the percentage that the average per-pupil expenditure in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average per-pupil expenditure of any of the 50 States; and

(ii) 32 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in the United States.

(B) Minimum percentage

The percentage in subparagraph (A)(i) shall not be less than

(i) for fiscal year 2002, 77.5 percent;

(ii) for fiscal year 2003, 80.0 percent;

(iii) for fiscal year 2004, 82.5 percent;

(iv) for fiscal year 2005, 85.0 percent;

(v) for fiscal year 2006, 92.5 percent; and

(vi) for fiscal year 2007 and succeeding fiscal years, 100.0 percent.

(C) Limitation

If the application of subparagraph (B) would result in any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia receiving less under this subpart than it received under this subpart for the preceding fiscal year, the percentage in subparagraph (A) shall be the greater of

(i) the percentage in subparagraph (A)(i);

(ii) the percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for the preceding fiscal year; or

(iii) the percentage used for the preceding fiscal year.
