### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1087e. Terms and conditions of loans
##### (q) Eligibility for, and interest charges on, Federal Direct Stafford Loans for new borrowers on or after July 1, 2013

(1) In general

Notwithstanding subsection (a) or any other provision of this subchapter, any borrower who was a new borrower on or after July 1, 2013 , shall not be eligible for a Federal Direct Stafford Loan if the period of time for which the borrower has received Federal Direct Stafford Loans, in the aggregate, exceeds the period of enrollment described in paragraph (3). Such borrower may still receive any Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan for which such borrower is otherwise eligible.

(2) Accrual of interest on Federal Direct Stafford Loans

Notwithstanding subsection (f)(1)(A) or any other provision of this subchapter and beginning on the date upon which a borrower who is enrolled in a program of education or training (including a course of study or program described in paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of section 1091(b) of this title ) for which borrowers are otherwise eligible to receive Federal Direct Stafford Loans, becomes ineligible for such loan as a result of paragraph (1), interest on all Federal Direct Stafford Loans that were disbursed to such borrower on or after July 1, 2013 , shall accrue. Such interest shall be paid or capitalized in the same manner as interest on a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan is paid or capitalized under section 1078–8(e)(2) of this title .

(3) Period of enrollment

(A) In general

The aggregate period of enrollment referred to in paragraph (1) shall not exceed the lesser of

(i) a period equal to 150 percent of the published length of the educational program in which the student is enrolled; or

(ii) in the case of a borrower who was previously enrolled in one or more other educational programs that began on or after July 1, 2013 , and subject to subparagraph (B), a period of time equal to the difference between

(I) 150 percent of the published length of the longest educational program in which the borrower was, or is, enrolled; and

(II) any periods of enrollment in which the borrower received a Federal Direct Stafford Loan.

(B) Regulations

The Secretary shall specify in regulation

(i) how the aggregate period described in subparagraph (A) shall be calculated with respect to a borrower who was or is enrolled on less than a full-time basis; and

(ii) how such aggregate period shall be calculated to include a course of study or program described in paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of section 1091(b) of this title , respectively.
