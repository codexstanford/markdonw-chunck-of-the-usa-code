#### § 1072. Advances for reserve funds of State and nonprofit private loan insurance programs
##### (b) Limitations on total advances

(1) In general

The total of the advances from the sums appropriated pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of section 1071(b) of this title to nonprofit private institutions and organizations for the benefit of students in any State and to such State may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of such State aged 18 to 22, inclusive, bears to the population of all the States aged 18 to 22 inclusive, but such advances may otherwise be in such amounts as the Secretary determines will best achieve the purposes for which they are made. The amount available for advances to any State shall not be less than $25,000 and any additional funds needed to meet this requirement shall be derived by proportionately reducing (but not below $25,000) the amount available for advances to each of the remaining States.

(2) Calculation of population

For the purpose of this subsection, the population aged 18 to 22, inclusive, of each State and of all the States shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data available to him.
