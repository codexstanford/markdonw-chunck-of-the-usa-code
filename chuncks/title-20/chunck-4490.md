#### § 7881. Participation by private school children and teachers
##### (c) Consultation

(1) In general

To ensure timely and meaningful consultation, a State educational agency, local educational agency, educational service agency, consortium of those agencies, or entity shall consult with appropriate private school officials. Such agency and private school officials shall both have the goal of reaching agreement on how to provide equitable and effective programs for eligible private school children, on issues such as

(A) how the children’s needs will be identified;

(B) what services will be offered;

(C) how, where, and by whom the services will be provided;

(D) how the services will be assessed and how the results of the assessment will be used to improve those services;

(E) the size and scope of the equitable services to be provided to the eligible private school children, teachers, and other educational personnel, the amount of funds available for those services, and how that amount is determined;

(F) how and when the agency, consortium, or entity will make decisions about the delivery of services, including a thorough consideration and analysis of the views of the private school officials on the provision of services through potential third-party providers; and

(G) whether the agency, consortium, or entity shall provide services directly or through a separate government agency, consortium, or entity, or through a third-party contractor; and

(H) whether to provide equitable services to eligible private school children

(i) by creating a pool or pools of funds with all of the funds allocated under subsection (a)(4)(C) based on all the children from low-income families in a participating school attendance area who attend private schools; or

(ii) in the agency’s participating school attendance area who attend private schools with the proportion of funds allocated under subsection (a)(4)(C) based on the number of children from low-income families who attend private schools.

(2) Disagreement

If the agency, consortium, or entity disagrees with the views of the private school officials on the provision of services through a contract, the agency, consortium, or entity shall provide to the private school officials a written explanation of the reasons why the local educational agency has chosen not to use a contractor.

(3) Timing

The consultation required by paragraph (1) shall occur before the agency, consortium, or entity makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school children, teachers, and other educational personnel to participate in programs under this chapter, and shall continue throughout the implementation and assessment of activities under this section.

(4) Discussion required

The consultation required by paragraph (1) shall include a discussion of service delivery mechanisms that the agency, consortium, or entity could use to provide equitable services to eligible private school children, teachers, administrators, and other staff.

(5) Documentation

Each local educational agency shall maintain in the agency’s records, and provide to the State educational agency involved, a written affirmation signed by officials of each participating private school that the meaningful consultation required by this section has occurred. The written affirmation shall provide the option for private school officials to indicate such officials’ belief that timely and meaningful consultation has not occurred or that the program design is not equitable with respect to eligible private school children. If such officials do not provide such affirmation within a reasonable period of time, the local educational agency shall forward the documentation that such consultation has, or attempts at such consultation have, taken place to the State educational agency.

(6) Compliance

(A) In general

If the consultation required under this section is with a local educational agency or educational service agency, a private school official shall have the right to file a complaint with the State educational agency that the consultation required under this section was not meaningful and timely, did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official, or did not make a decision that treats the private school or its students equitably as required by this section.

(B) Procedure

If the private school official wishes to file a complaint, the private school official shall provide the basis of the noncompliance and all parties shall provide the appropriate documentation to the appropriate officials.

(C) Services

A State educational agency shall provide services under this section directly or through contracts with public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions, if the appropriate private school officials have

(i) requested that the State educational agency provide such services directly; and

(ii) demonstrated that the local educational agency involved has not met the requirements of this section in accordance with the procedures for making such a request, as prescribed by the State educational agency.
