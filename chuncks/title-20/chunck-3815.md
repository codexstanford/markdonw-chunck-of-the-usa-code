(2) develop and implement a procedure for monitoring the accuracy of such information;

(3) develop and implement a procedure for more accurately reflecting cost factors for different types of summer and intersession program designs;

(4) adjust the number of migratory children who reside in each State to take into account

(A) the unique needs of those children participating in effective special programs provided under this part that operate during the summer and intersession periods; and

(B) the additional costs of operating such programs; and
