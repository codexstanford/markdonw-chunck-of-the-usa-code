##### (q) Lender-of-last-resort

(1) Action at request of Secretary

(A) Whenever the Secretary determines that eligible borrowers are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under this part, the Association or its designated agent shall, not later than 90 days after August 10, 1993 , begin making loans to such eligible borrowers in accordance with this subsection at the request of the Secretary. The Secretary may request that the Association make loans to borrowers within a geographic area or for the benefit of students attending institutions of higher education that certify, in accordance with standards established by the Secretary, that their students are seeking and unable to obtain loans.

(B) Loans made pursuant to this subsection shall be insurable by the Secretary under section 1079 of this title with a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage provided for under section 1079(b)(1) of this title or by a guaranty agency under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.

(2) Issuance and coverage of loans

(A) Whenever the Secretary, after consultation with, and with the agreement of, representatives of the guaranty agency in a State, or an eligible lender in a State described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) of this title , determines that a substantial portion of eligible borrowers in such State or within an area of such State are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under this part, the Association or its designated agent shall begin making such loans to borrowers in such State or within an area of such State in accordance with this subsection at the request of the Secretary.

(B) Loans made pursuant to this subsection shall be insurable by the agency identified in subparagraph (A) having an agreement pursuant to section 1078(b) of this title . For loans insured by such agency, the agency shall provide the Association with a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage, if the Association and the agency have mutually agreed upon a means to determine that the agency has not already guaranteed a loan under this part to a student which would cause a subsequent loan made by the Association to be in violation of any provision under this part.

(3) Termination of lending

The Association or its designated agent shall cease making loans under this subsection at such time as the Secretary determines that the conditions which caused the implementation of this subsection have ceased to exist.
