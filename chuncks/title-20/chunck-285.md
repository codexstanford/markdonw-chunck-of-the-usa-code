#### § 80u. National Museum of the American Latino
##### (a) Findings

Congress finds the following:

(1) The United States is a symbol of democracy, freedom, and economic opportunity around the world, and the legacy of Latinos is deeply rooted in the very fabric of the history, democracy, freedom, and economic opportunity of the United States.

(2) There exists no national museum within the Smithsonian Institution that is devoted to the documentation and explication of Latino life, art, history, and culture.

(3) The establishment of the National Museum of the American Latino will be consistent with the purposes of the Smithsonian Institution, created by Congress in 1846, “for the increase and diffusion of knowledge”.

(4) The National Museum of the American Latino

(A) will be the keystone for people in the United States and other Smithsonian Institution visitors to learn about Latino contributions to life, art, history, and culture in the United States at its signature location on the National Mall; and

(B) will serve as a gateway for visitors to view other Latino exhibitions, collections, and programming at other Smithsonian Institution facilities and museums throughout the United States and the territories of the United States.
