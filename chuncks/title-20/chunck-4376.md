##### (a) Computation of payment

(1) In general

For the purpose of computing the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b) or (d) for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the number of children who were in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding school year and who, while in attendance at such schools

(A)

(i) resided on Federal property with a parent employed on Federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the school district of such agency; or

(ii) resided on Federal property with a parent who is an official of, and accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer;

(B) resided on Federal property and had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined in section 101 of title 37 );

(C) resided on Indian lands;

(D)

(i) had a parent on active duty in the uniformed services (as defined by section 101 of title 37 ) but did not reside on Federal property; or

(ii) had a parent who is an official of, and has been accredited by, a foreign government and is a foreign military officer but did not reside on Federal property;

(E) resided in low-rent housing;

(F) resided on Federal property and is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or

(G) resided with a parent employed on Federal property situated

(i) in whole or in part in the county in which such agency is located, or in whole or in part in such agency if such agency is located in more than one county; or

(ii) if not in such county, in whole or in part in the same State as such agency.

(2) Determination of weighted student units

For the purpose of computing the basic support payment under subsection (b), the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for a local educational agency by adding together the results obtained by the following computations:

(A) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of 1.0.

(B) Multiply the number of children described in paragraph (1)(C) by a factor of 1.25.

(C) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .35 if the local educational agency has

(i) a number of such children described in such subparagraphs which exceeds 5,000; and

(ii) an average daily attendance for all children which exceeds 100,000.

(D) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .20.

(E) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .10.

(F) Multiply the number of children described in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of paragraph (1) by a factor of .05.

(3) Special rule

The Secretary shall only compute a payment for a local educational agency for children described in subparagraph (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) if the number of such children equals or exceeds 1,000 or such number equals or exceeds 10 percent of the total number of students in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency.

(4) Military installation and Indian housing undergoing renovation or rebuilding

(A) Military installation housing

Beginning in fiscal year 2014, in determining the amount of a payment for a local educational agency for children described in paragraph (1)(D)(i), the Secretary shall consider those children as if they were children described in paragraph (1)(B) if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of Defense, that those children would have resided in housing on Federal property if the housing was not undergoing renovation or rebuilding. The total number of children treated as children described in paragraph (1)(B) shall not exceed the lessor of

(i) the total number of children eligible under paragraph (1)(B) for the year prior to the initiation of the housing project on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding; or

(ii) the total number of Federally connected children enrolled at the local educational agency as stated in the application filed for the payment for the year for which the determination is made.

(B) Indian lands

Beginning in fiscal year 2014, in determining the amount of a payment for a local educational agency that received a payment for children that resided on Indian lands in accordance with paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is making an application, the Secretary shall consider those children to be children described in paragraph (1)(C) if the Secretary determines on the basis of a certification provided to the Secretary by a designated representative of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that those children would have resided in housing on Indian lands if the housing was not undergoing renovation or rebuilding. The total number of children treated as children described in paragraph (1)(C) shall not exceed the lessor of

(i) the total number of children eligible under paragraph (1)(C) for the year prior to the initiation of the housing project on Indian lands undergoing renovation or rebuilding; or

(ii) the total number of Federally connected children enrolled at the local educational agency as stated in the application filed for the payment for the year for which the determination is made.

(C) Eligible housing

Renovation or rebuilding shall be defined as projects considered as capitalization, modernization, or restoration, as defined by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the Interior (as the case may be) and are projects that last more than 30 days, but do not include “sustainment projects” such as painting, carpeting, or minor repairs.

(5) Military “Build to Lease” program housing

(A) In general

For purposes of computing the amount of payment for a local educational agency for children identified under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider children residing in housing initially acquired or constructed under the former section 2828(g) of title 10 (commonly known as the “Build to Lease” program), as added by section 801 of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1984, or under lease of off-base property under subchapter IV of chapter 169 of title 10, to be children described under paragraph (1)(B), if the property described is

(i) within the fenced security perimeter of the military facility; or

(ii) attached to, and under any type of force protection agreement with, the military installation upon which such housing is situated.

(B) Additional requirements

If the property described in subparagraph (A) is not owned by the Federal Government, is subject to taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, and thereby generates revenues for a local educational agency that is applying to receive a payment under this section, then the Secretary

(i) shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and

(ii) shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.
