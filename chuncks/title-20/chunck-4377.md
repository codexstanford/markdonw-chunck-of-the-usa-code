#### § 7703. Payments for eligible federally connected children
##### (b) Basic support payments; insufficient appropriations; State with only one local educational agency

(1) Basic support payments

(A) In general

From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a).

(B) Eligibility

A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of

(i) at least 400 such children; or

(ii) a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.

(C) Maximum amount

The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2), multiplied by the greater of

(i) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;

(ii) one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;

(iii) the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1994 ; or

(iv) the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located, multiplied by the local contribution percentage.

(D) Data

If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for any of the expenditures described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall use data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.

(E) Increase in local contribution rate due to unusual geographic factors

If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subparagraph (C) are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency under subparagraph (C)(iii) by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.

(F) Beginning with fiscal year 2002, for the purpose of calculating a payment under this paragraph for a local educational agency whose local contribution rate was computed under subparagraph (C)(iii) for the previous year, the Secretary shall use a local contribution rate that is not less than 95 percent of the rate that the LEA received for the preceding year.

(2) Basic support payments for heavily impacted local educational agencies

(A) In general

(i) From the amount appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to make basic support payments to eligible heavily impacted local educational agencies with children described in subsection (a).

(ii) Loss of eligibility

(I) In general

Subject to subclause (II), a heavily impacted local educational agency that met the requirements of clause (i) for a fiscal year shall be ineligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) if the agency fails to meet the requirements of clause (i) for a subsequent fiscal year, except that such agency shall continue to receive a basic support payment under this paragraph for the fiscal year for which the ineligibility determination is made.

(II) Loss of eligibility due to falling below 95 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes

In the case of a heavily impacted local educational agency described in subclause (II) or (V) of clause (i) that is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A), but that has had, for 2 consecutive fiscal years, a tax rate for general fund purposes that falls below 95 percent of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State, such agency shall be determined to be ineligible under clause (i) and ineligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for each fiscal year succeeding such 2 consecutive fiscal years for which the agency has such a tax rate for general fund purposes, and until the fiscal year for which the agency resumes such eligibility in accordance with clause (iii).

(III) Taken over by State board of education

In the case of a heavily impacted local educational agency that is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A), but that has been taken over by a State board of education in any 2 previous years, such agency shall be deemed to maintain heavily impacted status for 2 fiscal years following December 10, 2015 .

(iii) Eligibility

(I) First time

A local educational agency seeking a payment under this paragraph for the first time shall apply for and be determined eligible under clause (i) for 2 consecutive years before receiving such a payment, and shall not receive such a payment for the first year of eligibility.

(II) Resumption of eligibility

A heavily impacted local educational agency described in clause (i) that becomes ineligible under such clause for 1 or more fiscal years may resume eligibility for a basic support payment under this paragraph for a subsequent fiscal year only if the agency meets the requirements of clause (i) for that subsequent fiscal year, except that such agency shall not receive a basic support payment under this paragraph until the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which the eligibility determination is made.

(C) Maximum amount for heavily impacted local educational agencies

(i) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the maximum amount that a heavily impacted local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) and subject to clause (ii), multiplied by the greater of

(I) four-fifths of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made; or

(II) four-fifths of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

(ii) Calculation of weighted student units

(I) In general

(aa) Percentage enrollment

For a local educational agency in which 35 percent or more of the total student enrollment of the schools of the agency are children described in subparagraph (D) or (E) (or a combination thereof) of subsection (a)(1), and that has an enrollment of children described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of such subsection equal to at least 10 percent of the agency’s total enrollment, the Secretary shall calculate the weighted student units of those children described in subparagraph (D) or (E) of such subsection by multiplying the number of such children by a factor of 0.55.

(bb) Exception

Notwithstanding item (aa), a local educational agency that received a payment under this paragraph for fiscal year 2013 shall not be required to have an enrollment of children described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (a)(1) equal to at least 10 percent of the agency’s total enrollment and shall be eligible for the student weight as provided for in item (aa).

(II) Enrollment of 100 or fewer children

For a local educational agency that has an enrollment of 100 or fewer children described in subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for purposes of subsection (a)(2) by multiplying the number of such children by a factor of 1.75.

(III) Enrollment of more than 100 children but less than 1000

For a local educational agency that is not described under subparagraph (B)(i)(I) and has an enrollment of more than 100 but not more than 1,000 children described in subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall calculate the total number of weighted student units for purposes of subsection (a)(2) by multiplying the number of such children by a factor of 1.25.

(D) Maximum amount for large heavily impacted local educational agencies

(i) In general

(I) Formula

Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), the maximum amount that a heavily impacted local educational agency described in subclause (II) is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with the formula described in paragraph (1)(C).

(II) Heavily impacted local educational agency

A heavily impacted local educational agency described in this subclause is a local educational agency that received a payment for fiscal year 2015 under section 7703(b)(2)(E)  1 of this title (as such section was in effect for such fiscal year) and has a total student enrollment of not less than 25,000 students, of which not less than 35 percent are children described in subsection (a)(1) and

(aa) not less than 3,500 of such children are children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1); or

(bb) not less than 7,000 of such children are children described in subparagraph (D) of subsection (a)(1).

(ii) Factor

For purposes of calculating the maximum amount described in clause (i), the factor used in determining the weighted student units under subsection (a)(2) with respect to children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) shall be

(I) for fiscal year 2016, 1.35;

(II) for each of fiscal years 2017 and 2018, 1.38;

(III) for fiscal year 2019, 1.40;

(IV) for fiscal year 2020, 1.42; and

(V) for fiscal year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, 1.45.

(iii) Factor for children who live off base

(bb) .25 with respect to the number of children that exceeds 7,000.

(iv) Special rule

Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii), for fiscal year 2020 or any succeeding fiscal year, if the number of students who are children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) for a local educational agency subject to this subparagraph exceeds 7,000 for such year or the number of students who are children described in subsection (a)(1)(D) for such local educational agency exceeds 12,750 for such year, then

(I) the factor used, for the fiscal year for which the determination is being made, to determine the weighted student units under subsection (a)(2) with respect to children described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) shall be 1.40; and

(II) the factor used, for such fiscal year, to determine the weighted student units under subsection (a)(2) with respect to children described in subsection (a)(1)(D) shall be .20.

(E) Data

For purposes of providing assistance under this paragraph, the Secretary shall use student, revenue, expenditure, and tax data from the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the local educational agency is applying for assistance under this paragraph.

(F) Determination of average tax rates for general fund purposes

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), for the purpose of determining the average tax rates for general fund purposes for local educational agencies in a State under this paragraph, the Secretary shall use either

(I) the average tax rate for general fund purposes for comparable local educational agencies, as determined by the Secretary in regulations; or

(II) the average tax rate of all the local educational agencies in the State.

(ii) Fiscal years 2010–2015

(I) In general

For fiscal years 2010 through 2015, any local educational agency that was found ineligible to receive a payment under subparagraph (A) because the Secretary determined that it failed to meet the average tax rate requirement for general fund purposes in subparagraph (B)(i)(II)(cc), shall be considered to have met that requirement, if its State determined, through an alternate calculation of average tax rates for general fund purposes, that such local educational agency met that requirement.

(II) Subsequent fiscal years after 2015

For any succeeding fiscal year after 2015, any local educational agency identified in subclause (I) may continue to have its State use that alternate methodology to calculate whether the average tax rate requirement for general fund purposes under subparagraph (B)(i)(II)(cc) is met.

(III) Availability of funds

Notwithstanding any other provision of law limiting the period during which the Secretary may obligate funds appropriated for any fiscal year after 2012, the Secretary shall reserve a total of $14,000,000 from funds that remain unobligated under this section from fiscal years 2015 or 2016 in order to make payments under this clause for fiscal years 2011 through 2014.

(G) Eligibility for heavily impacted local educational agencies affected by privatization of military housing

(i) Eligibility

For any fiscal year, a heavily impacted local educational agency that received a basic support payment under this paragraph for the prior fiscal year, but is ineligible for such payment for the current fiscal year under subparagraph (B) due to the conversion of military housing units to private housing described in clause (iii), or as the direct result of base realignment and closure or modularization as determined by the Secretary of Defense and force structure change or force relocation, shall be deemed to meet the eligibility requirements under subparagraph (B) for the period during which the housing units are undergoing such conversion or during such time as activities associated with base closure and realignment, modularization, force structure change, or force relocation are ongoing.

(ii) Amount of payment

The amount of a payment to a heavily impacted local educational agency for a fiscal year by reason of the application of clause (i), and calculated in accordance with subparagraph (C) or (D), as the case may be, shall be based on the number of children in average daily attendance in the schools of such agency for the fiscal year and under the same provisions of subparagraph (C) or (D) under which the agency was paid during the prior fiscal year.

(iii) Conversion of military housing units to private housing described

For purposes of clause (i), “conversion of military housing units to private housing” means the conversion of military housing units to private housing units pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 169 of title 10 or pursuant to any other related provision of law.

(3) Payments with respect to fiscal years in which insufficient funds are appropriated

(A) In general

For any fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under section 7714(b) of this title are insufficient to pay to each local educational agency the full amount computed under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with this paragraph.

(B) Learning opportunity threshold payments in lieu of payments under paragraph (1)

(i) For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall compute a learning opportunity threshold payment (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the “threshold payment”) in lieu of basic support payments under paragraph (1) by multiplying the amount obtained under paragraph (1)(C) by the total percentage obtained by adding

(I) the percentage of federally connected children for each local educational agency determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of children described under subsection (a)(1) and the denominator of which is the total number of children in average daily attendance at the schools served by such agency; and

(II) the percentage that funds under paragraph (1)(C) represent of the total budget of the local educational agency, determined by calculating the fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of funds calculated for each local educational agency under this paragraph, and the denominator of which is the total current expenditures for such agency in the second preceding fiscal year for which the determination is made.

(ii) Such total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 100.

(iii) In the case of a local educational agency providing a free public education to students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12, that enrolls students described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (a)(1) only in grades 9 through 12, and that received a final payment for fiscal year 2009 calculated under section 7703(b)(3) of this title (as such section was in effect on the day before December 10, 2015 ) for students in grades 9 through 12, the Secretary shall, in calculating the agency’s payment, consider only that portion of such agency’s total enrollment of students in grades 9 through 12 when calculating the percentage under clause (i)(I) and only that portion of the total current expenditures attributed to the operation of grades 9 through 12 in such agency when calculating the percentage under clause (i)(II).

(iv) In the case of a local educational agency that has a total student enrollment of fewer than 1,000 students and that has a per-pupil expenditure that is less than the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the agency is located or less than the average per-pupil expenditure of all the States, the total percentage used to calculate threshold payments under clause (i) shall not be less than 40 percent.

(C) Learning opportunity threshold payments in lieu of payments under paragraph (2)

For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), the learning opportunity threshold payment in lieu of basic support payments under paragraph (2) shall be equal to the amount obtained under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2), as the case may be.

(D) Ratable distribution

For fiscal years described in subparagraph (A), for which the sums available exceed the amount required to pay each local educational agency 100 percent of its threshold payment, the Secretary shall distribute the excess sums to each eligible local educational agency that has not received its full amount computed under paragraphs (1) or (2) (as the case may be) by multiplying

(i) a percentage, the denominator of which is the difference between the full amount computed under paragraph (1) or (2) (as the case may be) for all local educational agencies and the amount of the threshold payment (as calculated under subparagraphs (B) and (C)) of all local educational agencies, and the numerator of which is the aggregate of the excess sums, by

(ii) the difference between the full amount computed under paragraph (1) or (2) (as the case may be) for the agency and the amount of the threshold payment (as calculated under subparagraphs (B) or (C)) of the agency, except that no local educational agency shall receive more than 100 percent of the maximum payment calculated under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2).

(E) Insufficient payments

For each fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) for which the sums appropriated are insufficient to pay each local educational agency all of the local educational agency’s threshold payment described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each local educational agency under this paragraph.

(F) Increases

(i) Increases based on insufficient funds

If additional funds become available under 7714(b) of this title for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) and those funds are not sufficient to increase each local educational agency’s threshold payment above 100 percent of its threshold payment described in subparagraph (B), payments that were reduced under subparagraph (E) shall be increased by the Secretary on the same basis as such payments were reduced.

(ii) Increases based on sufficient funds

If additional funds become available under section 7714(b) of this title for making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) and those funds are sufficient to increase each local educational agency’s threshold payment above 100 percent of its threshold payment described in subparagraph (B), the payment for each local educational agency shall be 100 percent of its threshold payment. The Secretary shall then distribute the excess sums to each eligible local educational agency in accordance with subparagraph (D).

(G) Provision of tax rate and resulting percentage

As soon as practicable following the payment of funds under paragraph (2) to an eligible local educational agency, the Secretary shall provide the local educational agency with a description of

(i) the tax rate of the local educational agency; and

(ii) the percentage such tax rate represents of the average tax rate for general fund purposes of comparable local educational agencies in the State as determined under subclauses (II)(cc), III(aa), or (V)(bb) of paragraph (2)(B)(i) (as the case may be).

(4) States with only one local educational agency

(A) In general

In any of the 50 States of the United States in which there is only one local educational agency, the Secretary shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) or subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2), as the case may be, paragraph (3) of this subsection, and subsection (e), consider each administrative school district in the State to be a separate local educational agency.

(B) Computation of maximum amount of basic support payment and threshold payment

In computing the maximum payment amount under paragraph (1)(C) or subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2), as the case may be, and the learning opportunity threshold payment under subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3), as the case may be, for an administrative school district described in subparagraph (A)

(i) the Secretary shall first determine the maximum payment amount and the total current expenditures for the State as a whole; and

(ii) the Secretary shall then

(I) proportionately allocate such maximum payment amount among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective weighted student units of such districts; and

(II) proportionately allocate such total current expenditures among the administrative school districts on the basis of the respective number of students in average daily attendance at such districts.

(5) Local educational agencies affected by removal of Federal property

(A) In general

In computing the amount of a basic support payment under this subsection for a fiscal year for a local educational agency described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall meet the additional requirements described in subparagraph (C).

(B) Local educational agency described

A local educational agency described in this subparagraph is a local educational agency with respect to which Federal property (i) located within the boundaries of the agency, and (ii) on which one or more children reside who are receiving a free public education at a school of the agency, is transferred by the Federal Government to another entity in any fiscal year beginning on or after October 30, 2000 , so that the property is subject to taxation by the State or a political subdivision of the State.

(C) Additional requirements

The additional requirements described in this subparagraph are the following:

(i) For each fiscal year beginning after the date on which the Federal property is transferred, a child described in subparagraph (B) who continues to reside on such property and who continues to receive a free public education at a school of the agency shall be deemed to be a child who resides on Federal property for purposes of computing under the applicable subparagraph of subsection (a)(1) the amount that the agency is eligible to receive under this subsection.

(ii)

(I) For the third fiscal year beginning after the date on which the Federal property is transferred, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary shall, after computing the amount that the agency is otherwise eligible to receive under this subsection for the fiscal year involved, deduct from such amount an amount equal to the revenue received by the agency for the immediately preceding fiscal year as a result of the taxable status of the former Federal property.

(II) For purposes of determining the amount of revenue to be deducted in accordance with subclause (I), the local educational agency

(aa) shall provide for a review and certification of such amount by an appropriate local tax authority; and

(bb) shall submit to the Secretary a report containing the amount certified under item (aa).
