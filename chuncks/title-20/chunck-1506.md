#### § 1087bb. Allocation of funds
##### (i) Reallocation of excess allocations

(1) In general

(A) If an institution of higher education returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institution under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall reallocate 80 percent of such returned portions to participating institutions in an amount not to exceed such participating institution’s excess eligible amounts as determined under paragraph (2).

(B) For the purpose of this subsection, the term “participating institution” means an institution of higher education that

(i) was a participant in the program assisted under this part in fiscal year 1999; and

(ii) did not receive an allocation under subsection (a) in the fiscal year for which the reallocation determination is made.

(2) Excess eligible amount

For any participating institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which

(A)

(i) that institution’s eligible amount (as determined under subsection (b)(3)), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible amounts of all participating institutions (as determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by (iii) the amount of funds available for reallocation under this subsection; exceeds

(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (b).

(3) Remainder

The Secretary shall reallocate the remainder of such returned portions in accordance with regulations of the Secretary.

(4) Allocation reductions

If under paragraph (1) of this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution’s allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing it is contrary to the interest of the program.
