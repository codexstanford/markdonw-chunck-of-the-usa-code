#### § 1078–7. Requirements for disbursement of student loans
##### (d) Withholding of second disbursement

(1) Withdrawing students

A lender or escrow agent that is informed by the borrower or the institution that the borrower has ceased to be enrolled before the disbursement of the second or any succeeding installment shall withhold such disbursement. Any disbursement which is so withheld shall be credited to the borrower’s loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.

(2) Students receiving over-awards

If the sum of a disbursement for any student and the other financial aid obtained by such student exceeds the amount of assistance for which the student is eligible under this subchapter, the institution such student is attending shall withhold and return to the lender or escrow agent the portion (or all) of such installment that exceeds such eligible amount, except that overawards permitted pursuant to section 1087–53(b)(4) of this title shall not be construed to be overawards for purposes of this paragraph. Any portion (or all) of a disbursement installment which is so returned shall be credited to the borrower’s loan and treated as a prepayment thereon.
