##### (h) Debt obligations

(1) Approval by Secretaries of Education and the Treasury

The Association is authorized with the approval of the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury to issue and have outstanding obligations having such maturities and bearing such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the Association. The authority of the Secretary of Education to approve the issuance of such obligations is limited to obligations issued by the Association and guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such obligations may be redeemable at the option of the Association before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated therein. The Secretary of the Treasury may not direct as a condition of his approval that any such issuance of obligations by the Association be made or sold to the Federal Financing Bank. To the extent that the average outstanding amount of the obligations owned by the Association pursuant to the authority contained in subsection (d)(1)(B) and (C) of this section and as to which the income is exempt from taxation under title 26 does not exceed the average stockholders’ equity of the Association, the interest on obligations issued under this paragraph shall not be deemed to be interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations for the purpose of section 265 of title 26 .

(2) Guarantee of debt

The Secretary is authorized, prior to October 1, 1984 , to guarantee payment when due of principal and interest on obligations issued by the Association in an aggregate amount determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to authorize the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the Treasury to limit, control, or constrain programs of the Association or support of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program by the Association.

(3) Borrowing authority to meet guarantee obligations

To enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities under guarantees issued by him, he is authorized to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the months preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as may be necessary to pay the principal and interest on the notes or obligations issued by him to the Secretary of the Treasury.

(4) Action on request for guarantees

Upon receipt of a request from the Association under this subsection requiring approvals by the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the Treasury shall act promptly either to grant approval or to advise the Association of the reasons for withholding approval. In no case shall such an approval be withheld for a period longer than 60 days unless, prior to the end of such period, the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury submit to the Congress a detailed explanation of reasons for doing so.

(5) Authority of Treasury to purchase debt

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations issued by the Association pursuant to this subsection as now or hereafter in force, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this subsection if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater than $1,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities as of the last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.

(6) Sale of debt to Federal Financing Bank

Notwithstanding any other provision of law the Association is authorized to sell or issue obligations on the security of student loans, the payment of interest or principal of which has at any time been guaranteed under section 1078 or 1079 of this title, to the Federal Financing Bank.

(7) Offset fee

(A) The Association shall pay to the Secretary, on a monthly basis, an offset fee calculated on an annual basis in an amount equal to 0.30 percent of the principal amount of each loan made, insured or guaranteed under this part that the Association holds (except for loans made pursuant to section 1078–3 of this title , subsection ( o ), or subsection (q)) and that was acquired on or after August 10, 1993 .

(B) If the Secretary determines that the Association has substantially failed to comply with subsection (q), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “1.0 percent” for “0.3 percent”.

(C) The Secretary shall deposit all fees collected pursuant to this paragraph into the insurance fund established in section 1081 of this title .
