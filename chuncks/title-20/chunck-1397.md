(1) In general

Except as specifically provided in this section, until the dissolution date the Association shall continue to have all of the rights, privileges and obligations set forth in, and shall be subject to all of the limitations and restrictions of, section 1087–2 of this title , and the Association shall continue to carry out the purposes of such section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association) shall not be entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and obligations, and shall not be subject to the limitations and restrictions, applicable to the Association under section 1087–2 of this title , except as specifically provided in this section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association or a subsidiary of the Association) shall not purchase loans insured under this chapter until such time as the Association ceases acquiring such loans, except that the Holding Company may purchase such loans if the Association is merely continuing to acquire loans as a lender of last resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title or under an agreement with the Secretary described in paragraph (6).

(2) Transfer of certain property

(A) In general

Except as provided in this section, on the reorganization effective date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Association shall use the Association’s best efforts to transfer to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company (or both), as directed by the Holding Company, all real and personal property of the Association (both tangible and intangible) other than the remaining property. Subject to the preceding sentence, such transferred property shall include all right, title, and interest in

(i) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Association (excluding special purpose funding companies in existence on September 30, 1996 , and any interest in any government-sponsored enterprise);

(ii) contracts, leases, and other agreements of the Association;

(iii) licenses and other intellectual property of the Association; and

(iv) any other property of the Association.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the Association from transferring remaining property from time to time to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4).

(3) Transfer of personnel

On the reorganization effective date, employees of the Association shall become employees of the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company), and the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company) shall provide all necessary and appropriate management and operational support (including loan servicing) to the Association, as requested by the Association. The Association, however, may obtain such management and operational support from persons or entities not associated with the Holding Company.

(4) Dividends

The Association may pay dividends in the form of cash or noncash distributions so long as at the time of the declaration of such dividends, after giving effect to the payment of such dividends as of the date of such declaration by the Board of Directors of the Association, the Association’s capital would be in compliance with the capital standards and requirements set forth in section 1087–2(r) of this title . If, at any time after the reorganization effective date, the Association fails to comply with such capital standards, the Holding Company shall transfer with due diligence to the Association additional capital in such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the Association again complies with the capital standards.

(5) Certification prior to dividend

Prior to the payment of any dividend under paragraph (4), the Association shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the payment of the dividend will be made in compliance with paragraph (4) and shall provide copies of all calculations needed to make such certification.

After the reorganization effective date, the Association shall not engage in any new business activities or acquire any additional program assets described in section 1087–2(d) of this title other than in connection with

(i) student loan purchases through September 30, 2007 ;

(ii) contractual commitments for future warehousing advances, or pursuant to letters of credit or standby bond purchase agreements, which are outstanding as of the reorganization effective date;

(iii) the Association serving as a lender-of-last-resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title ; and

(iv) the Association’s purchase of loans insured under this part, if the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, enters into an agreement with the Association for the continuation or resumption of the Association’s secondary market purchase program because the Secretary determines there is inadequate liquidity for loans made under this part.

(B) Agreement

The Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement described in clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) with the Association covering such secondary market activities. Any agreement entered into under such clause shall cover a period of 12 months, but may be renewed if the Secretary determines that liquidity remains inadequate. The fee provided under section 1087–2(h)(7) of this title shall not apply to loans acquired under any such agreement with the Secretary.

(7) Issuance of debt obligations during the transition period; attributes of debt obligations

After the reorganization effective date, the Association shall not issue debt obligations which mature later than September 30, 2008 , except in connection with serving as a lender-of-last-resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title or with purchasing loans under an agreement with the Secretary as described in paragraph (6). Nothing in this section shall modify the attributes accorded the debt obligations of the Association by section 1087–2 of this title , regardless of whether such debt obligations are incurred prior to, or at any time following, the reorganization effective date or are transferred to a trust in accordance with subsection (d).

(ii) the Association’s policies, procedures, and systems for monitoring and controlling any such financial risk.

(B) Summary reports

The Secretary of the Treasury may require summary reports of the information described in subparagraph (A) to be filed no more frequently than quarterly. If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports provided pursuant to this subparagraph or other available information, the Secretary of the Treasury has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of the Association, the Secretary of the Treasury may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence and subparagraph (A), require the Association to make reports concerning the activities of any associated person whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the Association.
