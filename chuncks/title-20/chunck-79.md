(1) In general

The Board may procure insurance against any loss in connection with the property of the Board and other assets administered by the Board. Each employee and volunteer of the Board shall be considered to be a civil employee of the United States (within the meaning of the term “employee” as defined in section 8101(1) of title 5 ), except that the Board shall continue to provide benefits with respect to any disability or death resulting from a personal injury to a nonappropriated fund employee of the Board sustained while in the performance of the duties of the employee for the Board pursuant to the workers compensation statute of the jurisdiction in which the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is located. The disability or death benefits referred to in the preceding sentence, whether under the workers compensation statute referred to in the preceding sentence or under chapter 81 of title 5, shall continue to be the exclusive liability of the Board and the United States with respect to all employees and volunteers of the Board.

(2) Federal tort claims

For the purposes of chapter 171 of title 28, an employee of the Board shall be considered to be an “employee of the government” and the Board shall be considered to be a “Federal agency”. No employee of the Board may bring suit against the United States or the Board under the Federal tort claims procedure of chapter 171 of title 28 for disability or death resulting from personal injury sustained while in the performance of the duties of the employee for the Board.
