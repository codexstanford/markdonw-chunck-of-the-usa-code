### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1011k. Recovery of payments
##### (a) Public benefit

Congress declares that, if a facility constructed with the aid of a grant under part A of subchapter VII as such part A was in effect prior to October 7, 1998 , or part B of such subchapter as part B was in effect prior to July 23, 1992 , is used as an academic facility for 20 years following completion of such construction, the public benefit accruing to the United States will equal in value the amount of the grant. The period of 20 years after completion of such construction shall therefore be deemed to be the period of Federal interest in such facility for the purposes of such subchapter as so in effect.
