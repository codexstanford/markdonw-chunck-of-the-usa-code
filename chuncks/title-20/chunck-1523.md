#### § 1087dd. Terms of loans
##### (f) Special repayment rule authority

(1) Subject to such restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe to protect the interest of the United States, in order to encourage repayment of loans made under this part which are in default, the Secretary may, in the agreement entered into under this part, authorize an institution of higher education to compromise on the repayment of such defaulted loans in accordance with paragraph (2). The Federal share of the compromise repayment shall bear the same relation to the institution’s share of such compromise repayment as the Federal capital contribution to the institution’s loan fund under this part bears to the institution’s capital contribution to such fund.

(2) No compromise repayment of a defaulted loan as authorized by paragraph (1) may be made unless the student borrower pays

(A) 90 percent of the loan under this part;

(B) the interest due on such loan; and

(C) any collection fees due on such loan; in a lump sum payment.
