#### § 1018a. Procurement flexibility
##### (g) Modular contracting

(1) In general

The PBO may satisfy the requirements of the PBO for a system incrementally by carrying out successive procurements of modules of the system. In doing so, the PBO may use procedures authorized under this subsection to procure any such module after the first module.

(2) Utility requirement

A module may not be procured for a system under this subsection unless the module is useful independently of the other modules or useful in combination with another module previously procured for the system.

(3) Conditions for use of authority

The PBO may use procedures authorized under paragraph (4) for the procurement of an additional module for a system if

(A) competitive procedures were used for awarding the contract for the procurement of the first module for the system; and

(B) the solicitation for the first module included

(i) a general description of the entire system that was sufficient to provide potential offerors with reasonable notice of the general scope of future modules;

(ii) other information sufficient for potential offerors to make informed business judgments regarding whether to submit offers for the contract for the first module; and

(iii) a statement that procedures authorized under this subsection could be used for awarding subsequent contracts for the procurement of additional modules for the system.

(4) Procedures

If the procurement of the first module for a system meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (3), the PBO may award a contract for the procurement of an additional module for the system using any of the following procedures:

(A) Single-source basis

Award of the contract on a single-source basis to a contractor who was awarded a contract for a module previously procured for the system under competitive procedures or procedures authorized under subparagraph (B).

(B) Adequate competition

Award of the contract on the basis of offers made by

(i) a contractor who was awarded a contract for a module previously procured for the system after having been selected for award of the contract under this subparagraph or other competitive procedures; and

(ii) at least one other offeror that submitted an offer for a module previously procured for the system and is expected, on the basis of the offer for the previously procured module, to submit a competitive offer for the additional module.

(C) Other

Award of the contract under any other procedure authorized by law.

(5) Notice requirement

(A) Publication

Not less than 30 days before issuing a solicitation for offers for a contract for a module for a system under procedures authorized under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (4), the PBO shall publish in the Commerce Business Daily a notice of the intent to use such procedures to enter into the contract.

(B) Exception

Publication of a notice is not required under this paragraph with respect to a use of procedures authorized under paragraph (4) if the contractor referred to in that subparagraph (who is to be solicited to submit an offer) has previously provided a module for the system under a contract that contained cost, schedule, and performance goals and the contractor met those goals.

(C) Content of notice

A notice published under subparagraph (A) with respect to a use of procedures described in paragraph (4) shall contain the information required under section 1708(c) of title 41 , other than paragraph (4) of such section, and shall invite the submission of any assertion that the use of the procedures for the procurement involved is not in the best interest of the Federal Government together with information supporting the assertion.

(6) Documentation

The basis for an award of a contract under this subsection shall be documented. However, a justification pursuant to section 3304(e) of title 41 or section 637(h) of title 15 is not required.

(7) Simplified source-selection procedures

The PBO may award a contract under any other simplified procedures prescribed by the PBO for the selection of sources for the procurement of modules for a system, after the first module, that are not to be procured under a contract awarded on a single-source basis.
