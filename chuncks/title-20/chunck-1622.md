### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1090. Forms and regulations
##### (e) Early application and estimated award demonstration program

(1) Purpose and objectives

The purpose of the demonstration program under this subsection is to measure the benefits, in terms of student aspirations and plans to attend an institution of higher education, and any adverse effects, in terms of program costs, integrity, distribution, and delivery of aid under this subchapter, of implementing an early application system for all dependent students that allows dependent students to apply for financial aid using information from two years prior to the year of enrollment. Additional objectives associated with implementation of the demonstration program are the following:

(B) To identify whether receiving final financial aid award estimates not later than the fall of the senior year of secondary school provides students with additional time to compete for the limited resources available for State and institutional financial aid and positively impacts the college aspirations and plans of these students.

(C) To measure the impact of using income information from the years prior to enrollment on

(i) eligibility for financial aid under this subchapter and for other State and institutional aid; and

(ii) the cost of financial aid programs under this subchapter.
