##### (b) Amount

(1) In general

(A)

(i)

(I) Subject to subclauses (II) and (III), the amount that a local educational agency shall be paid under subsection (a) for a fiscal year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2).

(II) Except as provided in subclause (III), the Secretary may not reduce the amount of a payment under this section to a local educational agency for a fiscal year by (aa) the amount equal to the amount of revenue, if any, the agency received during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property eligible under this section and located in a school district served by the agency, including amounts received from any Federal department or agency (other than the Department of Education) from such activities, by reason of receipt of such revenue, or (bb) any other amount by reason of receipt of such revenue.

(III) If the amount equal to the sum of (aa) the proposed payment under this section to a local educational agency for a fiscal year and (bb) the amount of revenue described in subclause (II)(aa) received by the agency during the previous fiscal year, exceeds the maximum amount the agency is eligible to receive under this section for the fiscal year involved, then the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the proposed payment under this section by an amount equal to such excess amount.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the amount of revenue that a local educational agency receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property shall not include payments received by the agency from the Secretary of Defense to support

(I) the operation of a domestic dependent elementary or secondary school; or

(II) the provision of a free public education to dependents of members of the Armed Forces residing on or near a military installation.

(B) If funds appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title are insufficient to pay the amount determined under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall calculate the payment for each eligible local educational agency in accordance with subsection (h).

(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a local educational agency may not be paid an amount under this section that, when added to the amount such agency receives under section 7703(b) of this title , exceeds the maximum amount that such agency is eligible to receive for such fiscal year under section 7703(b)(1)(C) of this title , or the maximum amount that such agency is eligible to receive for such fiscal year under this section, whichever is greater.

(2) Application of current levied real property tax rate

In calculating the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall apply the current levied real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent local educational agencies, or imputed for fiscally dependent local educational agencies, to the current annually determined estimated taxable value of such acquired Federal property.

(3) Determination of taxable value for eligible Federal property

(A) In general

In determining the estimated taxable value of such acquired Federal property for fiscal year 2010 and each succeeding fiscal year, the Secretary shall

(i) first determine the total taxable value for the purpose of levying property tax for school purposes for current expenditures of real property located within the boundaries of such local educational agency;

(ii) then determine the per acre value of the eligible Federal property by dividing the total taxable value as determined in clause (i) by the difference between the total acres located within the boundaries of the local educational agency and the number of Federal acres eligible under this section; and

(iii) then determine the total taxable value of the eligible Federal property by multiplying the per acre value as calculated under clause (ii) by the number of Federal acres eligible under this section.

(B) Special rule

In the case of Federal property eligible under this section that is within the boundaries of 2 or more local educational agencies that are eligible under this section, any of such agencies may ask the Secretary to calculate (and the Secretary shall calculate) the taxable value of the eligible Federal property that is within its boundaries by

(i) first calculating the per-acre value of the eligible Federal property separately for each eligible local educational agency that shared the Federal property, as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii);

(ii) then averaging the resulting per-acre values of the eligible Federal property from each eligible local educational agency that shares the Federal property; and

(iii) then applying the average per-acre value to determine the total taxable value of the eligible Federal property under subparagraph (A)(iii) for the requesting local educational agency.
