##### (d) Student success grant pilot program

(1) Definitions

(A) Eligible institution

In this subsection, the term “eligible institution” means an institution of higher education in which, during the three-year period preceding the year in which the institution is applying for a grant under this subsection, an average of not less than 50 percent of the institution’s entering first-year students are assessed as needing developmental courses to bring reading, writing, or mathematics skills up to college level.

(B) Eligible student

In this subsection, the term “eligible student” means a student who

(i) is eligible to receive assistance under section 1070a of this title ;

(ii) is a first-year student at the time of entering the program;

(iii) is assessed as needing developmental education to bring reading, writing, or mathematics skills up to college level; and

(iv) is selected by an eligible institution to participate in the program.

(2) Student success grant amount

The Secretary shall award grants under this subsection to eligible institutions in an amount equal to $1,500 multiplied by the number of students the institution selects to participate in the program in such year. An institution shall not select more than 200 students to participate in the program under this subsection during such year.

(3) Required uses

An eligible institution that receives a grant under this subsection shall use the grant funds to assign a student success coach to each first-year student participating in the program to provide intensive career and academic advising, ongoing personal help in navigating college services (such as financial aid and registration), and assistance in connecting to community resources that can help students overcome family and personal challenges to success. Student success coaches

(A) shall work with not more than 50 new students during any academic period;

(B) may be employees of academic departments, student services offices, community-based organizations, or other entities as determined appropriate by the institution; and

(C) shall meet with each eligible student selected for the program before registration for courses.

(4) Allowable uses

An eligible institution that receives a grant under this subsection may use the grant funds to provide services and program innovations for students participating in the program, including the following:

(A) College and career success courses provided at no charge to participating students. These courses may cover college success topics, including how to take notes, how to study, how to take tests, and how to budget time, and may also include a substantial career exploration component. Institutions may use such courses to help students develop a college and career success plan, so that by the end of the first semester the students have a clear sense of their career goals and what classes to take to achieve such goals.

(B) Work-study jobs with private employers in the students’ fields of study.

(C) Learning communities that ensure that students participating in the program are clustered together for at least two courses beginning in the first semester after enrolling and have other opportunities to create and maintain bonds that allow them to provide academic and social support to each other.

(D) Curricular redesign, which may include such innovations as blended or accelerated remediation classes that help student success grant recipients to attain college-level reading, writing, or math skills (or a combination thereof) more rapidly than traditional remediation formats allow, and intensive skills refresher classes, offered prior to each semester, to help students who have tested into remedial coursework to reach entry level assessment scores for the postsecondary programs they wish to enter.

(E) Instructional support, such as learning labs, supplemental instruction, and tutoring.

(F) Assistance with support services, such as child care and transportation.

(5) Required non-Federal share

Each institution participating in the program under this subsection shall provide a non-Federal share of 25 percent of the amount of the grant to carry out the activities of the program. The non-Federal share under this subsection may be provided in cash or in kind.
