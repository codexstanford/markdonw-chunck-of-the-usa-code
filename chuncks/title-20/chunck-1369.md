#### § 1087–1. Special allowances
##### (a) Findings

In order to assure (1) that the limitation on interest payments or other conditions (or both) on loans made or insured under this part, do not impede or threaten to impede the carrying out of the purposes of this part or do not cause the return to holders of loans to be less than equitable, (2) that incentive payments on such loans are paid promptly to eligible lenders, and (3) that appropriate consideration of relative administrative costs and money market conditions is made in setting the quarterly rate of such payments, the Congress finds it necessary to establish an improved method for the determination of the quarterly rate of the special allowances on such loans, and to provide for a thorough, expeditious, and objective examination of alternative methods for the determination of the quarterly rate of such allowances.
