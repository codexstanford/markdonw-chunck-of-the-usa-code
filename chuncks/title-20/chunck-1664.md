(A) exclude from the reporting requirements under paragraphs (1) and (2) the completion or graduation rates of students and student athletes who leave school to serve in the Armed Forces, on official church missions, or with a recognized foreign aid service of the Federal Government; or

(B) in cases where the students described in subparagraph (A) represent 20 percent or more of the certificate- or degree-seeking, full-time, undergraduate students at the institution, calculate the completion or graduation rates of such students by excluding from the calculations described in paragraph (1) the time period during which such students were not enrolled due to their service in the Armed Forces, on official church missions, or with a recognized foreign aid service of the Federal Government.

(4) Each institution of higher education described in paragraph (1) may provide supplemental information to students and the Secretary showing the completion or graduation rate when such completion or graduation rate includes students transferring into and out of such institution.

(5) The Secretary, using the reports submitted under this subsection, shall compile and publish a report containing the information required under paragraph (1) broken down by

(A) individual institutions of higher education; and

(B) athletic conferences recognized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.

(6) The Secretary shall waive the requirements of this subsection for any institution of higher education that is a member of an athletic association or athletic conference that has voluntarily published completion or graduation rate data or has agreed to publish data that, in the opinion of the Secretary, is substantially comparable to the information required under this subsection.

(7) The Secretary, in conjunction with the National Junior College Athletic Association, shall develop and obtain data on completion or graduation rates from two-year colleges that award athletically related student aid. Such data shall, to the extent practicable, be consistent with the reporting requirements set forth in this section.

(8) For purposes of this subsection, the term “athletically related student aid” means any scholarship, grant, or other form of financial assistance the terms of which require the recipient to participate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at an institution of higher education in order to be eligible to receive such assistance.

(9) The reports required by this subsection shall be due each July 1 and shall cover the 1-year period ending August 31 of the preceding year.
