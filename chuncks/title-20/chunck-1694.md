##### (a) All like loans treated as one

To the extent practicable, and with the cooperation of the borrower, eligible lenders shall treat all loans made to a borrower under the same section of part B as one loan and shall submit one bill to the borrower for the repayment of all such loans for the monthly or other similar period of repayment.
