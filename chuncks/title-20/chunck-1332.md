#### § 1082. Legal powers and responsibilities
##### (g) Civil penalties

(1) Authority to impose penalties

Upon determination, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a lender or a guaranty agency

(A) has violated or failed to carry out any provision of this part or any regulation prescribed under this part, or

(B) has engaged in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its financial charges, the Secretary may impose a civil penalty upon such lender or agency of not to exceed $25,000 for each violation, failure, or misrepresentation.

(2) Limitations

No civil penalty may be imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the Secretary determines that

(A) the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation referred to in that paragraph resulted from a violation, failure, or misrepresentation that is material; and

(B) the lender or guaranty agency knew or should have known that its actions violated or failed to carry out the provisions of this part or the regulations thereunder.

(3) Correction of failure

A lender or guaranty agency has no liability under paragraph (1) of this subsection if, prior to notification by the Secretary under that paragraph, the lender or guaranty agency cures or corrects the violation or failure or notifies the person who received the substantial misrepresentation of the actual nature of the financial charges involved.

(4) Consideration as single violation

For the purpose of paragraph (1) of this subsection, violations, failures, or substantial misrepresentations arising from a specific practice of a lender or guaranty agency, and occurring prior to notification by the Secretary under that paragraph, shall be deemed to be a single violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation even if the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation affects more than one loan or more than one borrower, or both. The Secretary may only impose a single civil penalty for each such violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation.

(5) Assignees not liable for violations by others

If a loan affected by a violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation is assigned to another holder, the lender or guaranty agency responsible for the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation shall remain liable for any civil money penalty provided for under paragraph (1) of this subsection, but the assignee shall not be liable for any such civil money penalty.

(6) Compromise

Until a matter is referred to the Attorney General, any civil penalty under paragraph (1) of this subsection may be compromised by the Secretary. In determining the amount of such penalty, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, the Secretary shall consider the appropriateness of the penalty to the resources of the lender or guaranty agency subject to the determination; the gravity of the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation; the frequency and persistence of the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation; and the amount of any losses resulting from the violation, failure, or substantial misrepresentation. The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the lender or agency charged, unless the lender or agency has, in the case of a final agency determination, commenced proceedings for judicial review within 90 days of the determination, in which case the deduction may not be made during the pendency of the proceeding.
