### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1101. Findings; purpose; and program authority
##### (a) Findings

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Hispanic Americans are at high risk of not enrolling or graduating from institutions of higher education.

(2) Disparities between the enrollment of non-Hispanic white students and Hispanic students in postsecondary education are increasing. Between 1973 and 1994, enrollment of white secondary school graduates in 4-year institutions of higher education increased at a rate two times higher than that of Hispanic secondary school graduates.

(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, Hispanic-serving institutions provide a significant proportion of postsecondary opportunities for Hispanic students.

(4) Relative to other institutions of higher education, Hispanic-serving institutions are underfunded. Such institutions receive significantly less in State and local funding, per full-time equivalent student, than other institutions of higher education.

(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are succeeding in educating Hispanic students despite significant resource problems that

(A) limit the ability of such institutions to expand and improve the academic programs of such institutions; and

(B) could imperil the financial and administrative stability of such institutions.

(6) There is a national interest in remedying the disparities described in paragraphs (2) and (4) and ensuring that Hispanic students have an equal opportunity to pursue postsecondary opportunities.
