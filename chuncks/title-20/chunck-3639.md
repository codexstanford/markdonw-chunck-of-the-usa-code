### CHAPTER 68— NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM
#### § 6062. Funding for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [ 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;

(2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and

(3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
