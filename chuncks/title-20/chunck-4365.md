##### (a) In general

Where the Secretary, after consultation with any local educational agency and with the appropriate State educational agency, determines

(1) that the United States owns Federal property in the local educational agency, and that such property

(A) has been acquired by the United States since 1938;

(B) was not acquired by exchange for other Federal property in the local educational agency which the United States owned before 1939; and

(C) had an assessed value according to original records (including facsimiles or other reproductions of those records) documenting the assessed value of such property (determined as of the time or times when so acquired) prepared by the local officials referred to in subsection (b)(3) or, when such original records are not available due to unintentional destruction (such as natural disaster, fire, flooding, pest infestation, or deterioration due to age), other records, including Federal agency records, local historical records, or other records that the Secretary determines to be appropriate and reliable, aggregating 10 percent or more of the assessed value of

(i) all real property in the local educational agency (similarly determined as of the time or times when such Federal property was so acquired); or

(ii) all real property in the local educational agency as assessed in the first year preceding or succeeding acquisition, whichever is greater, only if

(I) the assessment of all real property in the local educational agency is not made at the same time or times that such Federal property was so acquired and assessed; and

(II) State law requires an assessment be made of property so acquired; and

(2) that such agency is not being substantially compensated for the loss in revenue resulting from such ownership by increases in revenue accruing to the agency from the conduct of Federal activities with respect to such Federal property, then such agency shall be eligible to receive the amount described in subsection (b) or (h).
