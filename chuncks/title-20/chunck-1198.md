#### § 1072. Advances for reserve funds of State and nonprofit private loan insurance programs
##### (h) Recall of reserves; limitations on use of reserve funds and assets

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, recall $1,000,000,000 from the reserve funds held by guaranty agencies on September 1, 2002 .

(2) Deposit

Funds recalled by the Secretary under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury.

(3) Required share

The Secretary shall require each guaranty agency to return reserve funds under paragraph (1) based on the agency’s required share of recalled reserve funds held by guaranty agencies as of September 30, 1996 . For purposes of this paragraph, a guaranty agency’s required share of recalled reserve funds shall be determined as follows:

(A) The Secretary shall compute each guaranty agency’s reserve ratio by dividing (i) the amount held in the agency’s reserve funds as of September 30, 1996 (but reflecting later accounting or auditing adjustments approved by the Secretary), by (ii) the original principal amount of all loans for which the agency has an outstanding insurance obligation as of such date, including amounts of outstanding loans transferred to the agency from another guaranty agency.

(B) If the reserve ratio of any guaranty agency as computed under subparagraph (A) exceeds 2.0 percent, the agency’s required share shall include so much of the amounts held in the agency’s reserve funds as exceed a reserve ratio of 2.0 percent.

(C) If any additional amount is required to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency’s reserve funds remaining after deduction of the amount recalled under subparagraph (B), except that such percentage reduction under this subparagraph shall not result in the agency’s reserve ratio being reduced below 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be the percentage obtained by dividing

(i) the additional amount required to be recalled (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraph (B)), by

(ii) the total amount of all such agencies’ reserve funds remaining (after deduction of the required shares calculated under such subparagraph).

(D) If any additional amount is required to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the total of the required shares calculated under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), such additional amount shall be obtained by imposing on each guaranty agency with a reserve ratio (after deducting the required shares calculated under such subparagraphs) in excess of 0.58 percent an equal percentage reduction in the amount of the agency’s reserve funds remaining (after such deduction) that exceed a reserve ratio of 0.58 percent. The equal percentage reduction shall be the percentage obtained by dividing

(i) the additional amount to be recalled under paragraph (1) (after deducting the amount recalled under subparagraphs (B) and (C)), by

(ii) the total amount of all such agencies’ reserve funds remaining (after deduction of the required shares calculated under such subparagraphs) that exceed a reserve ratio of 0.58 percent.

(4) Restricted accounts required

(A) In general

Within 90 days after the beginning of each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer a portion of the agency’s required share determined under paragraph (3) to a restricted account established by the agency that is of a type selected by the agency with the approval of the Secretary. Funds transferred to such restricted accounts shall be invested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or in other similarly low-risk securities.

(B) Requirement

A guaranty agency shall not use the funds in such a restricted account for any purpose without the express written permission of the Secretary, except that a guaranty agency may use the earnings from such restricted account for default reduction activities.

(C) Installments

In each of fiscal years 1998 through 2002, each guaranty agency shall transfer the agency’s required share to such restricted account in 5 equal annual installments, except that

(i) a guaranty agency that has a reserve ratio (as computed under subparagraph (3)(A)) equal to or less than 1.10 percent may transfer the agency’s required share to such account in 4 equal installments beginning in fiscal year 1999; and

(ii) a guaranty agency may transfer such required share to such account in accordance with such other payment schedules as are approved by the Secretary.

(5) Shortage

If, on September 1, 2002 , the total amount in the restricted accounts described in paragraph (4) is less than the amount the Secretary is required to recall under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall require the return of the amount of the shortage from other reserve funds held by guaranty agencies under procedures established by the Secretary. The Secretary shall first attempt to obtain the amount of such shortage from each guaranty agency that failed to transfer the agency’s required share to the agency’s restricted account in accordance with paragraph (4).

(6) Enforcement

(A) In general

The Secretary may take such reasonable measures, and require such information, as may be necessary to ensure that guaranty agencies comply with the requirements of this subsection.

(B) Prohibition

If the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency has failed to transfer to a restricted account any portion of the agency’s required share under this subsection, the agency may not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary determines that the agency has so transferred the agency’s required share.

(C) Waiver

The Secretary may waive the requirements of subparagraph (B) for a guaranty agency described in such subparagraph if the Secretary determines that there are extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the agency that justify such waiver.

(7) Limitation

(A) Restriction on other authority

The Secretary shall not have any authority to direct a guaranty agency to return reserve funds under subsection (g)(1)(A) during the period from August 5, 1997 , through September 30, 2002 .

(B) Use of termination collections

Any reserve funds directed by the Secretary to be returned to the Secretary under subsection (g)(1)(B) during such period that do not exceed a guaranty agency’s required share of recalled reserve funds under paragraph (3)

(i) shall be used to satisfy the agency’s required share of recalled reserve funds; and

(ii) shall be deposited in the restricted account established by the agency under paragraph (4), without regard to whether such funds exceed the next installment required under such paragraph.

(C) Use of sanctions collections

Any reserve funds directed by the Secretary to be returned to the Secretary under subsection (g)(1)(C) during such period that do not exceed a guaranty agency’s next installment under paragraph (4)

(i) shall be used to satisfy the agency’s next installment; and

(ii) shall be deposited in the restricted account established by the agency under paragraph (4).

(D) Balance available to Secretary

Any reserve funds directed by the Secretary to be returned to the Secretary under subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (g)(1) that remain after satisfaction of the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph shall be deposited in the Treasury.
