### CHAPTER 70— STRENGTHENING AND IMPROVEMENT OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS
#### § 6311. State plans
##### (c) Statewide accountability system

(1) In general

Each State plan shall describe a statewide accountability system that complies with the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d).

(2) Subgroup of students

In this subsection and subsection (d), the term “subgroup of students” means

(A) economically disadvantaged students;

(B) students from major racial and ethnic groups;

(C) children with disabilities; and

(D) English learners.

(3) Minimum number of students

Each State shall describe

(A) with respect to any provisions under this part that require disaggregation of information by each subgroup of students

(i) the minimum number of students that the State determines are necessary to be included to carry out such requirements and how that number is statistically sound, which shall be the same State-determined number for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State;

(ii) how such minimum number of students was determined by the State, including how the State collaborated with teachers, principals, other school leaders, parents, and other stakeholders when determining such minimum number; and

(iii) how the State ensures that such minimum number is sufficient to not reveal any personally identifiable information.

(4) Description of system

The statewide accountability system described in paragraph (1) shall be based on the challenging State academic standards for reading or language arts and mathematics described in subsection (b)(1) to improve student academic achievement and school success. In designing such system to meet the requirements of this part, the State shall carry out the following:

(A) Establishment of long-term goals

Establish ambitious State-designed long-term goals, which shall include measurements of interim progress toward meeting such goals

(i) for all students and separately for each subgroup of students in the State

(I) for, at a minimum, improved

(aa) academic achievement, as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments required under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I); and

(bb) high school graduation rates, including

(AA) the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and

(BB) at the State’s discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, except that the State shall set a more rigorous long-term goal for such graduation rate, as compared to the long-term goal set for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate;

(II) for which the term set by the State for such goals is the same multi-year length of time for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State; and

(III) that, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measures described in items (aa) and (bb) of subclause (I), take into account the improvement necessary on such measures to make significant progress in closing statewide proficiency and graduation rate gaps; and

(ii) for English learners, for increases in the percentage of such students making progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline.

(B) Indicators

Except for the indicator described in clause (iv), annually measure, for all students and separately for each subgroup of students, the following indicators:

(i) For all public schools in the State, based on the long-term goals established under subparagraph (A), academic achievement

(I) as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments required under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I); and

(II) at the State’s discretion, for each public high school in the State, student growth, as measured by such annual assessments.

(ii) For public elementary schools and secondary schools that are not high schools in the State

(I) a measure of student growth, if determined appropriate by the State; or

(II) another valid and reliable statewide academic indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance.

(iii) For public high schools in the State, and based on State-designed long term goals established under subparagraph (A)

(I) the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and

(II) at the State’s discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.

(iv) For public schools in the State, progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline for all English learners

(I) in each of the grades 3 through 8; and

(II) in the grade for which such English learners are otherwise assessed under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I) during the grade 9 through grade 12 period, with such progress being measured against the results of the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G) taken in the previous grade.

(v)

(I) For all public schools in the State, not less than one indicator of school quality or student success that

(aa) allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance;

(bb) is valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide (with the same indicator or indicators used for each grade span, as such term is determined by the State); and

(cc) may include one or more of the measures described in subclause (II).

(II) For purposes of subclause (I), the State may include measures of

(III) 6 student engagement;

(IV) 6 educator engagement;

(V) 6 student access to and completion of advanced coursework;

(VI) 6 postsecondary readiness;

(VII) 6 school climate and safety; and

(VIII) 6 any other indicator the State chooses that meets the requirements of this clause.

(C) Annual meaningful differentiation

Establish a system of meaningfully differentiating, on an annual basis, all public schools in the State, which shall

(i) be based on all indicators in the State’s accountability system under subparagraph (B), for all students and for each of  7 subgroup of students, consistent with the requirements of such subparagraph;

(ii) with respect to the indicators described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (B) afford

(I) substantial weight to each such indicator; and

(II) in the aggregate, much greater weight than is afforded to the indicator or indicators utilized by the State and described in subparagraph (B)(v), in the aggregate; and

(iii) include differentiation of any such school in which any subgroup of students is consistently underperforming, as determined by the State, based on all indicators under subparagraph (B) and the system established under this subparagraph.

(D) Identification of schools

Based on the system of meaningful differentiation described in subparagraph (C), establish a State-determined methodology to identify

(i) beginning with school year 2017–2018, and at least once every three school years thereafter, one statewide category of schools for comprehensive support and improvement, as described in subsection (d)(1), which shall include

(I) not less than the lowest-performing 5 percent of all schools receiving funds under this part in the State;

(II) all public high schools in the State failing to graduate one third or more of their students; and

(III) public schools in the State described under subsection (d)(3)(A)(i)(II); and

(ii) at the discretion of the State, additional statewide categories of schools.

(E) Annual measurement of achievement

(i) Annually measure the achievement of not less than 95 percent of all students, and 95 percent of all students in each subgroup of students, who are enrolled in public schools on the assessments described under subsection (b)(2)(v)(I).

(ii) For the purpose of measuring, calculating, and reporting on the indicator described in subparagraph (B)(i), include in the denominator the greater of

(I) 95 percent of all such students, or 95 percent of all such students in the subgroup, as the case may be; or

(II) the number of students participating in the assessments.

(iii) Provide a clear and understandable explanation of how the State will factor the requirement of clause (i) of this subparagraph into the statewide accountability system.

(F) Partial attendance

(i) In the case of a student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year, the performance of such student on the indicators described in clauses (i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of subparagraph (B)

(I) may not be used in the system of meaningful differentiation of all public schools as described in subparagraph (C) for such school year; and

(II) shall be used for the purpose of reporting on the State and local educational agency report cards under subsection (h) for such school year.

(ii) In the case of a high school student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year and has exited high school without a regular high school diploma and without transferring to another high school that grants a regular high school diploma during such school year, the local educational agency shall, in order to calculate the graduation rate pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), assign such student to the high school

(I) at which such student was enrolled for the greatest proportion of school days while enrolled in grades 9 through 12; or

(II) in which the student was most recently enrolled.

(5) Accountability for charter schools

The accountability provisions under this chapter shall be overseen for charter schools in accordance with State charter school law.
