#### § 1070c–2. Applications for leveraging educational assistance partnership programs
##### (c) Reservation and disbursement of allotments and reallotments

Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students’ incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made. If the Secretary approves an upward revision of such estimated cost, the Secretary may reserve the Federal share of the added cost only from the applicable allotment (or reallotment) available at the time of such approval.
