(ii) directly from the holder of the loan, if the lender fails or is not required to bill the Secretary for interest and special allowance or withdraws from the program with unpaid loan origination fees.

(B) If the Secretary collects the origination fee under this subsection through the reduction of interest and special allowance, and the total amount of interest and special allowance payable under section 1078(a)(3)(A) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, respectively, is less than the amount the lender was authorized to charge borrowers for origination fees in that quarter, the Secretary shall deduct the excess amount from the subsequent quarters’ payments until the total amount has been deducted.

(7) Distribution of origination fees

All origination fees collected pursuant to this section on loans authorized under section 1078–1  1 or 1078–2 of this title shall be paid to the Secretary by the lender and deposited in the fund authorized under section 1081 of this title .
