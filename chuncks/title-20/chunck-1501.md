### CHAPTER 28— HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES AND STUDENT ASSISTANCE
#### § 1087bb. Allocation of funds
##### (e) Default penalties

(1) Years preceding fiscal year 2000

For any fiscal year preceding fiscal year 2000, any institution with a cohort default rate that

(A) equals or exceeds 15 percent, shall establish a default reduction plan pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, except that such plan shall not be required with respect to an institution that has a default rate of less than 20 percent and that has less than 100 students who have loans under this part in such academic year;

(B) equals or exceeds 20 percent, but is less than 25 percent, shall have a default penalty of 0.9;

(C) equals or exceeds 25 percent, but is less than 30 percent, shall have a default penalty of 0.7; and

(D) equals or exceeds 30 percent shall have a default penalty of zero.

(2) Years following fiscal year 2000

For fiscal year 2000 and any succeeding fiscal year, any institution with a cohort default rate (as defined under subsection (g)) that equals or exceeds 25 percent shall have a default penalty of zero.

(3) Ineligibility

(A) In general

For fiscal year 2000 and any succeeding fiscal year, any institution with a cohort default rate (as defined in subsection (g)) that equals or exceeds 50 percent for each of the 3 most recent years for which data are available shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the 2 succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after the submission of the appeal. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if

(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the calculation of the institution’s cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce the institution’s cohort default rate for any of the 3 fiscal years below 50 percent; or

(ii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, such a small number of borrowers entering repayment that the application of this subparagraph would be inequitable.

(B) Continued participation

During an appeal under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part.

(C) Return of funds

Within 90 days after the date of any termination pursuant to subparagraph (A), or the conclusion of any appeal pursuant to subparagraph (B), whichever is later, the balance of the student loan fund established under this part by the institution that is the subject of the termination shall be distributed as follows:

(i) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to such balance (as of the date of such distribution) as the total amount of Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary under this part bears to the sum of such Federal capital contributions and the capital contributions to such fund made by the institution.

(ii) The remainder of such student loan fund shall be paid to the institution.

(D) Use of returned funds

Any funds returned to the Secretary under this paragraph shall be reallocated to institutions of higher education pursuant to subsection (i).

(E) Definition

For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “loss of eligibility” shall be defined as the mandatory liquidation of an institution’s student loan fund, and assignment of the institution’s outstanding loan portfolio to the Secretary.
