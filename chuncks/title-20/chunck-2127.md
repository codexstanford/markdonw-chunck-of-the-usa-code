(1) Authorization

An eligible institution that receives a grant under this section shall use the grant funds to make fellowship awards to minorities and women who are enrolled at such institution in a doctoral degree program, or program for the highest possible degree available, and

(A) intend to pursue a career in instruction at

(i) an institution of higher education (as the term is defined in section 1001 of this title );

(ii) an institution of higher education (as the term is defined in section 1002(a)(1) of this title ); and

(iii) a proprietary institution of higher education (as the term is defined in section 1002(b) of this title ); and

(B) sign an agreement with the Secretary agreeing

(i) to begin employment at an institution described in subparagraph (A) not later than three years after receiving the doctoral degree or highest possible degree available, which three-year period may be extended by the Secretary for extraordinary circumstances; and

(ii) to be employed by such institution for one year for each year of fellowship assistance received under this section.

(2) Repayment for failure to comply

In the event that any recipient of a fellowship under this section fails or refuses to comply with the agreement signed pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), the sum of the amounts of any fellowship received by such recipient shall, upon a determination of such a failure or refusal to comply, be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D of subchapter IV, and shall be subject to repayment, together with interest thereon accruing from the date of the grant award, in accordance with terms and conditions specified by the Secretary in regulations under this section.

(3) Waiver and modification

(A) Regulations

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations setting forth criteria to be considered in granting a waiver for the service requirement under paragraph (1)(B).

(B) Content

The criteria under subparagraph (A) shall include whether compliance with the service requirement by the fellowship recipient would be

(i) inequitable and represent an extraordinary hardship; or

(ii) deemed impossible because the individual is permanently and totally disabled at the time of the waiver request.

(4) Amount of fellowship awards

Fellowship awards under this section shall consist of a stipend in an amount equal to the level of support provided to fellows under the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, except that such stipend shall be adjusted as necessary so as not to exceed the fellow’s tuition and fees or demonstrated need (as determined by the institution of higher education where the graduate student is enrolled), whichever is greater.

(5) Academic progress required

An individual student shall not be eligible to receive a fellowship award

(A) except during periods in which such student is enrolled, and such student is maintaining satisfactory academic progress in, and devoting essentially full time to, study or research in the pursuit of the degree for which the fellowship support was awarded; and

(B) if the student is engaged in gainful employment, other than part-time employment in teaching, research, or similar activity determined by the eligible institution to be consistent with and supportive of the student’s progress toward the appropriate degree.
