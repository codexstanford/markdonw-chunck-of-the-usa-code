##### (c) Required initial evaluation

The Secretary and Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly conduct an evaluation, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Comptroller General, of the pilot program carried out by the Secretary under this section.

(2) the number of lenders that participated in the pilot program, and the extent to which the pilot program generated competition among lenders to participate in the auctions under the pilot program;

(3) the number and volume of loans made under the pilot program in each State;

(4) the effect of the transition to and operation of the pilot program on the ability of

(A) lenders participating in the pilot program to originate loans made through the pilot program smoothly and efficiently;

(B) institutions of higher education participating in the pilot program to disburse loans made through the pilot program smoothly and efficiently; and

(C) parents to obtain loans made through the pilot program in a timely and efficient manner;

(5) the differential impact, if any, of the auction among the States, including between rural and non-rural States; and

(6) the feasibility of using the mechanism piloted to operate the other loan programs under part B of this subchapter.
