##### (c) Hold-harmless amounts

(1) Amounts for sections 6333, 6334, and 6335

For each fiscal year, the amount made available to each local educational agency under each of sections 6333, 6334, and 6335 of this title shall be

(A) not less than 95 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the number of children counted for grants under section 6333 of this title is not less than 30 percent of the total number of children aged 5 to 17 years, inclusive, in the local educational agency;

(B) not less than 90 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the percentage described in subparagraph (A) is between 15 percent and 30 percent; and

(C) not less than 85 percent of the amount made available for the preceding fiscal year if the percentage described in subparagraph (A) is below 15 percent.

(2) Payments

If sufficient funds are appropriated, the amounts described in paragraph (1) shall be paid to all local educational agencies that received grants under section 6334 of this title for the preceding fiscal year, regardless of whether the local educational agency meets the minimum eligibility criteria for that fiscal year described in section 6334(a)(1)(A) of this title except that a local educational agency that does not meet such minimum eligibility criteria for 4 consecutive years shall no longer be eligible to receive a hold harmless amount referred to in paragraph (1).

(3) Applicability

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not take into consideration the hold-harmless provisions of this subsection for any fiscal year for purposes of calculating State or local allocations for the fiscal year under any program administered by the Secretary other than a program authorized under this part.

(4) Population data

For any fiscal year for which the Secretary calculates grants on the basis of population data for counties, the Secretary shall apply the hold-harmless percentages in paragraphs (1) and (2) to counties and, if the Secretary’s allocation for a county is not sufficient to meet the hold-harmless requirements of this subsection for every local educational agency within that county, the State educational agency shall reallocate funds proportionately from all other local educational agencies in the State that are receiving funds in excess of the hold-harmless amounts specified in this subsection.
