From amounts appropriated under subsection (a), the Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, award grants, from allotments under subsection (c), to States (and to philanthropic organization, 1 as appropriate under paragraph (3)) having applications approved under subsection (d), to enable the State (or philanthropic organization) to pay the Federal share of the costs of carrying out the activities and services described in subsection (f).
