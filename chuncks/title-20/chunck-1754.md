(A) Review of current regulations

To meet the requirements of subsection (d)(10), the Advisory Committee shall conduct a review and analysis of the regulations issued by Federal agencies that are in effect at the time of the review and that apply to the operations or activities of institutions of higher education from all sectors. The review and analysis may include a determination of whether the regulation is duplicative, is no longer necessary, is inconsistent with other Federal requirements, or is overly burdensome. In conducting the review, the Advisory Committee shall pay specific attention to evaluating ways in which regulations under this subchapter affecting institutions of higher education (other than institutions described in section 1002(a)(1)(C) of this title ), that have received in each of the two most recent award years prior to August 14, 2008 , less than $200,000 in funds through this subchapter, may be improved, streamlined, or eliminated.

(B) Review and collection of future regulations

The Advisory Committee shall

(i) monitor all Federal regulations, including notices of proposed rulemaking, for their impact or potential impact on higher education; and

(ii) provide a succinct description of each regulation or proposed regulation that is generally relevant to institutions of higher education from all sectors.

(C) Maintenance of public website

The Advisory Committee shall develop and maintain an easy to use, searchable, and regularly updated website that

(i) provides information collected in subparagraph (B);

(ii) provides an area for the experts and members of the public to provide recommendations for ways in which the regulations may be streamlined; and

(iii) publishes the study conducted by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences under section 1106 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act.

(3) Consultation

(A) In general

In carrying out the review, analysis, and development of the website required under paragraph (2), the Advisory Committee shall consult with the Secretary, other Federal agencies, relevant representatives of institutions of higher education, individuals who have expertise and experience with Federal regulations, and the review panels described in subparagraph (B).

(B) Review panels

The Advisory Committee shall convene not less than two review panels of representatives of the groups involved in higher education, including individuals involved in student financial assistance programs under this subchapter, who have experience and expertise in the regulations issued by the Federal Government that affect all sectors of higher education, in order to review the regulations and to provide recommendations to the Advisory Committee with respect to the review and analysis under paragraph (2). The panels shall be made up of experts in areas such as the operations of the financial assistance programs, the institutional eligibility requirements for the financial assistance programs, regulations not directly related to the operations or the institutional eligibility requirements of the financial assistance programs, and regulations for dissemination of information to students about the financial assistance programs.

(4) Periodic updates to the authorizing committees

The Advisory Committee shall

(A) submit, not later than two years after the completion of the negotiated rulemaking process required under section 1098a of this title resulting from the amendments to this chapter made by the Higher Education Opportunity Act, a report to the authorizing committees and the Secretary detailing the review panels’ findings and recommendations with respect to the review of regulations; and

(B) provide periodic updates to the authorizing committees regarding

(i) the impact of all Federal regulations on all sectors of higher education; and

(ii) suggestions provided through the website for streamlining or eliminating duplicative regulations.
