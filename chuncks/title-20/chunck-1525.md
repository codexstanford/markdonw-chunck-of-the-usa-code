(1) Rehabilitation

(A) In general

If the borrower of a loan made under this part who has defaulted on the loan makes 9 on-time, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on the loan, as determined by the institution, or by the Secretary in the case of a loan held by the Secretary, the loan shall be considered rehabilitated, and the institution that made that loan (or the Secretary, in the case of a loan held by the Secretary) shall request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported remove the default from the borrower’s credit history.

(B) Comparable conditions

As long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments on a loan rehabilitated under this paragraph, the rehabilitated loan shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, and qualify for the same benefits and privileges, as other loans made under this part.

(C) Additional assistance

The borrower of a rehabilitated loan shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter (for which the borrower is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such rehabilitation.

(D) Limitations

A borrower only once may obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to rehabilitating a loan under this part.

(2) Restoration of eligibility

If the borrower of a loan made under this part who has defaulted on that loan makes 6 ontime, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on such loan, the borrower’s eligibility for grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter shall be restored to the extent that the borrower is otherwise eligible. A borrower only once may obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to restored eligibility.
