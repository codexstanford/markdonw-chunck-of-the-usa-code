(1) closing the achievement gap between high-performing and low-performing children, especially achievement gaps between minority and nonminority children and between disadvantaged children and such children’s more advantaged peers; and

(2) ensuring

(A) that all children have the ability to obtain a high-quality education (from early childhood through postsecondary education) and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards and State academic assessments, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading or language arts;

(B) access to, and opportunities for, postsecondary education; and

(C) the efficacy, impact on academic achievement, and cost-effectiveness of technology use within the Nation’s schools.
