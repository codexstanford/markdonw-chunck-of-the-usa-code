#### § 7712. Forgiveness of overpayments

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may forgive the obligation of a local educational agency to repay, in whole or in part, the amount of any overpayment received under this subchapter, or under this subchapter’s predecessor authorities, if the Secretary determines that the overpayment was made as a result of an error made by

(1) the Secretary; or

(2) the local educational agency and repayment of the full amount of the overpayment will result in an undue financial hardship on the agency and seriously harm the agency’s educational program.
