##### (h) Suspension of grants for defaults, noncompliance with provisions and plans, and diversion of funds; repayment of funds

Whenever the Chairperson, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, finds that

(1) a group is not complying substantially with the provisions of this section;

(2) a State agency is not complying substantially with the terms and conditions of its State plan approved under this section; or

(3) any funds granted to a group or State agency under this section have been diverted from the purposes for which they were allotted or paid, the Chairperson shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury and the group or State agency with respect to which such finding was made that no further grants will be made under this section to such group or agency until there is no longer any default or failure to comply or the diversion has been corrected, or, if compliance or correction is impossible, until such group or agency repays or arranges the repayment of the Federal funds which have been improperly diverted or expended.
