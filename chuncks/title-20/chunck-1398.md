##### (d) Termination of Association

In the event the shareholders of the Association approve a plan of reorganization under subsection (b), the Association shall dissolve, and the Association’s separate existence shall terminate on September 30, 2008 , after discharge of all outstanding debt obligations and liquidation pursuant to this subsection. The Association may dissolve pursuant to this subsection prior to such date by notifying the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury of the Association’s intention to dissolve, unless within 60 days after receipt of such notice the Secretary of Education notifies the Association that the Association continues to be needed to serve as a lender of last resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title or continues to be needed to purchase loans under an agreement with the Secretary described in subsection (c)(6). On the dissolution date, the Association shall take the following actions:

(1) Establishment of a trust

The Association shall, under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement that is in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Association and the appointed trustee, irrevocably transfer all remaining obligations of the Association to the trust and irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited into such trust, to be held as trust funds solely for the benefit of holders of the remaining obligations, money or direct noncallable obligations of the United States or any agency thereof for which payment the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged, maturing as to principal and interest in such amounts and at such times as are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be sufficient, without consideration of any significant reinvestment of such interest, to pay the principal of, and interest on, the remaining obligations in accordance with their terms. To the extent the Association cannot provide money or qualifying obligations in the amount required, the Holding Company shall be required to transfer money or qualifying obligations to the trust in the amount necessary to prevent any deficiency.

(2) Use of trust assets

All money, obligations, or financial assets deposited into the trust pursuant to this subsection shall be applied by the trustee to the payment of the remaining obligations assumed by the trust.

(3) Obligations not transferred to the trust

The Association shall make proper provision for all other obligations of the Association not transferred to the trust, including the repurchase or redemption, or the making of proper provision for the repurchase or redemption, of any preferred stock of the Association outstanding. Any obligations of the Association which cannot be fully satisfied shall become liabilities of the Holding Company as of the date of dissolution.

(4) Transfer of remaining assets

After compliance with paragraphs (1) and (3), any remaining assets of the trust shall be transferred to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company, as directed by the Holding Company.
