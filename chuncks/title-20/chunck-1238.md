##### (c) Guaranty agreements for reimbursing losses

(1) Authority to enter into agreements

(A) The Secretary may enter into a guaranty agreement with any guaranty agency, whereby the Secretary shall undertake to reimburse it, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish, with respect to losses (resulting from the default of the student borrower) on the unpaid balance of the principal and accrued interest of any insured loan. The guaranty agency shall be deemed to have a contractual right against the United States, during the life of such loan, to receive reimbursement according to the provisions of this subsection. Upon receipt of an accurate and complete request by a guaranty agency for reimbursement with respect to such losses, the Secretary shall pay promptly and without administrative delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and in paragraph (7), the amount to be paid a guaranty agency as reimbursement under this subsection shall be equal to 100 percent of the amount expended by it in discharge of its insurance obligation incurred under its loan insurance program. A guaranty agency shall file a claim for reimbursement with respect to losses under this subsection within 30 days after the guaranty agency discharges its insurance obligation on the loan.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)

(i) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reimbursement payments by the Secretary under this subsection exceeds 5 percent of the loans which are insured by such guaranty agency under such program and which were in repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection for such excess shall be equal to 85 percent of the amount of such excess; and

(ii) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reimbursement payments exceeds 9 percent of such loans, the amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection for such excess shall be equal to 75 percent of the amount of such excess.

(C) For the purpose of this subsection, the amount of loans of a guaranty agency which are in repayment shall be the original principal amount of loans made by a lender which are insured by such a guaranty agency reduced by

(i) the amount the insurer has been required to pay to discharge its insurance obligations under this part;

(ii) the original principal amount of loans insured by it which have been fully repaid; and

(iii) the original principal amount insured on those loans for which payment of the first installment of principal has not become due pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(E) of this section or such first installment need not be paid pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section.

(D) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in the case of a loan made pursuant to a lender-of-last-resort program, the Secretary shall apply the provisions of

(i) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by substituting “100 percent” for “95 percent”;  1

(ii) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting “100 percent” for “85 percent”; and

(iii) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting “100 percent” for “75 percent”.

(E) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in the case of an outstanding loan transferred to a guaranty agency from another guaranty agency pursuant to a plan approved by the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the latter such guarantee agency, the Secretary shall apply the provision of

(i) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by substituting “100 percent” for “95 percent”;  1

(ii) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting “90 percent” for “85 percent”; and

(iii) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting “80 percent” for “75 percent”.

(F)

(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in the case of exempt claims, the Secretary shall apply the provisions of

(I) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by substituting “100 percent” for “95 percent”;  1

(II) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting “100 percent” for “85 percent”; and

(III) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting “100 percent” for “75 percent”.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph, the term “exempt claims” means claims with respect to loans for which it is determined that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent has borrowed), without the lender’s or the institution’s knowledge at the time the loan was made, provided false or erroneous information or took actions that caused the borrower or the student to be ineligible for all or a portion of the loan or for interest benefits thereon.

(G) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary shall exclude a loan made pursuant to a lender-of-last-resort program when making reimbursement payment calculations under subparagraphs (B) and (C).

(2) Contents of guaranty agreements

The guaranty agreement

(A) shall set forth such administrative and fiscal procedures as may be necessary to protect the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss thereunder, to ensure proper and efficient administration of the loan insurance program, and to assure that due diligence will be exercised in the collection of loans insured under the program, including (i) a requirement that each beneficiary of insurance on the loan submit proof that the institution was contacted and other reasonable attempts were made to locate the borrower (when the location of the borrower is unknown) and proof that contact was made with the borrower (when the location is known) and (ii) requirements establishing procedures to preclude consolidation lending from being an excessive proportion of guaranty agency recoveries on defaulted loans under this part;

(G) shall prohibit the Secretary from making any reimbursement under this subsection to a guaranty agency when a default claim is based on an inability to locate the borrower, unless the guaranty agency, at the time of filing for reimbursement, certifies to the Secretary that diligent attempts, including contact with the institution, have been made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary; and

(H) set forth assurances that

(i) upon the request of an eligible institution, the guaranty agency shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), furnish to the institution information with respect to students (including the names and addresses of such students) who received loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part for attendance at the eligible institution and for whom default aversion assistance activities have been requested under subsection ( l );

(i) upon request, a lender shall grant a borrower forbearance, renewable at 12-month intervals, on terms agreed to by the parties to the loan with the approval of the insurer and documented in accordance with paragraph (10), and otherwise consistent with the regulations of the Secretary, if the borrower

(I) is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program, the successful completion of which is required to begin professional practice or service, or is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training, provided that if the borrower qualifies for a deferment under section 1077(a)(2)(C)(vii) of this title or subsection (b)(1)(M)(vii) of this section as in effect prior to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or section 1077(a)(2)(C) of this title or subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section as amended by such amendments, the borrower has exhausted his or her eligibility for such deferment;

(II) has a debt burden under this subchapter that equals or exceeds 20 percent of income;

(III) is serving in a national service position for which the borrower receives a national service educational award under the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993; or

(IV) is eligible for interest payments to be made on such loan for service in the Armed Forces under section 2174 of title 10 , and, pursuant to that eligibility, the interest is being paid on such loan under subsection ( o );

(ii) the length of the forbearance granted by the lender

(I) under clause (i)(I) shall equal the length of time remaining in the borrower’s medical or dental internship or residency program, if the borrower is not eligible to receive a deferment described in such clause, or such length of time remaining in the program after the borrower has exhausted the borrower’s eligibility for such deferment;

(II) under clause (i)(II) or (IV) shall not exceed 3 years; or

(C) shall contain provisions that specify that

(i) the form of forbearance granted by the lender pursuant to this paragraph, other than subparagraph (A)(i)(IV), shall be temporary cessation of payments, unless the borrower selects forbearance in the form of an extension of time for making payments, or smaller payments than were previously scheduled;

(ii) the form of forbearance granted by the lender pursuant to subparagraph (A)(i)(IV) shall be the temporary cessation of all payments on the loan other than payments of interest on the loan that are made under subsection ( o );

(D) shall contain provisions that specify that

(i) forbearance for a period not to exceed 60 days may be granted if the lender reasonably determines that such a suspension of collection activity is warranted following a borrower’s request for deferment, forbearance, a change in repayment plan, or a request to consolidate loans, in order to collect or process appropriate supporting documentation related to the request, and

(ii) during such period interest shall accrue but not be capitalized. Guaranty agencies shall not be precluded from permitting the parties to such a loan from entering into a forbearance agreement solely because the loan is in default. The Secretary shall permit lenders to exercise administrative forbearances that do not require the agreement of the borrower, under conditions authorized by the Secretary. Such forbearances shall include (i) forbearances for borrowers who are delinquent at the time of the granting of an authorized period of deferment under subsection (b)(1)(M) or section 1077(a)(2)(C) of this title , and (ii) if the borrower is less than 60 days delinquent on such loans at the time of sale or transfer, forbearances for borrowers on loans which are sold or transferred.
