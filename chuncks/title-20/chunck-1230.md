#### § 1077a. Applicable interest rates
##### (i) Treatment of excess interest payments on new borrower accounts resulting from decline in Treasury bill rates

(1) Excess interest on 10 percent loans

If, with respect to a loan for which the applicable interest rate is 10 percent under subsection (d) of this section at the close of any calendar quarter, the sum of the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for that quarter and 3.25 percent is less than 10 percent, then an adjustment shall be made to a borrower’s account

(A) by calculating excess interest in the amount computed under paragraph (2) of this subsection; and

(B)

(i) during any period in which a student is eligible to have interest payments paid on his or her behalf by the Government pursuant to section 1078(a) of this title , by crediting the excess interest to the Government; or

(ii) during any other period, by crediting such excess interest to the reduction of principal to the extent provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

(2) Amount of adjustment for 10 percent loans

The amount of any adjustment of interest on a loan to be made under this subsection for any quarter shall be equal to

(A) 10 percent minus the sum of (i) the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such calendar quarter, and (ii) 3.25 percent; multiplied by

(B) the average daily principal balance of the loan (not including unearned interest added to principal) during such calendar quarter; divided by

(C) four.

(3) Excess interest on loans after 1992 amendments, to borrowers with outstanding balances

If, with respect to a loan made on or after July 23, 1992 , to a borrower, who on the date of entering into the note or other written evidence of the loan, has an outstanding balance of principal or interest on any other loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, the sum of the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for that quarter and 3.1 percent is less than the applicable interest rate, then an adjustment shall be made

(A) by calculating excess interest in the amount computed under paragraph (4) of this subsection; and

(B)

(i) during any period in which a student is eligible to have interest payments paid on his or her behalf by the Government pursuant to section 1078(a) of this title , by crediting the excess interest to the Government; or

(ii) during any other period, by crediting such excess interest to the reduction of principal to the extent provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection.

(4) Amount of adjustment

The amount of any adjustment of interest on a loan to be made under this subsection for any quarter shall be equal to

(A) the applicable interest rate minus the sum of (i) the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such calendar quarter, and (ii) 3.1 percent; multiplied by

(B) the average daily principal balance of the loan (not including unearned interest added to principal) during such calendar quarter; divided by

(C) four.

(5) Annual adjustment of interest and borrower eligibility for credit

Any adjustment amount computed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection for any quarter shall be credited, by the holder of the loan on the last day of the calendar year in which such quarter falls, to the loan account of the borrower so as to reduce the principal balance of such account. No such credit shall be made to the loan account of a borrower who on the last day of the calendar year is delinquent for more than 30 days in making a required payment on the loan, but the excess interest shall be calculated and credited to the Secretary. Any credit which is to be made to a borrower’s account pursuant to this subsection shall be made effective commencing no later than 30 days following the last day of the calendar year in which the quarter falls for which the credit is being made. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require refunding any repayment of a loan. At the option of the lender, the amount of such adjustment may be distributed to the borrower either by reduction in the amount of the periodic payment on loan, by reducing the number of payments that shall be made with respect to the loan, or by reducing the amount of the final payment of the loan. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the lender to make additional disclosures pursuant to section 1083(b) of this title .

(6) Publication of Treasury bill rate

For the purpose of enabling holders of loans to make the determinations and adjustments provided for in this subsection, the Secretary shall for each calendar quarter commencing with the quarter beginning on July 1, 1987 , publish a notice of the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned for such quarter. Such notice shall be published not later than 7 days after the end of the quarter to which the notice relates.

(7) Conversion to variable rate

(A) Subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), a lender or holder shall convert the interest rate on a loan that is made pursuant to this part and is subject to the provisions of this subsection to a variable rate. Such conversion shall occur not later than January 1, 1995 , and, commencing on the date of conversion, the applicable interest rate for each 12-month period beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 shall be determined by the Secretary on the June 1 preceding each such 12-month period and be equal to the sum of (i) the bond equivalent rate of the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned at the final auction prior to such June 1; and (ii) 3.25 percent in the case of loans described in paragraph (1), or 3.10 percent in the case of loans described in paragraph (3).

(B) In connection with the conversion specified in subparagraph (A) for any period prior to such conversion, and subject to paragraphs (C) and (D), a lender or holder shall convert the interest rate to a variable rate on a loan that is made pursuant to this part and is subject to the provisions of this subsection to a variable rate. The interest rates for such period shall be reset on a quarterly basis and the applicable interest rate for any quarter or portion thereof shall equal the sum of (i) the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-Treasury bills auctioned for the preceding 3-month period, and (ii) 3.25 percent in the case of loans described in paragraph (1) or 3.10 percent in the case of loans described in paragraph (3). The rebate of excess interest derived through this conversion shall be provided to the borrower as specified in paragraph (5) for loans described in paragraph (1) or to the Government and borrower as specified in paragraph (3).

(C) A lender or holder of a loan being converted pursuant to this paragraph shall complete such conversion on or before January 1, 1995 . The lender or holder shall notify the borrower that the loan shall be converted to a variable interest rate and provide a description of the rate to the borrower not later than 30 days prior to the conversion. The notice shall advise the borrower that such rate shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph and shall provide the borrower with a substantially equivalent benefit as the adjustment otherwise provided for under this subsection. Such notice may be incorporated into the disclosure required under section 1083(b) of this title if such disclosure has not been previously made.

(D) The interest rate on a loan converted to a variable rate pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum interest rate applicable to the loan prior to such conversion.

(E) Loans on which the interest rate is converted in accordance with subparagraph (A) or (B) shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subsection.
