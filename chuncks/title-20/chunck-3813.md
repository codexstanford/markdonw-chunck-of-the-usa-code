##### (d) Ratable reductions; reallocations

(1) In general

(A) Ratable reductions

If, after the Secretary reserves funds under section 6398(c) of this title , the amount appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year is insufficient to pay in full the amounts for which all States are eligible, the Secretary shall ratably reduce each such amount.

(B) Reallocation

If additional funds become available for making such payments for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate such funds to States in amounts that the Secretary determines will best carry out the purposes of this part.

(2) Special rule

(A) Further reductions

The Secretary shall further reduce the amount of any grant to a State under this part for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, based on available information on the numbers and needs of migratory children in the State and the program proposed by the State to address such needs, that such amount exceeds the amount required under section 6394 of this title .

(B) Reallocation

The Secretary shall reallocate such excess funds to other States whose grants under this part would otherwise be insufficient to provide an appropriate level of services to migratory children, in such amounts as the Secretary determines are appropriate.
