#### § 1087bb. Allocation of funds
##### (b) Allocation of excess based on share of excess eligible amounts

(1) From the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087aa(b)  1 of this title after making the allocations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which has an excess eligible amount an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as such excess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible amounts).

(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which

(A)

(i) that institution’s eligible amount (as determined under paragraph (3)), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible amounts of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087aa(b)  1 of this title for the fiscal year; exceeds

(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a), except that an eligible institution which has a cohort default rate in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f) may not receive an allocation under this paragraph.

(3) For any eligible institution, the eligible amount of that institution is equal to

(A) the amount of the institution’s self-help need, as determined under subsection (c); minus

(B) the institution’s anticipated collections; multiplied by

(C) the institution’s default penalty, as determined under subsection (e); except that, if the institution has a cohort default rate in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f), the eligible amount of that institution is zero.
