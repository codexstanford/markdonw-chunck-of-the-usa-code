In managing the National Student Loan Data System, the Secretary shall take actions necessary to maintain confidence in the data system, including, at a minimum

(2) prohibiting nongovernmental researchers and policy analysts from accessing personally identifiable information;

(3) creating a disclosure form for students and potential students that is distributed when such students complete the common financial reporting form under section 1090 of this title , and as a part of the exit counseling process under section 1092(b) of this title , that

(A) informs the students that any subchapter IV grant or loan the students receive will be included in the National Student Loan Data System, and instructs the students on how to access that information;

(B) describes the categories of individuals or entities that may access the data relating to such grant or loan through the data system, and for what purposes access is allowed;

(C) defines and explains the categories of information included in the data system;

(D) provides a summary of the provisions of section 1232g of this title (commonly known as the “Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974”) and other applicable Federal privacy statutes, and a statement of the students’ rights and responsibilities with respect to such statutes;

(E) explains the measures taken by the Department to safeguard the students’ data; and

(F) includes other information as determined appropriate by the Secretary;

(4) requiring guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and eligible institutions of higher education that enter into an agreement with a potential student, student, or parent of such student regarding a loan under part B, D, or E, to inform the student or parent that such loan shall be

(A) submitted to the data system; and

(B) accessible to guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and eligible institutions of higher education determined by the Secretary to be authorized users of the data system;

(5) regularly reviewing the data system to

(A) delete inactive users from the data system;

(B) ensure that the data in the data system are not being used for marketing purposes; and

(C) monitor the use of the data system by guaranty agencies and eligible lenders to determine whether an agency or lender is accessing the records of students in which the agency or lender has no existing financial interest;

(6) developing standardized protocols for limiting access to the data system that include

(A) collecting data on the usage of the data system to monitor whether access has been or is being used contrary to the purposes of the data system;

(B) defining the steps necessary for determining whether, and how, to deny or restrict access to the data system; and

(C) determining the steps necessary to reopen access to the data system following a denial or restriction of access; and

(7) preventing access to the data system and any other system used to administer a program under this subchapter by any person or entity for the purpose of assisting a student in managing loan repayment or applying for any repayment plan, consolidation loan, or other benefit authorized by this subchapter, unless such access meets the requirements described in subsection (e).
