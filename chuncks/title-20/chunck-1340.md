#### § 1082. Legal powers and responsibilities
##### (o) Consequences of guaranty agency insolvency

In the event that the Secretary has determined that a guaranty agency is unable to meet its insurance obligations under this part, the holder of loans insured by the guaranty agency may submit insurance claims directly to the Secretary and the Secretary shall pay to the holder the full insurance obligation of the guaranty agency, in accordance with insurance requirements no more stringent than those of the guaranty agency. Such arrangements shall continue until the Secretary is satisfied that the insurance obligations have been transferred to another guarantor who can meet those obligations or a successor will assume the outstanding insurance obligations.
