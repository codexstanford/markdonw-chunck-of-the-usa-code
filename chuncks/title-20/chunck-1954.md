#### § 1134. Award of Jacob K. Javits fellowships
##### (c) Interruptions of study

The institution of higher education may allow a fellowship recipient to interrupt periods of study for a period not to exceed 12 months for the purpose of work, travel, or independent study away from the campus, if such independent study is supportive of the fellowship recipient’s academic program and shall continue payments for those 12-month periods during which the student is pursuing travel or independent study supportive of the recipient’s academic program. In the case of other exceptional circumstances, such as active duty military service or personal or family member illness, the institution of higher education may also permit the fellowship recipient to interrupt periods of study for the duration of the tour of duty (in the case of military service) or for not more than 12 months (in any other case), but without payment of the stipend.
