#### § 1087e. Terms and conditions of loans
##### (e) Income contingent repayment

(1) Information and procedures

The Secretary may obtain such information as is reasonably necessary regarding the income of a borrower (and the borrower’s spouse, if applicable) of a loan made under this part that is, or may be, repaid pursuant to income contingent repayment, for the purpose of determining the annual repayment obligation of the borrower. Returns and return information (as defined in section 6103 of title 26 ) may be obtained under the preceding sentence only to the extent authorized by section 6103( l )(13) of title 26. The Secretary shall establish procedures for determining the borrower’s repayment obligation on that loan for such year, and such other procedures as are necessary to implement effectively income contingent repayment.

(2) Repayment based on adjusted gross income

A repayment schedule for a loan made under this part and repaid pursuant to income contingent repayment shall be based on the adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62 of title 26 ) of the borrower or, if the borrower is married and files a Federal income tax return jointly with the borrower’s spouse, on the adjusted gross income of the borrower and the borrower’s spouse.

(3) Additional documents

A borrower who chooses, or is required, to repay a loan made under this part pursuant to income contingent repayment, and for whom adjusted gross income is unavailable or does not reasonably reflect the borrower’s current income, shall provide to the Secretary other documentation of income satisfactory to the Secretary, which documentation the Secretary may use to determine an appropriate repayment schedule.

(4) Repayment schedules

Income contingent repayment schedules shall be established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary and shall require payments that vary in relation to the appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower (and the borrower’s spouse, if applicable) as determined by the Secretary.

(5) Calculation of balance due

The balance due on a loan made under this part that is repaid pursuant to income contingent repayment shall equal the unpaid principal amount of the loan, any accrued interest, and any fees, such as late charges, assessed on such loan. The Secretary may promulgate regulations limiting the amount of interest that may be capitalized on such loan, and the timing of any such capitalization.

(6) Notification to borrowers

The Secretary shall establish procedures under which a borrower of a loan made under this part who chooses or is required to repay such loan pursuant to income contingent repayment is notified of the terms and conditions of such plan, including notification of such borrower, that if a borrower considers that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower’s spouse, warrant an adjustment in the borrower’s loan repayment, the borrower may contact the Secretary, who shall determine whether such adjustment is appropriate, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary.

(7) Maximum repayment period

In calculating the extended period of time for which an income contingent repayment plan under this subsection may be in effect for a borrower, the Secretary shall include all time periods during which a borrower of loans under part B, part D, or part E

(A) is not in default on any loan that is included in the income contingent repayment plan; and

(B)

(i) is in deferment due to an economic hardship described in section 1085( o ) of this title;

(ii) makes monthly payments under paragraph (1) or (6) of section 1098e(b) of this title ;

(iii) makes monthly payments of not less than the monthly amount calculated under section 1078(b)(9)(A)(i) of this title or subsection (d)(1)(A), based on a 10-year repayment period, when the borrower first made the election described in section 1098e(b)(1) of this title ;

(iv) makes payments of not less than the payments required under a standard repayment plan under section 1078(b)(9)(A)(i) of this title or subsection (d)(1)(A) with a repayment period of 10 years; or

(v) makes payments under an income contingent repayment plan under subsection (d)(1)(D).

(8) Automatic recertification

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish and implement, with respect to any borrower described in subparagraph (B), procedures to

(i) use return information disclosed under section 6103( l )(13) of title 26, pursuant to approval provided under section 1098h of this title , to determine the repayment obligation of the borrower without further action by the borrower;

(ii) allow the borrower (or the spouse of the borrower), at any time, to opt out of disclosure under such section 6103( l )(13) and instead provide such information as the Secretary may require to determine the repayment obligation of the borrower (or withdraw from the repayment plan under this subsection); and

(iii) provide the borrower with an opportunity to update the return information so disclosed before the determination of the repayment obligation of the borrower.

(B) Applicability

Subparagraph (A) shall apply to each borrower of a loan made under this part who, on or after the date on which the Secretary establishes procedures under such subparagraph

(i) selects, or is required to repay such loan pursuant to, an income-contingent repayment plan; or

(ii) recertifies income or family size under such plan.
