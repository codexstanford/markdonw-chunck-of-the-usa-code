##### (a) Guidance

The Secretary shall continue to provide guidance that clarifies the role of institutions of higher education with respect to the disclosure of education records, including to a parent or legal guardian of a dependent student, in the event that such student demonstrates that the student poses a significant risk of harm to himself or herself or to others, including a significant risk of suicide, homicide, or assault. Such guidance shall further clarify that an institution of higher education that, in good faith, discloses education records or other information in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and section 1232g of this title (commonly known as the “Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974”) shall not be liable to any person for that disclosure.
