(2) Additional requirements to receive subsidy

(A) Each student qualifying for a portion of an interest payment under paragraph (1) shall

(i) have provided to the lender a statement from the eligible institution, at which the student has been accepted for enrollment, or at which the student is in attendance, which

(B) For the purpose of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), a student shall qualify for a portion of an interest payment under paragraph (1) if the eligible institution has determined and documented the student’s amount of need for a loan based on the student’s estimated cost of attendance, estimated financial assistance, and, for the purpose of an interest payment pursuant to this section, expected family contribution (as determined under part F), subject to the provisions of subparagraph (D).

(3) Amount of interest subsidy

(A)

(i) Subject to section 1087–1(c) of this title , the portion of the interest on a loan which a student is entitled to have paid, on behalf of and for the account of the student, to the holder of the loan pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be equal to the total amount of the interest on the unpaid principal amount of the loan

(I) which accrues prior to the date the student ceases to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload (as determined by the institution), or

(II) which accrues during a period in which principal need not be paid (whether or not such principal is in fact paid) by reason of a provision described in subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section or in section 1077(a)(2)(C) of this title .

(ii) Such portion of the interest on a loan shall not exceed, for any period, the amount of the interest on that loan which is payable by the student after taking into consideration the amount of any interest on that loan which the student is entitled to have paid on his or her behalf for that period under any State or private loan insurance program.

(iii) The holder of a loan with respect to which payments are required to be made under this section shall be deemed to have a contractual right, as against the United States, to receive from the Secretary the portion of interest which has been so determined without administrative delay after the receipt by the Secretary of an accurate and complete request for payment pursuant to paragraph (4).

(iv) The Secretary shall pay this portion of the interest to the holder of the loan on behalf of and for the account of the borrower at such times as may be specified in regulations in force when the applicable agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) was made, or, if the loan was made by a State or is insured under a program which is not covered by such an agreement, at such times as may be specified in regulations in force at the time the loan was paid to the student.

(v) A lender may not receive interest on a loan for any period that precedes the date that is

(I) in the case of a loan disbursed by check, 10 days before the first disbursement of the loan;

(II) in the case of a loan disbursed by electronic funds transfer, 3 days before the first disbursement of the loan; or

(III) in the case of a loan disbursed through an escrow agent, 3 days before the first disbursement of the loan.

(B) If

(i) a State student loan insurance program is covered by an agreement under subsection (b),

(ii) a statute of such State limits the interest rate on loans insured by such program to a rate which is less than the applicable interest rate under this part, and

(iii) the Secretary determines that subsection (d) does not make such statutory limitation inapplicable and that such statutory limitation threatens to impede the carrying out of the purpose of this part, then the Secretary may pay an administrative cost allowance to the holder of each loan which is insured under such program and which is made during the period beginning on the 60th day after October 16, 1968 , and ending 120 days after the adjournment of such State’s first regular legislative session which adjourns after January 1, 1969 . Such administrative cost allowance shall be paid over the term of the loan in an amount per year (determined by the Secretary) which shall not exceed 1 percent of the unpaid principal balance of the loan.

(4) Submission of statements by holders on amount of payment

Each holder of a loan with respect to which payments of interest are required to be made by the Secretary shall submit to the Secretary, at such time or times and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, statements containing such information as may be required by or pursuant to regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to determine the amount of the payment which he must make with respect to that loan.

(5) Duration of authority to make interest subsidized loans

The period referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall begin on November 8, 1965 , and end at the close of June 30, 2010 .

(6) Assessment of borrower’s financial condition not prohibited or required

Nothing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to prohibit or require, unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a lender to evaluate the total financial situation of a student making application for a loan under this part, or to counsel a student with respect to any such loan, or to make a decision based on such evaluation and counseling with respect to the dollar amount of any such loan.

(7) Loans that have not been consummated

Lenders may not charge interest or receive interest subsidies or special allowance payments for loans for which the disbursement checks have not been cashed or for which electronic funds transfers have not been completed.
