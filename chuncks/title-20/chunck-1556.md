##### (i) Adjustments to parents’ contribution for enrollment periods other than 9 months for purposes other than subpart 2 of part A of this subchapter

For periods of enrollment other than 9 months, the parents’ contribution from adjusted available income (as determined under subsection (b)) is determined as follows for purposes other than subpart 2 of part A of this subchapter:

(1) For periods of enrollment less than 9 months, the parents’ contribution from adjusted available income is divided by 9 and the result multiplied by the number of months enrolled.

(2) For periods of enrollment greater than 9 months

(A) the parents’ adjusted available income (determined in accordance with subsection (b)(1)) is increased by the difference between the income protection allowance (determined in accordance with subsection (c)(4)) for a family of four and a family of five, each with one child in college;

(B) the resulting revised parents’ adjusted available income is assessed according to subsection (e) and adjusted according to subsection (b)(3) to determine a revised parents’ contribution from adjusted available income;

(C) the original parents’ contribution from adjusted available income is subtracted from the revised parents’ contribution from adjusted available income, and the result is divided by 12 to determine the monthly adjustment amount; and

(D) the original parents’ contribution from adjusted available income is increased by the product of the monthly adjustment amount multiplied by the number of months greater than 9 for which the student will be enrolled.
