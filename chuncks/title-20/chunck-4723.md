(1) increase the number of students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds enrolled in graduate and undergraduate museum-related programs as well as other relevant programs offered through other education-focused entities, such as State and local governments, associations, and nonprofit organizations, in order to effectively prepare the students for, and retain the students in, careers in museum services;
