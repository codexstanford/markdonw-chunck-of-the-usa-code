(2) provide counseling, as appropriate, for eligible individuals participating in the programs to allow the eligible individuals to build a relationship with one or more guidance counselors during the period that the individuals are enrolled in the programs, including providing referrals and connections to community resources that help eligible individuals transition back into the community with the necessary life, social, academic, career, and technical skills after being in detention, or incarcerated, particularly resources related to health, housing, job training, and workplace readiness;

(3) provide training and education for eligible individuals participating in the programs, to allow such individuals to assist community officials and law enforcement agencies with the deterrence and prevention of gang and youth violence by participating in seminars, training, and workshops throughout the community; and

(4) provide each eligible individual participating in the programs with individual attention based on a curriculum that matches the interests and abilities of the individual to the resources of the program.
