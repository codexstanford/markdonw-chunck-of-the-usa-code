#### § 1078. Federal payments to reduce student interest costs
##### (i) Multiple disbursement of loans

(1) Escrow accounts administered by escrow agent

Any guaranty agency or eligible lender (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “escrow agent”) may enter into an agreement with any other eligible lender that is not an eligible institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “lender”) for the purpose of authorizing disbursements of the proceeds of a loan to a student. Such agreement shall provide that the lender will pay the proceeds of such loans into an escrow account to be administered by the escrow agent in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such agreement may allow the lender to make payments into the escrow account in amounts that do not exceed the sum of the amounts required for disbursement of initial or subsequent installments to borrowers and to make such payments not more than 10 days prior to the date of the disbursement of such installment to such borrowers. Such agreement shall require the lender to notify promptly the eligible institution when funds are escrowed under this subsection for a student at such institution.

(2) Authority of escrow agent

Each escrow agent entering into an agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection is authorized to

(A) make the disbursements in accordance with the note evidencing the loan;

(B) commingle the proceeds of all loans paid to the escrow agent pursuant to the escrow agreement entered into under such paragraph (1);

(C) invest the proceeds of such loans in obligations of the Federal Government or obligations which are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government;

(D) retain interest or other earnings on such investment; and

(E) return to the lender undisbursed funds when the student ceases to carry at an eligible institution at least one-half of the normal full-time academic workload as determined by the institution.
