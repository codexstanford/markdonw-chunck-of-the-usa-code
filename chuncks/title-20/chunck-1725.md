##### (b) Regulatory improvement and streamlining experiments

(1) In general

The Secretary shall continue the voluntary participation of any experimental sites in existence as of July 1, 2007 , unless the Secretary determines that such site’s participation has not been successful in carrying out the purposes of this section. Any experimental sites approved by the Secretary prior to such date that have not been successful in carrying out the purposes of this section shall be discontinued not later than June 30, 2010 .

(2) Report

The Secretary shall review and evaluate the experience of institutions participating as experimental sites and shall, on a biennial basis, submit a report based on the review and evaluation to the authorizing committees. Such report shall include

(A) a list of participating institutions and the specific statutory or regulatory waivers granted to each institution;

(B) the findings and conclusions reached regarding each of the experiments conducted; and

(C) recommendations for amendments to improve and streamline this chapter, based on the results of the experiment.

(3) Selection

(A) In general

The Secretary is authorized to periodically select a limited number of additional institutions for voluntary participation as experimental sites to provide recommendations to the Secretary on the impact and effectiveness of proposed regulations or new management initiatives.

(B) Waivers

The Secretary is authorized to waive, for any institution participating as an experimental site under subparagraph (A), any requirements in this subchapter, including requirements related to the award process and disbursement of student financial aid (such as innovative delivery systems for modular or compressed courses, or other innovative systems), verification of student financial aid application data, entrance and exit interviews, or other management procedures or processes as determined in the negotiated rulemaking process under section 1098a of this title , or regulations prescribed under this subchapter, that will bias the results of the experiment, except that the Secretary shall not waive any provisions with respect to award rules (other than an award rule related to an experiment in modular or compressed schedules), grant and loan maximum award amounts, and need analysis requirements unless the waiver of such provisions is authorized by another provision under this subchapter.

(4) Determination of success

For the purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a determination of success regarding an institution’s participation as an experimental site based on

(A) the ability of the experimental site to reduce administrative burdens to the institution, as documented in the Secretary’s biennial report under paragraph (2), without creating costs for the taxpayer; and

(B) whether the experimental site has improved the delivery of services to, or otherwise benefitted, students.
