##### (h) Net price calculator

(1) Development of net price calculator

Not later than one year after August 14, 2008 , the Secretary shall, in consultation with institutions of higher education and other appropriate experts, develop a net price calculator to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student’s individual net price at a particular institution.

(2) Calculation of individual net price

For purposes of this subsection, an individual net price of an institution of higher education shall be calculated in the same manner as the net price of such institution is calculated under subsection (a)(3), except that the cost of attendance and the amount of need-based and merit-based aid available shall be calculated for the individual student as much as practicable.

(3) Use of net price calculator by institutions

Not later than two years after the date on which the Secretary makes the calculator developed under paragraph (1) available to institutions of higher education, each institution of higher education that receives Federal funds under subchapter IV shall make publicly available on the institution’s website a net price calculator to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate a student’s individual net price at such institution of higher education. Such calculator may be a net price calculator developed

(A) by the Department pursuant to paragraph (1); or

(B) by the institution of higher education, if the institution’s calculator includes, at a minimum, the same data elements included in the calculator developed under paragraph (1).

(4) Disclaimer

(i) does not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance;

(iii) may change;
