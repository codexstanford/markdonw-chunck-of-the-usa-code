##### (b) Matching requirement

(1) In general

The Secretary shall not approve an application submitted under subsection (a) unless such application

(A) provides that the eligible entity will provide, from State, local, institutional, or private funds, not less than 50 percent of the cost of the program, which matching funds may be provided in cash or in kind and may be accrued over the full duration of the grant award period, except that the eligible entity shall make substantial progress towards meeting the matching requirement in each year of the grant award period;

(B) specifies the methods by which matching funds will be paid; and

(C) includes provisions designed to ensure that funds provided under this division shall supplement and not supplant funds expended for existing programs.

(2) Special rule

Notwithstanding the matching requirement described in paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may by regulation modify the percentage requirement described in paragraph (1)(A) for eligible entities described in section 1070a–21(c)(2) of this title . The Secretary may approve an eligible entity’s request for a reduced match percentage

(A) at the time of application

(i) if the eligible entity demonstrates significant economic hardship that precludes the eligible entity from meeting the matching requirement; or

(ii) if the eligible entity is described in section 1070a–21(c)(2) of this title and requests that contributions to the eligible entity’s scholarship fund established under section 1070a–25 of this title be matched on a two to one basis; or

(B) in response to a petition by an eligible entity subsequent to a grant award under this section if the eligible entity demonstrates that the matching funds described in its application are no longer available and the eligible entity has exhausted all revenues for replacing such matching funds.
