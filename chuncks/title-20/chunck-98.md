#### § 76r. Authorization of appropriations
##### (e) Limitation on use of funds

No funds appropriated pursuant to this section may be used for any direct expense incurred in the production of a performing arts attraction, for personnel who are involved in performing arts administration (including any supply or equipment used by the personnel), or for production, staging, public relations, marketing, fundraising, ticket sales, or education. Funds appropriated directly to the Board shall not affect nor diminish other Federal funds sought for any performing arts function and may be used to reimburse the Board for that portion of costs that are Federal costs reasonably allocated to building services and theater maintenance and repair.
