##### (d) Special disclosure rules on PLUS loans, and unsubsidized loans

Loans made under sections 1078–2 and 1078–8 of this title shall not be subject to the disclosure of projected monthly payment amounts required under subsection (b)(7) if the lender, in lieu of such disclosure, provides the borrower with sample projections of monthly repayment amounts, assuming different levels of borrowing and interest accruals resulting from capitalization of interest while the borrower, or the student on whose behalf the loan is made, is in school, in simple and understandable terms. Such sample projections shall disclose the cost to the borrower of

(1) capitalizing the interest; and

(2) paying the interest as the interest accrues.
