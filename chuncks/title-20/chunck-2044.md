##### (b) Duties of the Commission

(1) Study

(A) In general

The Commission shall conduct a comprehensive study to

(i) assess the barriers and systemic issues that may affect, and technical solutions available that may improve, the timely delivery and quality of accessible instructional materials for postsecondary students with print disabilities, as well as the effective use of such materials by faculty and staff; and

(ii) make recommendations related to the development of a comprehensive approach to improve the opportunities for postsecondary students with print disabilities to access instructional materials in specialized formats in a timeframe comparable to the availability of instructional materials for postsecondary nondisabled students.

(B) Existing information

To the extent practicable, in carrying out the study under this paragraph, the Commission shall identify and use existing research, recommendations, and information.

(C) Recommendations

(i) In general

The Commission shall develop recommendations

(I) to inform Federal regulations and legislation;

(II) to support the model demonstration programs authorized under section 1140m of this title ;

(III) to identify best practices in systems for collecting, maintaining, processing, and disseminating materials in specialized formats to students with print disabilities at costs comparable to instructional materials for postsecondary nondisabled students;

(IV) to improve the effective use of such materials by faculty and staff, while complying with applicable copyright law; and

(V) to modify the definitions of instructional materials, authorized entities, and eligible students, as such terms are used in applicable Federal law, for the purpose of improving services to students with disabilities.

(ii) Considerations

In developing the recommendations under clause (i), the Commission shall consider

(aa) within a timeframe comparable to the availability of instructional materials for nondisabled students; and

(bb) to the maximum extent practicable, at costs comparable to the costs of such materials for nondisabled students;

(II) the feasibility and technical parameters of establishing standardized electronic file formats, such as the National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard as defined in section 1474(e)(3) of this title , to be provided by publishers of instructional materials to producers of materials in specialized formats, institutions of higher education, and eligible students;

(III) the feasibility of establishing a national clearinghouse, repository, or file-sharing network for electronic files in specialized formats and files used in producing instructional materials in specialized formats, and a list of possible entities qualified to administer such clearinghouse, repository, or network;

(IV) the feasibility of establishing market-based solutions involving collaborations among publishers of instructional materials, producers of materials in specialized formats, and institutions of higher education;

(V) solutions utilizing universal design; and

(VI) solutions for low-incidence, high-cost requests for instructional materials in specialized formats.

(2) Report

Not later than one year after the Commission’s first meeting, the Commission shall submit a report to the Secretary and the authorizing committees detailing the findings and recommendations of the study conducted under paragraph (1).

(3) Dissemination of information

In carrying out the study under paragraph (1), the Commission shall disseminate information concerning the issues that are the subject of the study through

(A) the National Technical Assistance Center established under subpart 4; and

(B) other means, as determined by the Commission.
