(B) Exception

A school that serves an eligible school attendance area in which less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families, or a school for which less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from such families, may operate a schoolwide program under this section if the school receives a waiver from the State educational agency to do so, after taking into account how a schoolwide program will best serve the needs of the students in the school served under this part in improving academic achievement and other factors.

(2) Identification of students not required

(A) In general

No school participating in a schoolwide program shall be required to identify

(i) particular children under this part as eligible to participate in a schoolwide program; or

(ii) individual services as supplementary.

(B) Supplemental funds

In accordance with the method of determination described in section 6321(b)(2) of this title , a school participating in a schoolwide program shall use funds available to carry out this section only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds under this part, be made available from non-Federal sources for the school, including funds needed to provide services that are required by law for children with disabilities and English learners.

(3) Exemption from statutory and regulatory requirements

(A) Exemption

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may, through publication of a notice in the Federal Register, exempt schoolwide programs under this section from statutory or regulatory provisions of any other noncompetitive formula grant program administered by the Secretary (other than formula or discretionary grant programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), except as provided in section 613(a)(2)(D) of such Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(2)(D) )), or any discretionary grant program administered by the Secretary, to support schoolwide programs if the intent and purposes of such other programs are met.

(C) Records

A school that chooses to consolidate and use funds from different Federal programs under this section shall not be required to maintain separate fiscal accounting records, by program, that identify the specific activities supported by those particular funds as long as the school maintains records that demonstrate that the schoolwide program, considered as a whole, addresses the intent and purposes of each of the Federal programs that were consolidated to support the schoolwide program.
