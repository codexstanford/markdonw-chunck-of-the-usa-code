#### § 1082. Legal powers and responsibilities
##### (j) Authority of Secretary to take emergency actions against lenders

(1) Imposition of sanctions

If the Secretary

(A) receives information, determined by the Secretary to be reliable, that a lender is violating any provision of this subchapter, any regulation prescribed under this subchapter, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation;

(B) determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Federal funds; and

(C) determines that the likelihood of loss outweighs the importance of following the limitation, suspension, or termination procedures authorized in subsection (h); the Secretary shall, effective on the date on which a notice and statement of the basis of the action is mailed to the lender (by registered mail, return receipt requested), take emergency action to stop the issuance of guarantee commitments and the payment of interest benefits and special allowance to the lender.

(2) Length of emergency action

An emergency action under this subsection may not exceed 30 days unless a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding is initiated against the lender under subsection (h) before the expiration of that period.

(3) Opportunity to show cause

The Secretary shall provide the lender, if it so requests, an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action is unwarranted.
