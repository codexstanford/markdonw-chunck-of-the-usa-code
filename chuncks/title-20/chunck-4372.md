#### § 7702. Payments relating to Federal acquisition of real property
##### (h) Payments with respect to fiscal years in which insufficient funds are appropriated

For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title is insufficient to pay to each eligible local educational agency the full amount determined under subsection (b), the Secretary shall make payments to each local educational agency under this section as follows:

(1) Foundation payments for pre-2010 recipients

(A) In general

The Secretary shall first make a foundation payment to each local educational agency that is determined by the Secretary to be eligible to receive a payment under this section for the fiscal year involved and that filed a timely application, and met, or has been determined by statute to meet, the eligibility requirements of subsection (a) for fiscal year 2009.

(B) Amount

(i) In general

The amount of a payment under subparagraph (A) for a local educational agency shall be equal to the greater of 90 percent of the payment the local educational agency received from dollars appropriated for fiscal year 2009 or 90 percent of the average payment that the local educational agency received from dollars appropriated for fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and shall be calculated without regard to the maximum payment provisions in subsection (b)(1)(C).

(ii) Exception

In calculating such average payment for a local educational agency that did not receive a payment under subsection (b) for 1 or more of the fiscal years between fiscal year 2006 and 2009, inclusive, the lowest such payment made to the agency for fiscal year 2006, 2007, 2008, or 2009, shall be treated as the payment that the agency received under subsection (b) for each fiscal year for which the agency did not receive such a payment.

(C) Insufficient appropriations

If the amount appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title is insufficient to pay the full amount determined under this paragraph for all eligible local educational agencies for the fiscal year, then the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each local educational agency under this paragraph.

(2) Foundation payments for new applicants

(A) First year

From any amounts remaining after making payments under paragraph (1) and subsection (i)(1) for the fiscal year involved, the Secretary shall make a payment, in an amount determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), to each local educational agency that the Secretary determines eligible for a payment under this section for a fiscal year after fiscal year 2009 and that did not receive a payment under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year for which such agency was determined eligible for such payment.

(B) Second and succeeding years

For any succeeding fiscal year after the first fiscal year that a local educational agency receives a foundation payment under subparagraph (A), the amount of the local educational agency’s foundation payment under this paragraph for such succeeding fiscal year shall be equal to the local educational agency’s foundation payment under this paragraph for the first fiscal year.

(C) Amounts

The amount of a payment under subparagraph (A) for a local educational agency shall be determined as follows:

(i) Calculate the local educational agency’s maximum payment under subsection (b).

(ii) Calculate the percentage that the amount appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title for the most recent fiscal year for which the Secretary has completed making payments under this section is of the total maximum payments for such fiscal year for all local educational agencies eligible for a payment under subsection (b) and multiply the agency’s maximum payment by such percentage.

(iii) Multiply the amount determined under clause (ii) by 90 percent.

(D) Insufficient funds

If the amount appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title is insufficient to pay the full amount determined under this paragraph for all eligible local educational agencies for the fiscal year, then the Secretary shall ratably reduce the payment to each local educational agency under this paragraph.

(3) Remaining funds

From any funds remaining after making payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) for the fiscal year involved, the Secretary shall make a payment to each local educational agency that received a foundation payment under paragraph (1) or (2) or subsection (i)(1), for the fiscal year involved in an amount that bears the same relation to the remainder as a percentage share determined for the local educational agency (by dividing the maximum amount that the agency is eligible to receive under subsection (b) by the total of the maximum amounts for all such agencies) bears to the percentage share determined (in the same manner) for all local educational agencies eligible to receive a payment under this section for the fiscal year involved, except that, for the purpose of calculating a local educational agency’s maximum amount under subsection (b), data from the most current fiscal year shall be used.

(4) Data

For each local educational agency that received a payment under this section for fiscal year 2010 or any succeeding fiscal year, the Secretary shall not make a payment under paragraph (3) to a local educational agency that fails to submit, within 60 days of the date the Secretary notifies the agency that the information is needed, the data necessary to calculate the maximum amount of a payment under subsection (b) for that local educational agency.
