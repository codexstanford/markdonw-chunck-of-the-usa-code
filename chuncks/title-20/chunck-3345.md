#### § 4412. Board of Trustees
##### (i) Appointment exception for continuity

(1) In order to maintain the stability and continuity of the Board, the Board shall have the power to recommend the continuation of members on the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. When the Board makes such a recommendation, the Chairman of the Board shall transmit the recommendation to the President no later than 75 days prior to the expiration of the term of the member.

(2) If the President has not transmitted to the Senate a nomination to fill the position of a member covered by such a recommendation within 60 days from the date that the member’s term expires, the member shall be deemed to have been reappointed for another full term to the Board, with all the appropriate rights and responsibilities.

(3) This subsection shall not be construed to permit less than 7 members of the Board to be Indians. If an extension of a term under paragraph (2) would result in less than 7 members being Indians, the term of the member covered by paragraph (2) shall be deemed to expire 60 days after the date upon which it would have been deemed to expire without the operation of this subsection, except that the provisions of subsection (b)(4), relating to continuation of service pending replacement, shall continue to apply.
