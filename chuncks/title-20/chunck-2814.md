(3) State determined levels of performance

(A) State determined levels of performance for core indicators of performance

(i) In general

(I) Levels determined by the eligible agency

Each eligible agency, with input from eligible recipients, shall establish in the State plan submitted under section 2342 of this title , for each year covered by the State plan, State determined levels of performance for each of the core indicators described under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) for career and technical education activities authorized under this subchapter. The level of performance for a core indicator shall be the same for all CTE concentrators in the State.

(II) Technical assistance

The Secretary may assist an eligible agency in establishing the State determined levels of performance under this subparagraph only at the request of that eligible agency.

(III) Requirements

Such State determined levels of performance shall, at a minimum

(aa) be expressed in a percentage or numerical form, so as to be objective, quantifiable, and measurable;

(bb) require the State to continually make meaningful progress toward improving the performance of all career and technical education students, including the subgroups of students described in section 6311(h)(1)(C)(ii) of this title , and special populations, as described in section 2302(48) of this title ; and

(cc) have been subject to the public comment process described in subparagraph (B), and the eligible agency has provided a written response;

(dd) when being adjusted pursuant to clause (ii), take into account how the levels of performance involved compare with the State levels of performance established for other States, considering factors including the characteristics of actual (as opposed to anticipated) CTE concentrators when the CTE concentrators entered the program, and the services or instruction to be provided;

(ee) when being adjusted pursuant to clause (ii), be higher than the average actual performance of the 2 most recently completed program years, except in the case of unanticipated circumstances that require revisions in accordance with clause (iii); and
