##### (f) Stock of the Association

(1) Voting common stock

The Association shall have voting common stock having such par value as may be fixed by its Board of Directors from time to time. Each share of voting common stock shall be entitled to one vote with rights of cumulative voting at all elections of directors.

(2) Number of shares; transferability

The maximum number of shares of voting common stock that the Association may issue and have outstanding at any one time shall be fixed by the Board of Directors from time to time. Any voting common stock issued shall be fully transferable, except that, as to the Association, it shall be transferred only on the books of the Association.

(3) Dividends

To the extent that net income is earned and realized, subject to subsection (g)(2), dividends may be declared on voting common stock by the Board of Directors. Such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors shall be paid to the holders of outstanding shares of voting common stock, except that no such dividends shall be payable with respect to any share which has been called for redemption past the effective date of such call.

(4) Single class of voting common stock

As of the effective date of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, all of the previously authorized shares of voting common stock and nonvoting common stock of the Association shall be converted to shares of a single class of voting common stock on a share-for-share basis, without any further action on the part of the Association or any holder. Each outstanding certificate for voting or nonvoting common stock shall evidence ownership of the same number of shares of voting stock into which it is converted. All preexisting rights and obligations with respect to any class of common stock of the Association shall be deemed to be rights and obligations with respect to such converted shares.
