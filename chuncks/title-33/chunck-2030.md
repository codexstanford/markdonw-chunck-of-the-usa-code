#### § 2213. Flood control and other purposes
##### (b) Projects using nonstructural, natural, or nature-based features

(1) In general

The non-Federal share of the cost of a flood risk management or hurricane and storm damage risk reduction measure using a nonstructural feature, or a natural feature or nature-based feature (as those terms are defined in section 2289a(a) of this title ), shall be 35 percent of the cost of such measures. The non-Federal interests for any such measures shall be required to provide all lands, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations necessary for the project, but shall not be required to contribute any amount in cash during construction for a nonstructural feature if the costs of land, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations for such feature are estimated to exceed 35 percent.

(2) Non-Federal contribution in excess of 35 percent

At any time during construction of a project, if the Secretary determines that the costs of land, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations for the project, in combination with other costs contributed by the non-Federal interests, will exceed 35 percent, any additional costs for the project (not to exceed 65 percent of the total costs of the project) shall be a Federal responsibility and shall be contributed during construction as part of the Federal share.
