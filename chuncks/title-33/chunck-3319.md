#### § 4005. Great Lakes hypoxia and harmful algal blooms
##### (b) Plan

(1) In general

Not later than 2 years after June 30, 2014 , the Task Force shall develop and submit to the Congress a plan, based on the integrated assessment under subsection (a), for reducing, mitigating, and controlling hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes.

(2) Contents

The plan shall

(A) address the monitoring needs identified in the integrated assessment under subsection (a);

(B) develop a timeline and budgetary requirements for deployment of future assets;

(C) identify requirements for the development and verification of Great Lakes hypoxia and harmful algal bloom models, including

(i) all assumptions built into the models; and

(ii) data quality methods used to ensure the best available data are utilized; and

(D) describe efforts to improve the assessment of the impacts of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms by

(i) characterizing current and past biological conditions in ecosystems affected by hypoxia and harmful algal blooms; and

(ii) quantifying effects, including economic effects, at the population and community levels.

(3) Requirements

In developing the plan, the Task Force shall

(A) coordinate with State and local governments;

(B) consult with representatives from academic, agricultural, industry, and other stakeholder groups, including relevant Canadian agencies;

(C) ensure that the plan complements and does not duplicate activities conducted by other Federal or State agencies;

(D) identify critical research for reducing, mitigating, and controlling hypoxia events and their effects;

(E) evaluate cost-effective, incentive-based partnership approaches;

(F) ensure that the plan is technically sound and cost effective;

(G) utilize existing research, assessments, reports, and program activities;

(H) publish a summary of the proposed plan in the Federal Register at least 180 days prior to submitting the completed plan to Congress; and

(I) after submitting the completed plan to Congress, provide biennial progress reports on the activities toward achieving the objectives of the plan.
