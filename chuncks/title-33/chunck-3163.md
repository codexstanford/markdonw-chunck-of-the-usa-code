### CHAPTER 49— INTEGRATED COASTAL AND OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM
#### § 3611. Assessing and modeling named storms over coastal States
##### (b) Named Storm Event Model and post-storm assessment

(1) Establishment of Named Storm Event Model

(A) In general

Not later than December 31, 2020 , the Administrator shall develop the Named Storm Event Model.

(B) Accuracy

The Named Storm Event Model shall be designed to generate post-storm assessments, as provided in paragraph (2), that have a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent for an indeterminate loss for which a post-storm assessment is utilized.

(C) Public review

The Administrator shall seek input and suggestions from the public before the Named Storm Event Model, or any modification to the Named Storm Event Model, takes effect.

(2) Post-storm assessment

(A) Identification of named storms threatening coastal States

After the establishment of the COASTAL Formula, the Administrator shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, identify named storms that may reasonably constitute a threat to any portion of a coastal State.

(B) Data collection

(i) In general

Upon identification of a named storm under subparagraph (A), and pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c), the Administrator may deploy sensors to enhance the collection of covered data in the areas in coastal States that the Administrator determines are at the highest risk of experiencing geophysical events that would cause indeterminate losses.

(ii) Rule of construction

If the Administrator takes action under clause (i), that action may not be construed as indicating that a post-storm assessment will be developed for any coastal State in which that action is taken.

(C) Identification of indeterminate losses in coastal States

Not later than 30 days after the first date on which sustained winds of not less than 39 miles per hour are measured in a coastal State during a named storm identified under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify the Administrator with respect to the existence of any indeterminate losses in that coastal State resulting from that named storm.

(D) Post-storm assessment required

Upon confirmation of indeterminate losses identified under subparagraph (C) with respect to a named storm, the Administrator shall develop a post-storm assessment for each coastal State that suffered such indeterminate losses as a result of the named storm using the Named Storm Event Model and covered data collected for such named storm pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c)(1).

(E) Submittal of post-storm assessment

Not later than 90 days after any indeterminate losses are identified under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall submit to the Secretary of Homeland Security the post-storm assessment developed under subparagraph (D) for any coastal State that suffered such indeterminate losses.

(F) Separate post-storm assessments for a single named storm

(i) In general

The Administrator may conduct a separate post-storm assessment for each coastal State in which indeterminate losses are identified under subparagraph (C).

(ii) Timeline

If the Administrator conducts a separate post-storm assessment under clause (i), the Administrator shall complete the assessment based on the dates of actions that the Administrator takes under subparagraph (D).

(3) Accuracy

The Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that each post-storm assessment developed under paragraph (2) has a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent.

(4) Certification

For each post-storm assessment carried out under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall

(A) certify the degree of accuracy for such assessment, including specific reference to any segments or geographic areas for which the assessment is less than 90 percent accurate; and

(B) report such certification to the Secretary of Homeland Security for the purposes of use with indeterminate loss claims under section 4057 of title 42 .

(5) Finality of determinations

A certification of the degree of accuracy of a post-storm assessment under this subsection by the Administrator shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.

(6) Availability

The Administrator shall make available to the public the Named Storm Event Model and any post-storm assessment developed under this subsection.
