### CHAPTER 41— NATIONAL COASTAL MONITORING
#### § 2803. Comprehensive Coastal Water Quality Monitoring Program
##### (c) Monitoring guidelines and protocols

(1) Guidelines

Not later than 18 months after October 29, 1992 , the Administrator and the Under Secretary shall jointly issue coastal water quality monitoring guidelines to assist in the development and implementation of coastal water quality monitoring programs. The guidelines shall

(A) provide an appropriate degree of uniformity among the coastal water quality monitoring methods and data while preserving the flexibility of monitoring programs to address specific needs;

(B) establish scientifically valid monitoring methods that will

(i) provide simplified methods to survey and assess the water quality and ecological health of coastal waters;

(ii) identify and quantify through more intensive efforts the severity of existing or anticipated problems in selected coastal waters;

(iii) identify and quantify sources of pollution that cause or contribute to those problems, including point and nonpoint sources; and

(iv) evaluate over time the effectiveness of efforts to reduce or eliminate pollution from those sources;

(C) provide for data compatibility to enable data to be efficiently stored and shared by various users; and

(D) identify appropriate physical, chemical, and biological indicators of the health and quality of coastal ecosystems.

(2) Technical protocols

Guidelines issued under paragraph (1) shall include protocols for

(A) designing statistically valid coastal water quality monitoring networks and monitoring surveys, including assessment of the accumulation of floatables. 2

(B) sampling and analysis, including appropriate physical and chemical parameters, living resource parameters, and sediment analysis techniques; and

(C) quality control, quality assessment, and data consistency and management.

(3) Periodic review

The Administrator and the Under Secretary shall periodically review the guidelines and protocols issued under this subsection to evaluate their effectiveness, the degree to which they continue to answer program objectives and provide an appropriate degree of uniformity while taking local conditions into account, and any need to modify or supplement them with new guidelines and protocols, as needed.

(4) Discharge permit data

The Administrator or a State permitting authority shall ensure that compliance monitoring conducted pursuant to section 402(a)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ( 33 U.S.C. 1342(a)(2) ) for permits for discharges to coastal waters is consistent with the guidelines issued under this subsection. Any modifications of discharge permits necessary to implement this subsection shall be deemed to be minor modifications of such permit. Nothing in this subsection requires dischargers to conduct monitoring other than compliance monitoring pursuant to permits under section 402(a)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ( 33 U.S.C. 1342(a)(2) ).
