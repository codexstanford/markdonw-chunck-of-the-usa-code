#### § 3408. National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council
##### (i) Plan

(1) In general

Not later than 1 year after December 23, 2022 , the Council shall develop or update and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a plan for an integrated cross-sectoral ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization initiative.

(2) Elements

The plan required by paragraph (1) shall

(A) discuss the utility and benefits of ocean exploration and characterization;

(B) identify and describe national ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization priorities;

(C) identify and describe Federal and federally funded ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization programs;

(D) facilitate and incorporate non-Federal input into national ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization priorities;

(E) ensure effective coordination of ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization activities among programs described in subparagraph (C);

(F) identify opportunities for combining overlapping or complementary needs, activities, and resources of Federal agencies and non-Federal organizations relating to ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization while not reducing benefits from existing mapping, explorations, and characterization activities;

(G) promote new and existing partnerships among Federal and State agencies, Indian Tribes, private industry, academia, and nongovernmental organizations to conduct or support ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization activities and technology development needs, including through coordination under section 4102 of this title and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program under section 8931 of title 10 ;

(H) develop a transparent and sustained mechanism for non-Federal partnerships and stakeholder engagement in strategic planning and mission execution to be implemented not later than December 31, 2023 , for coordinating such activities with

(i) institutions of higher education (as such term is defined in section 1001(a) of title 20 , the private sector, philanthropic organizations, and nonprofits; and

(ii) international partners for activities relating to maritime areas (including the sea floor) beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Government;

(I) establish standardized collection and data management protocols, including with respect to metadata, for ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization which

(i) are publicly accessible and locatable via appropriate Federal repositories;

(ii) can facilitate the integration of ocean data into products and use innovations from non-Federal partners; and

(iii) have appropriate safeguards on the public accessibility of data to protect national security;

(J) encourage the development, testing, demonstration, and adoption of innovative ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization technologies and applications;

(K) promote protocols for accepting data, equipment, approaches, or other resources that support national ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization priorities;

(L) identify best practices for the protection of marine life during mapping, exploration, and characterization activities;

(M) identify training, technology, and other resource requirements for enabling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other appropriate Federal agencies to support a coordinated national ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization effort;

(N) identify and facilitate a centralized mechanism or office for coordinating data collection, compilation, processing, archiving, and dissemination activities relating to ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization that meets Federal mandates for data accuracy and accessibility;

(O) designate repositories responsible for archiving and managing ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization data;

(P) set forth a timetable and estimated costs for implementation and completion of the plan;

(Q) to the extent practicable, align ocean exploration and characterization efforts with existing programs and identify key gaps; and

(R) identify criteria for determining the optimal frequency of observations; and

(S) provide recommendations, developed in coordination with the private sector, to improve incentives, access, and processes for the private sector to share ocean-related data with the public and Federal Government.
