#### § 3704. Strategic research plan
##### (c) Program elements

The plan shall include at a minimum the following program elements:

(1) Monitoring of ocean chemistry and biological impacts associated with ocean acidification at selected coastal and open-ocean monitoring stations, including satellite-based monitoring to characterize

(A) marine ecosystems;

(B) changes in marine productivity; and

(C) changes in ocean chemistry.

(2) Research to understand the species specific physiological responses of marine organisms to ocean acidification and coastal acidification, impacts on marine food webs of ocean acidification and coastal acidification, and to develop environmental and ecological indices that track marine ecosystem responses to ocean acidification and coastal acidification.

(3) Modeling to predict changes in the ocean carbon cycle as a function of carbon dioxide and atmosphere-induced changes in temperature, ocean circulation, biogeochemistry, ecosystem and terrestrial inputs, modeling to determine impacts on marine ecosystems, marine food webs, and individual marine organisms, and modeling that supports fisheries management.

(4) Technology development and standardization of carbonate chemistry measurements on moorings and autonomous floats.

(5) Assessment of socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification and coastal acidification and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to conserve marine organisms and marine ecosystems.

(6) Research to understand the combined impact of changes in ocean chemistry and other stressors, including sediment delivery, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms, on each other and on living marine resources, including aquaculture and coastal ecosystems.

(7) Applied research to identify adaptation strategies for species impacted by changes in ocean chemistry including vegetation-based systems, shell recycling, species and genetic diversity, applied technologies, aquaculture methodologies, and management recommendations.

(8) Research to understand related and cumulative stressors and other biogeochemical processes occurring in conjunction with ocean acidification and coastal acidification.
