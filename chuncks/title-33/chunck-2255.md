### CHAPTER 36— WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
#### § 2283. Fish and wildlife mitigation
##### (d) Mitigation plans as part of project proposals

(1) In general

After November 17, 1986 , the Secretary shall not submit any proposal for the authorization of any water resources project to Congress in any report, and shall not select a project alternative in any report, unless such report contains (A) a recommendation with a specific plan to mitigate for damages to ecological resources, including terrestrial and aquatic resources, and fish and wildlife losses created by such project, or (B) a determination by the Secretary that such project will have negligible adverse impact on ecological resources and fish and wildlife without the implementation of mitigation measures. Specific mitigation plans shall ensure that impacts to bottomland hardwood forests are mitigated in-kind, and other habitat types are mitigated to not less than in-kind conditions, to the extent possible. If the Secretary determines that mitigation to in-kind conditions is not possible, the Secretary shall identify in the report the basis for that determination and the mitigation measures that will be implemented to meet the requirements of this section and the goals of section 2317(a)(1) of this title . In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies.

(2) Selection and design of mitigation projects

The Secretary shall select and design mitigation projects using a watershed approach to reflect contemporary understanding of the science of mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of water resources projects.

(3) Mitigation requirements

(A) In general

To mitigate losses to flood damage reduction capabilities and fish and wildlife resulting from a water resources project, the Secretary shall ensure that the mitigation plan for each water resources project complies with, at a minimum, the mitigation standards and policies established pursuant to the regulatory programs administered by the Secretary.

(B) Inclusions

A specific mitigation plan for a water resources project under paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum

(i) a plan for monitoring the implementation and ecological success of each mitigation measure, including the cost and duration of any monitoring, and, to the extent practicable, a designation of the entities that will be responsible for the monitoring;

(ii) the criteria for ecological success by which the mitigation will be evaluated and determined to be successful based on replacement of lost functions and values of the habitat, including hydrologic and vegetative characteristics;

(iii) for projects where mitigation will be carried out by the Secretary

(I) a description of the land and interest in land to be acquired for the mitigation plan;

(II) the basis for a determination that the land and interests are available for acquisition; and

(III) a determination that the proposed interest sought does not exceed the minimum interest in land necessary to meet the mitigation requirements for the project;

(iv) for projects where mitigation will be carried out through a third party mitigation arrangement in accordance with subsection (i)

(I) a description of the third party mitigation instrument to be used; and

(II) the basis for a determination that the mitigation instrument can meet the mitigation requirements for the project;

(v) a description of

(I) the types and amount of restoration activities to be conducted;

(II) the physical action to be undertaken to achieve the mitigation objectives within the watershed in which such losses occur and, in any case in which the mitigation will occur outside the watershed, a detailed explanation for undertaking the mitigation outside the watershed; and

(III) the functions and values that will result from the mitigation plan; and

(vi) a contingency plan for taking corrective actions in cases in which monitoring demonstrates that mitigation measures are not achieving ecological success in accordance with criteria under clause (ii).

(C) Responsibility for monitoring

In any case in which it is not practicable to identify in a mitigation plan for a water resources project the entity responsible for monitoring at the time of a final report of the Chief of Engineers or other final decision document for the project, such entity shall be identified in the partnership agreement entered into with the non-Federal interest under section 1962d–5b of title 42 .

(4) Determination of success

(A) In general

A mitigation plan under this subsection shall be considered to be successful at the time at which the criteria under paragraph (3)(B)(ii) are achieved under the plan, as determined by monitoring under paragraph (3)(B)(i).

(B) Consultation

In determining whether a mitigation plan is successful under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consult annually with appropriate Federal agencies and each State in which the applicable project is located on at least the following:

(i) The ecological success of the mitigation as of the date on which the report is submitted.

(ii) The likelihood that the mitigation will achieve ecological success, as defined in the mitigation plan.

(iii) The projected timeline for achieving that success.

(iv) Any recommendations for improving the likelihood of success.

(5) Monitoring

Mitigation monitoring shall continue until it has been demonstrated that the mitigation has met the ecological success criteria.
