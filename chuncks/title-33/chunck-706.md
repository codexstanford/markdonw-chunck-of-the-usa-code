The United States may, within the discretion of the Chief of Engineers irrespective of other provisions of law, proceed to acquire flowage rights and flowage easements in the northward extension of the Eudora floodway, as authorized by existing law, provided that pending the completion of such northward extension all the Riverside fuseplug levee extending south from the vicinity of Yancopin to the vicinity of Vau Cluse, Arkansas, and so as to connect with the existing levee of 1928 grade and section, shall be reconstructed to the 1914 grade and 1928 section: Provided further , That if the back protection levee is constructed prior to the construction of Eudora floodway, it shall be connected with the main Mississippi River levee and subsequently connected with the Eudora floodway when constructed: Provided further , That the Chief of Engineers is authorized, in his discretion, to negotiate options, make agreements and offers with respect to lands, flowage rights, easements, and rights-of-way involved, as provided by law, at prices deemed reasonable by him.

The United States, irrespective of other provisions of law, may, within the discretion of the Chief of Engineers, acquire flowage easements over all lands not subject to frequent overflow in the Atchafalaya Basin below the latitude of Krotz Springs.

Said Morganza floodway shall not be operated until the Wax Lake outlet has been put into operative condition.

The fuseplug levees at the head of the Atchafalaya Basin on the east side of the Atchafalaya River shall be reconstructed to the 1928 grade and section.

The United States may, in the discretion of the Chief of Engineers, acquire all flowage rights, flowage easements, rights-of-way for levee foundations, and titles in fee simple as herein provided, either by voluntary acquisition or in accordance with the condemnation proceedings by the Secretary of the Army as provided for in section 702d of this title .
