(II) to ensure compliance with all applicable standards and protocols established by the Council; and

(III) to ensure that regional observations are integrated into the System on a sustained basis;

(vi) identify gaps in observation coverage or needs for capital improvements of both Federal assets and non-Federal assets;

(vii) subject to the availability of appropriations, establish through 1 or more Federal agencies participating in the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee, in consultation with the System advisory committee established under subsection (d), a competitive matching grant or other programs

(I) to promote intramural and extramural research and development of new, innovative, and emerging observation technologies including testing and field trials; and

(II) to facilitate the migration of new, innovative, and emerging scientific and technological advances from research and development to operational deployment;

(viii) periodically

(I) review the System Plan; and

(II) submit to the Council such recommendations as the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee may have for improvements to the System Plan;

(ix) ensure collaboration among Federal agencies participating in the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee; and

(x) perform such additional duties as the Council may delegate.

(3) Lead Federal agency

(A) In general

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall function as the lead Federal agency for the implementation and administration of the System.

(B) Consultation required

In carrying out this paragraph, the Administrator shall consult with the Council, the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee, other Federal agencies that maintain portions of the System, and the regional coastal observing systems.

(C) Requirements

In carrying out this paragraph, the Administrator shall

(i) establish and operate an Integrated Ocean Observing System Program Office within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that

(I) utilizes, to the extent necessary, personnel from Federal agencies participating in the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee; and

(II) oversees daily operations and coordination of the System;

(ii) implement policies, protocols, and standards approved by the Council and delegated by the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee;

(iii) promulgate program guidelines

(I) to certify and integrate regional associations into the System; and

(II) to provide regional coastal and ocean observation data that meet the needs of user groups from the respective regions;

(iv) have the authority to enter into and oversee contracts, leases, grants, or cooperative agreements with non-Federal assets, including regional coastal observing systems, to support the purposes of this chapter on such terms as the Administrator deems appropriate;

(v) implement and maintain a merit-based, competitive funding process to support non-Federal assets, including the development and maintenance of a national network of regional coastal observing systems, and develop and implement a process for the periodic review and evaluation of the regional associations;

(vi) provide opportunities for competitive contracts and grants for demonstration projects to design, develop, integrate, deploy, maintain, and support components of the System;

(vii) establish and maintain efficient and effective administrative procedures for the timely allocation of funds among contractors, grantees, and non-Federal assets, including regional coastal observing systems;

(viii) develop and implement a process for the periodic review and evaluation of the regional coastal observing systems;

(ix) formulate an annual process by which gaps in observation coverage or needs for capital improvements of Federal assets and non-Federal assets of the System are

(I) identified by the regional associations described in the System Plan, the Administrator, or other members of the System; and

(II) submitted to the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee;

(x) develop and be responsible for a data management and communication system, in accordance with standards and protocols established by the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee, by which all data collected by the System regarding ocean and coastal waters of the United States including the Great Lakes, are processed, stored, integrated, and made available to all end-user communities;

(xi) not less frequently than once each year, submit to the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee a report on the accomplishments, operational needs, and performance of the System to contribute to the annual and long-term plans prepared pursuant to paragraph (2)(B)(i);
