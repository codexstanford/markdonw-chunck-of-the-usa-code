#### § 1301. Sewer overflow and stormwater reuse municipal grants
##### (c) Financially distressed community

(1) Definition

In subsection (b), the term “financially distressed community” means a community that meets affordability criteria established by the State in which the community is located, if such criteria are developed after public review and comment.

(2) Consideration of impact on water and sewer rates

In determining if a community is a distressed community for the purposes of subsection (b), the State shall consider, among other factors, the extent to which the rate of growth of a community’s tax base has been historically slow such that implementing a plan described in subsection (b)(2) would result in a significant increase in any water or sewer rate charged by the community’s publicly owned wastewater treatment facility.

(3) Information to assist States

The Administrator may publish information to assist States in establishing affordability criteria under paragraph (1).
