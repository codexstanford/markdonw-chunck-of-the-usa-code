#### § 2343. Independent peer review
##### (a) Project studies subject to independent peer review

(1) In general

Project studies shall be subject to a peer review by an independent panel of experts as determined under this section.

(2) Scope

The peer review may include a review of the economic and environmental assumptions and projections, project evaluation data, economic analyses, environmental analyses, engineering analyses, formulation of alternative plans, methods for integrating risk and uncertainty, models used in evaluation of economic or environmental impacts of proposed projects, and any biological opinions of the project study.

(3) Project studies subject to peer review

(A) Mandatory

A project study shall be subject to peer review under paragraph (1) if

(i) the project has an estimated total cost of more than $200,000,000, including mitigation costs, and is not determined by the Chief of Engineers to be exempt from peer review under paragraph (6);

(ii) the Governor of an affected State requests a peer review by an independent panel of experts; or

(iii) the Chief of Engineers determines that the project study is controversial considering the factors set forth in paragraph (4).

(B) Discretionary

(i) Agency request

A project study shall be considered by the Chief of Engineers for peer review under this section if the head of a Federal or State agency charged with reviewing the project study determines that the project is likely to have a significant adverse impact on environmental, cultural, or other resources under the jurisdiction of the agency after implementation of proposed mitigation plans and requests a peer review by an independent panel of experts.

(ii) Deadline for decision

A decision of the Chief of Engineers under this subparagraph whether to conduct a peer review shall be made within 21 days of the date of receipt of the request by the head of the Federal or State agency under clause (i).

(iii) Reasons for not conducting peer review

If the Chief of Engineers decides not to conduct a peer review following a request under clause (i), the Chief shall make publicly available, including on the Internet, the reasons for not conducting the peer review.

(iv) Appeal to Chairman of Council on Environmental Quality

A decision by the Chief of Engineers not to conduct a peer review following a request under clause (i) shall be subject to appeal by a person referred to in clause (i) to the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality if such appeal is made within the 30-day period following the date of the decision being made available under clause (iii). A decision of the Chairman on an appeal under this clause shall be made within 30 days of the date of the appeal.

(4) Factors to consider

In determining whether a project study is controversial under paragraph (3)(A)(iii), the Chief of Engineers shall consider if

(A) there is a significant public dispute as to the size, nature, or effects of the project; or

(B) there is a significant public dispute as to the economic or environmental costs or benefits of the project.

(5) Project studies excluded from peer review

The Chief of Engineers may exclude a project study from peer review under paragraph (1)

(A) if the project study does not include an environmental impact statement and is a project study subject to peer review under paragraph (3)(A)(i) that the Chief of Engineers determines

(i) is not controversial;

(ii) has no more than negligible adverse impacts on scarce or unique cultural, historic, or tribal resources;

(iii) has no substantial adverse impacts on fish and wildlife species and their habitat prior to the implementation of mitigation measures; and

(iv) has, before implementation of mitigation measures, no more than a negligible adverse impact on a species listed as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) or the critical habitat of such species designated under such Act;

(B) if the project study

(i) involves only the rehabilitation or replacement of existing hydropower turbines, lock structures, or flood control gates within the same footprint and for the same purpose as an existing water resources project;

(ii) is for an activity for which there is ample experience within the Corps of Engineers and industry to treat the activity as being routine; and

(iii) has minimal life safety risk; or

(C) if the project study does not include an environmental impact statement and is a project study pursued under section 701s of this title , section 701g of this title , section 701r of this title , section 577(a) of this title , section 426g of this title , section 426i of this title , section 603a of this title , section 2309a of this title , or section 2330 of this title .

(6) Determination of total cost

For purposes of determining the estimated total cost of a project under paragraph (3)(A), the total cost shall be based upon the reasonable estimates of the Chief of Engineers at the completion of the reconnaissance study for the project. If the reasonable estimate of total costs is subsequently determined to be in excess of the amount in paragraph (3)(A), the Chief of Engineers shall make a determination whether a project study is required to be reviewed under this section.
