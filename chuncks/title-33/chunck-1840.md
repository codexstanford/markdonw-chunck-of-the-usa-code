(C) to any other person.

(3) In determining whether any one proposed deepwater port clearly best serves the national interest, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:

(A) the degree to which the proposed deepwater ports affect the environment, as determined under criteria established pursuant to section 1505 of this title ;

(B) any significant differences between anticipated completion dates for the proposed deepwater ports; and

(C) any differences in costs of construction and operation of the proposed deepwater ports, to the extent that such differential may significantly affect the ultimate cost of oil to the consumer.

(4) The Secretary shall approve or deny any application for a deepwater port for natural gas submitted pursuant to this chapter not later than 90 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license. Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection shall not apply to an application for a deepwater port for natural gas.
