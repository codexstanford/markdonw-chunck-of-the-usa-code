#### § 3706. NSF ocean acidification activities
##### (a) Research activities

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall continue to carry out research activities on ocean acidification and coastal acidification which shall support competitive, merit-based, peer-reviewed proposals for research, observation, and monitoring of ocean acidification and coastal acidification and their respective impacts, including

(1) impacts on marine organisms, including species cultured for aquaculture, and marine ecosystems;

(2) impacts on ocean, coastal, and estuarine biogeochemistry;

(3) the development of methodologies and technologies to evaluate ocean acidification and coastal acidification and their respective impacts; and

(4) impacts of multiple stressors on ecosystems exhibiting hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, or sediment delivery, combined with changes in ocean chemistry; and

(5) adaptation and mitigation strategies to address socioeconomic effects of ocean acidification and coastal acidification.
