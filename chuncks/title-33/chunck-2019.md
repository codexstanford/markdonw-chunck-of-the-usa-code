#### § 2211. Harbors
##### (f) Consideration of funding requirements and equitable apportionment

The Secretary shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that

(1) funding requirements for operation and maintenance dredging of commercial navigation harbors are considered before Federal funds are obligated for payment of the Federal share of costs associated with the construction of dredged material disposal facilities in accordance with subsections (a) and (b);

(2) funds expended for such construction are apportioned equitably in accordance with regional needs; and

(3) use of a dredged material disposal facility designed, constructed, managed, or operated by a private entity is not precluded if, consistent with economic and environmental considerations, the facility is the least-cost alternative.
