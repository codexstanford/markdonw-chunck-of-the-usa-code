### CHAPTER 26— WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 1342. National pollutant discharge elimination system
##### (s) Integrated plans

(1) Definition of integrated plan

In this subsection, the term “integrated plan” means a plan developed in accordance with the Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Planning Approach Framework, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and dated June 5, 2012 .

(2) In general

The Administrator (or a State, in the case of a permit program approved by the Administrator) shall inform municipalities of the opportunity to develop an integrated plan that may be incorporated into a permit under this section.

(3) Scope

(A) Scope of permit incorporating integrated plan

A permit issued under this section that incorporates an integrated plan may integrate all requirements under this chapter addressed in the integrated plan, including requirements relating to

(i) a combined sewer overflow;

(ii) a capacity, management, operation, and maintenance program for sanitary sewer collection systems;

(iii) a municipal stormwater discharge;

(iv) a municipal wastewater discharge; and

(v) a water quality-based effluent limitation to implement an applicable wasteload allocation in a total maximum daily load.

(B) Inclusions in integrated plan

An integrated plan incorporated into a permit issued under this section may include the implementation of

(i) projects, including innovative projects, to reclaim, recycle, or reuse water; and

(ii) green infrastructure.

(4) Compliance schedules

(A) In general

A permit issued under this section that incorporates an integrated plan may include a schedule of compliance, under which actions taken to meet any applicable water quality-based effluent limitation may be implemented over more than 1 permit term if the schedule of compliance

(i) is authorized by State water quality standards; and

(ii) meets the requirements of section 122.47 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on January 14, 2019 ).

(B) Time for compliance

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the requirement of section 122.47 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, for compliance by an applicable statutory deadline under this chapter does not prohibit implementation of an applicable water quality-based effluent limitation over more than 1 permit term.

(C) Review

A schedule of compliance incorporated into a permit issued under this section may be reviewed at the time the permit is renewed to determine whether the schedule should be modified.

(5) Existing authorities retained

(A) Applicable standards

Nothing in this subsection modifies any obligation to comply with applicable technology and water quality-based effluent limitations under this chapter.

(B) Flexibility

Nothing in this subsection reduces or eliminates any flexibility available under this chapter, including the authority of a State to revise a water quality standard after a use attainability analysis under section 131.10(g) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation), subject to the approval of the Administrator under section 1313(c) of this title .

(6) Clarification of State authority

(A) In general

Nothing in section 1311(b)(1)(C) of this title precludes a State from authorizing in the water quality standards of the State the issuance of a schedule of compliance to meet water quality-based effluent limitations in permits that incorporate provisions of an integrated plan.

(B) Transition rule

In any case in which a discharge is subject to a judicial order or consent decree, as of January 14, 2019 , resolving an enforcement action under this chapter, any schedule of compliance issued pursuant to an authorization in a State water quality standard may not revise a schedule of compliance in that order or decree to be less stringent, unless the order or decree is modified by agreement of the parties and the court.
