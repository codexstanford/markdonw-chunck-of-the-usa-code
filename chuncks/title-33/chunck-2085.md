#### § 2232. Construction of water resources development projects by non-Federal interests
##### (d) Credit or reimbursement

(1) General rule

Subject to paragraph (3), a project or separable element of a project carried out by a non-Federal interest under this section shall be eligible for credit or reimbursement for the Federal share of work carried out on a project or separable element of a project if

(A) before initiation of construction of the project or separable element

(i) the Secretary approves the plans for construction of the project or separable element of the project by the non-Federal interest;

(ii) the Secretary determines, before approval of the plans, that the project or separable element of the project is feasible; and

(iii) the non-Federal interest enters into a written agreement with the Secretary under section 1962d–5b of title 42 , including an agreement to pay the non-Federal share, if any, of the cost of operation and maintenance of the project; and

(B) the Secretary determines that all Federal laws and regulations applicable to the construction of a water resources development project, and any conditions identified under subsection (b)(1)(B), were complied with by the non-Federal interest during construction of the project or separable element of the project.

(2) Application of credit

The Secretary may apply credit toward

(A) the non-Federal share of authorized separable elements of the same project; or

(B) subject to the requirements of this section and section 2223 of this title , at the request of the non-Federal interest, the non-Federal share of a different water resources development project.

(3) Requirements

The Secretary may only apply credit or provide reimbursement under paragraph (1) if

(A) Congress has authorized construction of the project or separable element of the project;

(B) the Secretary certifies that the project has been constructed in accordance with

(i) all applicable permits or approvals; and

(ii) this section; and

(C) in the case of reimbursement, appropriations are provided by Congress for such purpose.

(4) Monitoring

The Secretary shall regularly monitor and audit any water resources development project, or separable element of a water resources development project, constructed by a non-Federal interest under this section to ensure that

(A) the construction is carried out in compliance with the requirements of this section; and

(B) the costs of the construction are reasonable.

(5) Discrete segments

(A) In general

The Secretary may authorize credit or reimbursement under this subsection for carrying out a discrete segment of a federally authorized water resources development project, or separable element thereof, before final completion of the project or separable element if

(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the Secretary determines that the discrete segment satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (4) in the same manner as the project or separable element; and

(ii) notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the Secretary determines, before the approval of the plans under paragraph (1)(A)(i), that the discrete segment is technically feasible and environmentally acceptable.

(B) Determination

Credit or reimbursement may not be made available to a non-Federal interest pursuant to this paragraph until the Secretary determines that

(i) the construction of the discrete segment for which credit or reimbursement is requested is complete; and

(ii) the construction is consistent with the authorization of the applicable water resources development project, or separable element thereof, and the plans approved under paragraph (1)(A)(i).

(C) Written agreement

(i) In general

As part of the written agreement required under paragraph (1)(A)(iii), a non-Federal interest to be eligible for credit or reimbursement under this paragraph shall

(I) identify any discrete segment that the non-Federal interest may carry out; and

(II) agree to the completion of the water resources development project, or separable element thereof, with respect to which the discrete segment is a part and establish a timeframe for such completion.

(ii) Remittance

If a non-Federal interest fails to complete a water resources development project, or separable element thereof, that it agreed to complete under clause (i)(II), the non-Federal interest shall remit any reimbursements received under this paragraph for a discrete segment of such project or separable element.

(D) Discrete segment defined

In this paragraph, the term “discrete segment” means a physical portion of a water resources development project to be carried out, or separable element thereof

(i) described by a non-Federal interest in a written agreement required under paragraph (1)(A)(iii); and

(ii) that the non-Federal interest can operate and maintain, independently and without creating a hazard, in advance of final completion of the water resources development project, or separable element thereof.
