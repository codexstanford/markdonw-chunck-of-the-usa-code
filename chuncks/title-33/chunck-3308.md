### CHAPTER 53— HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM AND HYPOXIA RESEARCH AND CONTROL
#### § 4003. Comprehensive research plan and action strategy
##### (b) Regional focus

The regional and subregional parts of the Action Strategy shall identify

(1) regional priorities for ecological, economic, and social research on issues related to the impacts of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

(2) research, development, and demonstration activities needed to develop and advance technologies and techniques for minimizing the occurrence of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia and improving capabilities to detect, predict, monitor, control, mitigate, respond to, and remediate harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

(3) ways to reduce the duration and intensity of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, including deployment of response technologies in a timely manner;

(4) research and methods to address human health dimensions of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;

(5) mechanisms, including the potential costs and benefits of those mechanisms, to protect ecosystems that may be or have been affected by harmful algal bloom and hypoxia events;

(6) mechanisms by which data, information, and products may be transferred between the Program and the State, tribal, and local governments and research entities;

(7) communication and information dissemination methods that State, tribal, and local governments may undertake to educate and inform the public concerning harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and

(8) roles that Federal agencies may have to assist in the implementation of the Action Strategy, including efforts to support local and regional scientific assessments under section 4001(e) of this title .
