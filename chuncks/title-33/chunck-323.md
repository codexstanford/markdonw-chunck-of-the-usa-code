#### § 467f. National dam safety program
##### (e) Assistance for State dam safety programs

(1) In general

To encourage the establishment and maintenance of effective State programs intended to ensure dam safety, to protect human life and property, and to improve State dam safety programs, the Administrator shall provide assistance with amounts made available under section 467j  1 of this title to assist States in establishing, maintaining, and improving dam safety programs in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (2).

(2) Criteria and budgeting requirement

For a State to be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a State dam safety program must be working toward meeting the following criteria and budgeting requirement:

(A) Criteria

A State dam safety program must be authorized by State legislation to include, at a minimum

(i) the authority to review and approve plans and specifications to construct, enlarge, modify, remove, and abandon dams;

(ii) the authority to perform periodic inspections during dam construction to ensure compliance with approved plans and specifications;

(iii) a requirement that, on completion of dam construction, State approval must be given before operation of the dam;

(iv) the authority to require or perform periodic evaluations of all dams and reservoirs to determine the extent of the threat to human life and property in case of failure;

(v)

(I) the authority to require or perform the inspection, at least once every 5 years, of all dams and reservoirs that would pose a significant threat to human life and property in case of failure to determine the continued safety of the dams and reservoirs; and

(II) a procedure for more detailed and frequent safety inspections;

(vi) a requirement that all inspections be performed under the supervision of a State-registered professional engineer with related experience in dam design and construction;

(vii) the authority to issue notices, when appropriate, to require owners of dams to perform necessary maintenance or remedial work, install and monitor instrumentation, improve security, revise operating procedures, or take other actions, including breaching dams when necessary;

(viii) regulations for carrying out the legislation of the State described in this subparagraph;

(ix) provision for necessary funds

(I) to ensure timely repairs or other changes to, or removal of, a dam in order to protect human life and property; and

(II) if the owner of the dam does not take action described in subclause (I), to take appropriate action as expeditiously as practicable;

(x) a system of emergency procedures to be used if a dam fails or if the failure of a dam is imminent; and

(xi) an identification of

(I) each dam the failure of which could be reasonably expected to endanger human life;

(II) the maximum area that could be flooded if the dam failed; and

(III) necessary public facilities that would be affected by the flooding.

(B) Budgeting requirement

For a State to be eligible for assistance under this subsection, State appropriations must be budgeted to carry out the legislation of the State under subparagraph (A).

(3) Work plans

The Administrator shall enter into a  2 agreement with each State receiving assistance under paragraph (2) to develop a work plan necessary for the State dam safety program to reach a level of program performance specified in the agreement.

(4) Maintenance of effort

Assistance may not be provided to a State under this subsection for a fiscal year unless the State enters into such agreement with the Administrator as the Administrator requires to ensure that the State will maintain the aggregate expenditures of the State from all other sources for programs to ensure dam safety for the protection of human life and property at or above a level equal to the average annual level of such expenditures for the 2 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year.

(5) Approval of programs

(A) Submission

For a State to be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a plan for a State dam safety program shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval.

(B) Approval

A State dam safety program shall be deemed to be approved 120 days after the date of receipt by the Administrator unless the Administrator determines within the 120-day period that the State dam safety program fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3).

(C) Notification of disapproval

If the Administrator determines that a State dam safety program does not meet the requirements for approval, the Administrator shall immediately notify the State in writing and provide the reasons for the determination and the changes that are necessary for the plan to be approved.

(6) Review of State dam safety programs

Using the expertise of the Board, the Administrator shall periodically review State dam safety programs. If the Board finds that a State dam safety program has proven inadequate to reasonably protect human life and property and the Administrator concurs, the Administrator shall revoke approval of the State dam safety program, and withhold assistance under this subsection, until the State dam safety program again meets the requirements for approval.
