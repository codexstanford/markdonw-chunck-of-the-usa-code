(1) In general

(A) Economically disadvantaged communities

(B) Other communities

In preparing a feasibility report under subsection (a) for a study that will benefit a community other than a community described in subparagraph (A), upon request by the non-Federal interest for the study, the Secretary may, with respect to not more than 20 studies in each fiscal year, first determine the Federal interest in carrying out the study and the projects that may be proposed in the study.

(2) Cost share

The costs of a determination under paragraph (1)

(A) shall be at Federal expense; and

(B) shall not exceed $200,000.

(3) Deadline

A determination under paragraph (1) shall be completed by not later than 120 days after the date on which funds are made available to the Secretary to carry out the determination.

(4) Treatment

(A) Timing

The period during which a determination is being completed under paragraph (1) for a study shall not be included for purposes of the deadline to complete a final feasibility report under section 2282c(a)(1) of this title .

(B) Cost

The cost of a determination under paragraph (1) shall not be included for purposes of the maximum Federal cost under section 2282c(a)(2) of this title .

(5) Report to non-Federal interest

If, based on a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that a study or project is not in the Federal interest because the project will not result, or is unlikely to result, in a recommended plan that will produce national economic development benefits greater than cost, but may result in a technically sound and environmentally acceptable plan that is otherwise consistent with section 2281 of this title , the Secretary shall issue a report to the non-Federal interest with recommendations on how the non-Federal interest might modify the proposal such that the project could be in the Federal interest and feasible.
