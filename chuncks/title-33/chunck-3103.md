(2) give priority attention to deep ocean regions of the exclusive economic zone, with a focus on deep water marine systems that hold potential for important scientific discoveries, such as hydrothermal vent communities and seamounts;

(3) conduct scientific expeditions to locate, define, and document historic shipwrecks, submerged sites, and other ocean exploration activities that combine archaeology and oceanographic sciences;

(4) develop and implement a transparent, competitive process for merit-based peer-review and approval of proposals for activities to be conducted under this program, taking into consideration advice of the Board established under section 3405 of this title ;

(5) support technological innovation of the United States marine science community by promoting the development and use of new and emerging technologies for research, communication, navigation, and data collection, such as sensors and autonomous vehicles;

(6) establish an ocean exploration forum, in consultation with the National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council established under section 5405  1 of the James M.
