##### (a) In general

(1) Sediment use

(A) Sediment from Federal water resources projects

For sediment obtained through or used in the construction, operation, or maintenance of an authorized Federal water resources project, including a project authorized for flood control, the Secretary shall develop, at Federal expense, regional sediment management plans and carry out projects at locations identified in plans developed under this section, or identified jointly by the non-Federal interest and the Secretary, for use in the construction, repair, modification, or rehabilitation of projects associated with Federal water resources projects for purposes listed in paragraph (3).

(B) Sediment from other Federal sources and non-Federal sources

For purposes of projects carried out under this section, the Secretary may include sediment from other Federal sources and non-Federal sources, subject to the requirement that any sediment obtained from a non-Federal source shall not be obtained at Federal expense.

(2) Cooperation

The Secretary shall develop plans under this subsection in cooperation with the appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local agencies.

(3) Purposes for sediment use in projects

The purposes of using sediment for the construction, repair, modification, or rehabilitation of Federal water resources projects are

(A) to reduce storm damage to property;

(B) to protect, restore, and create aquatic and ecologically related habitats, including wetlands; and

(C) to transport and place suitable sediment for the purposes of improving environmental conditions in marsh and littoral systems, stabilizing stream channels, enhancing shorelines, and supporting State and local risk management adaptation strategies.

(4) Reducing costs

To reduce or avoid Federal costs, the Secretary shall consider the beneficial use of dredged material in a manner that contributes to the maintenance of sediment resources in the nearby coastal system.
