#### § 2314a. Technical assistance program
##### (a) In general

The Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance, on a nonexclusive basis, to any United States firm which is competing for, or has been awarded, a contract for the planning, design, or construction of a project outside the United States, if the United States firm provides, in advance of fiscal obligation by the United States, funds to cover all costs of such assistance. In determining whether to provide such assistance, the Secretary shall consider the effects on the Department of the Army civil works mission, personnel, and facilities. Prior to the Secretary providing such assistance, a United States firm must

(1) certify to the Secretary that such assistance is not otherwise reasonably and expeditiously available; and

(2) agree to hold and save the United States free from damages due to the planning, design, construction, operation, or maintenance of the project.
