### CHAPTER 45— TSUNAMI WARNING AND EDUCATION
#### § 3204. National tsunami hazard mitigation program
##### (c) Program components

The Program conducted under subsection (a) shall include the following:

(1) Technical and financial assistance to coastal States, territories, tribes, and local governments to develop and implement activities under this section.

(2) Integration of tsunami preparedness and mitigation programs into ongoing State-based hazard warning, resilience planning, and risk management activities, including predisaster planning, emergency response, evacuation planning, disaster recovery, hazard mitigation, and community development and redevelopment planning programs in affected areas.

(3) Coordination with other Federal preparedness and mitigation programs to leverage Federal investment, avoid duplication, and maximize effort.

(4) Activities to promote the adoption of tsunami resilience, preparedness, warning, and mitigation measures by Federal, State, territorial, tribal, and local governments and nongovernmental entities, including educational and risk communication programs to discourage development in high-risk areas.

(5) Activities to support the development of regional tsunami hazard and risk assessments. Such regional risk assessments may include the following:

(A) The sources, sizes, and other relevant historical data of tsunami in the region, including paleotsunami data.

(B) Inundation models and maps of critical infrastructure and socioeconomic vulnerability in areas subject to tsunami inundation.

(C) Maps of evacuation areas and evacuation routes, including, when appropriate, traffic studies that evaluate the viability of evacuation routes.

(D) Evaluations of the size of populations that will require evacuation, including populations with special evacuation needs.

(E) Evaluations and technical assistance for vertical evacuation structure planning for communities where models indicate limited or no ability for timely evacuation, especially in areas at risk of near shore generated tsunami.

(F) Evaluation of at-risk ports and harbors.

(G) Evaluation of the effect of tsunami currents on the foundations of closely-spaced, coastal high-rise structures.

(6) Activities to promote preparedness in at-risk ports and harbors, including the following:

(A) Evaluation and recommendation of procedures for ports and harbors in the event of a distant or near-field tsunami.

(B) A review of readiness, response, and communication strategies to ensure coordination and data sharing with the Coast Guard.

(7) Activities to support the development of community-based outreach and education programs to ensure community readiness and resilience, including the following:

(A) The development, implementation, and assessment of technical training and public education programs, including education programs that address unique characteristics of distant and near-field tsunami.

(B) The development of decision support tools.

(C) The incorporation of social science research into community readiness and resilience efforts.

(D) The development of evidence-based education guidelines.

(8) Dissemination of guidelines and standards for community planning, education, and training products, programs, and tools, including

(A) standards for

(i) mapping products;

(ii) inundation models; and

(iii) effective emergency exercises; and

(B) recommended guidance for at-risk port and harbor tsunami warning, evacuation, and response procedures in coordination with the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
