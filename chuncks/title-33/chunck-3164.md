##### (c) Establishment of a protocol for post-storm assessment

(1) In general

Not later than December 31, 2020 , the Administrator shall establish a protocol, based on the plan submitted under subsection (d)(3), to collect and assemble all covered data required by the Administrator to produce post-storm assessments required by subsection (b), including assembling data collected by participants and stored in the database established under subsection (f) and from such other sources as the Administrator considers appropriate.

To the extent practicable, consideration received under subparagraph (B) shall be used for the maintenance of sensors used to collect covered data.

(5) Coordinated deployments and data collection practices

The Administrator shall, in consultation with the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology, coordinate the deployment of sensors as part of the protocol established under paragraph (1) and related data collection carried out by Federal, State, academic, and private entities who choose to cooperate with the Administrator in carrying out this subsection.

(6) Priority acquisition and deployment

The Administrator shall give priority in the acquisition for and deployment of sensors under the protocol required by paragraph (1) to areas of coastal States that have the highest risk of being harmed by named storms.
