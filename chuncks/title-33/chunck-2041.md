(1) In general

Any cost-sharing agreement under this section for a feasibility study, or for construction of an environmental protection and restoration project, a flood control project, a project for navigation, storm damage protection, shoreline erosion, hurricane protection, or recreation, or an agricultural water supply project, shall be subject to the ability of the non-Federal interest to pay.

(2) Criteria and procedures

The ability of a non-Federal interest to pay shall be determined by the Secretary in accordance with criteria and procedures in effect under paragraph (3) on the day before December 11, 2000 ; except that such criteria and procedures shall be revised, and new criteria and procedures shall be developed, not later than December 31, 2007 , to reflect the requirements of such paragraph (3).

(3) Revision of criteria and procedures

In revising criteria and procedures pursuant to paragraph (2), the Secretary

(A) shall consider

(i) per capita income data for the county or counties in which the project is to be located; and

(ii) the per capita non-Federal cost of construction of the project for the county or counties in which the project is to be located; and

(B) may consider additional criteria relating to the non-Federal interest’s financial ability to carry out its cost-sharing responsibilities, to the extent that the application of such criteria does not eliminate areas from eligibility for a reduction in the non-Federal share as determined under subparagraph (A).

(4) Non-Federal share

Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Secretary may reduce the requirement that a non-Federal interest make a cash contribution for any project that is determined to be eligible for a reduction in the non-Federal share under criteria and procedures in effect under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
