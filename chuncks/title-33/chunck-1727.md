(1) In general

The Administrator shall, in a manner consistent with the criteria established pursuant to subsection (a), designate sites or time periods for dumping. The Administrator shall designate sites or time periods for dumping that will mitigate adverse impact on the environment to the greatest extent practicable.

(2) Prohibitions regarding site or time period

In any case where the Administrator determines that, with respect to certain materials, it is necessary to prohibit dumping at a site or during a time period, the Administrator shall prohibit the dumping of such materials in such site or during such time period. This prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during such time period. This prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during the time period, including any dumping under section 1413(e) of this title .

(3) Dredged material disposal sites

In the case of dredged material disposal sites, the Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary, shall develop a site management plan for each site designated pursuant to this section. In developing such plans, the Administrator and the Secretary shall provide opportunity for public comment. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to

(A) a baseline assessment of conditions at the site;

(B) a program for monitoring the site;

(C) special management conditions or practices to be implemented at each site that are necessary for protection of the environment;

(D) consideration of the quantity of the material to be disposed of at the site, and the presence, nature, and bioavailability of the contaminants in the material;

(E) consideration of the anticipated use of the site over the long term, including the anticipated closure date for the site, if applicable, and any need for management of the site after the closure of the site; and

(F) a schedule for review and revision of the plan (which shall not be reviewed and revised less frequently than 10 years after adoption of the plan, and every 10 years thereafter).

(4) General site management plan requirement; prohibitions

After January 1, 1995 , no site shall receive a final designation unless a management plan has been developed pursuant to this section. Beginning on January 1, 1997 , no permit for dumping pursuant to this Act or authorization for dumping under section 1413(e) of this title shall be issued for a site (other than the site located off the coast of Newport Beach, California, which is known as “LA–3”) unless such site has received a final designation pursuant to this subsection or an alternative site has been selected pursuant to section 1413(b) of this title . Beginning January 1, 2011 , no permit for dumping pursuant to this Act or authorization for dumping under section 1413(e) of this title shall be issued for the site located off the coast of Newport Beach, California, which is known as “LA–3”, unless such site has received a final designation pursuant to this subsection or an alternative site has been selected pursuant to section 1413(b) of this title .

(5) Management plans for previously designated sites

The Administrator shall develop a site management plan for any site designated prior to January 1, 1995 , as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than January 1, 1997 , giving priority consideration to management plans for designated sites that are considered to have the greatest impact on the environment.
