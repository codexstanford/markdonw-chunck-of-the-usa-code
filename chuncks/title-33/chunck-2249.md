#### § 2282g. Scope of feasibility studies
##### (a) Flood risk management or hurricane and storm damage risk reduction

In carrying out a feasibility study for a project for flood risk management or hurricane and storm damage risk reduction, the Secretary, at the request of the non-Federal interest for the study, shall formulate alternatives to maximize the net benefits from the reduction of the comprehensive flood risk within the geographic scope of the study from the isolated and compound effects of

(1) a riverine discharge of any magnitude or frequency;

(2) inundation, wave attack, and erosion coinciding with a hurricane or coastal storm;

(3) flooding associated with tidally influenced portions of rivers, bays, and estuaries that are hydrologically connected to the coastal water body;

(4) a rainfall event of any magnitude or frequency;

(5) a tide of any magnitude or frequency;

(6) seasonal variation in water levels;

(7) groundwater emergence;

(8) sea level rise;

(9) subsidence; or

(10) any other driver of flood risk affecting the area within the geographic scope of the study.
