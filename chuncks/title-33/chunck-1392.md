#### § 1302f. Stormwater infrastructure technology
##### (c) Stormwater control infrastructure project grants

(1) Grant authority

Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Administrator shall provide grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities to carry out stormwater control infrastructure projects that incorporate new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control technologies in accordance with this subsection.

(2) Stormwater control infrastructure projects

(A) Planning and development grants

The Administrator may make planning and development grants under this subsection for the following projects:

(i) Planning and designing stormwater control infrastructure projects that incorporate new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control technologies, including engineering surveys, landscape plans, maps, long-term operations and maintenance plans, and implementation plans.

(ii) Identifying and developing standards necessary to accommodate stormwater control infrastructure projects, including those projects that incorporate new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control technologies.

(iii) Identifying and developing fee structures to provide financial support for design, installation, and operations and maintenance of stormwater control infrastructure, including new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control infrastructure technologies.

(iv) Developing approaches for community-based public-private partnerships for the financing and construction of stormwater control infrastructure technologies, including feasibility studies, stakeholder outreach, and needs assessments.

(v) Developing and delivering training and educational materials regarding new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control infrastructure technologies for distribution to

(I) individuals and entities with applicable technical knowledge; and

(II) the public.

(B) Implementation grants

The Administrator may make implementation grants under this subsection for the following projects:

(i) Installing new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control infrastructure technologies.

(ii) Protecting or restoring interconnected networks of natural areas that protect water quality.

(iii) Monitoring and evaluating the environmental, economic, or social benefits of stormwater control infrastructure technologies that incorporate new and emerging, but proven, stormwater control technology.

(iv) Implementing a best practices standard for stormwater control infrastructure programs.

(3) Application

Except as otherwise provided in this section, to be eligible to receive a grant under this subsection, an eligible entity shall prepare and submit to the Administrator an application at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Administrator may require, including, as applicable

(A) a description of the stormwater control infrastructure project that incorporates new and emerging, but proven, technologies;

(B) a plan for monitoring the impacts and pollutant load reductions associated with the stormwater control infrastructure project on the water quality and quantity;

(C) an evaluation of other environmental, economic, and social benefits of the stormwater control infrastructure project; and

(D) a plan for the long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater control infrastructure project and a tracking system, such as asset management practices.

(4) Priority

In making grants under this subsection, the Administrator shall give priority to applications submitted on behalf of

(A) a community that

(i) has municipal combined storm and sanitary sewers in the collection system of the community; or

(ii) is a small, rural, or disadvantaged community, as determined by the Administrator; or

(B) an eligible entity that will use not less than 15 percent of the grant to provide service to a small, rural, or disadvantaged community, as determined by the Administrator.

(5) Maximum amounts

(A) Planning and development grants

(i) Single grant

The amount of a single planning and development grant provided under this subsection shall be not more than $200,000.

(ii) Aggregate amount

The total amount of all planning and development grants provided under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be not more than ⅓ of the total amount made available to carry out this subsection.

(B) Implementation grants

(i) Single grant

The amount of a single implementation grant provided under this subsection shall be not more than $2,000,000.

(ii) Aggregate amount

The total amount of all implementation grants provided under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be not more than ⅔ of the total amount made available to carry out this subsection.

(6) Federal share

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Federal share of a grant provided under this subsection shall not exceed 80 percent of the total project cost.

(B) Credit for implementation grants

The Administrator shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of an implementation project carried out under this subsection the cost of planning, design, and construction work completed for the project using funds other than funds provided under this section.

(C) Exception

The Administrator may waive the Federal share limitation under subparagraph (A) for an eligible entity that has adequately demonstrated financial need.
