### CHAPTER 29— DEEPWATER PORTS
#### § 1503. License for ownership, construction, and operation of deepwater port
##### (e) Additional conditions; removal requirements, waiver; Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act applicable to utilization of components upon waiver of removal requirements

(1) In issuing a license for the ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port, the Secretary shall prescribe those conditions which the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the provisions and requirements of this chapter  2 or which are otherwise required by any Federal department or agency pursuant to the terms of this chapter. 2 To the extent practicable, conditions required to carry out the provisions and requirements of this chapter  2 shall be addressed in license conditions rather than by regulation and, to the extent practicable, the license shall allow a deepwater port’s operating procedures to be stated in an operations manual, approved by the Coast Guard, in accordance with section 1509(a) of this title , rather than in detailed and specific license conditions or regulations; except that basic standards and conditions shall be addressed in regulations. On petition of a licensee, the Secretary shall review any condition of a license issued under this chapter to determine if that condition is uniform, insofar as practicable, with the conditions of other licenses issued under this chapter, reasonable, and necessary to meet the objectives of this chapter. The Secretary shall amend or rescind any condition that is no longer necessary or otherwise required by any Federal department or agency under this chapter.

(2) No license shall be issued, transferred, or renewed under this chapter unless the licensee or transferee first agrees in writing that (A) there will be no substantial change from the plans, operational systems, and methods, procedures, and safeguards set forth in his license, as approved, without prior approval in writing from the Secretary; and (B) he will comply with any condition the Secretary may prescribe in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(3) The Secretary shall establish such bonding requirements or other assurances as he deems necessary to assure that, upon the revocation or termination of a license, the licensee will remove all components of the deepwater port. In the case of components lying in the subsoil below the seabed, the Secretary is authorized to waive the removal requirements if he finds that such removal is not otherwise necessary and that the remaining components do not constitute any threat to navigation or to the environment. At the request of the licensee, the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, is authorized to waive the removal requirement as to any components which he determines may be utilized in connection with the transportation of oil, natural gas, or other minerals, pursuant to a lease granted under the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.], after which waiver the utilization of such components shall be governed by the terms of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.
