Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Secretary may permit the full non-Federal contribution to be made without interest during construction of the project or separable element, or with interest at a rate determined pursuant to section 2216 of this title over a period of not more than thirty years from the date of completion of the project or separable element. Repayment contracts shall provide for recalculation of the interest rate at five-year intervals.

(2) Renegotiation of terms

(A) In general

At the request of a non-Federal interest, the Secretary and the non-Federal interest may renegotiate the terms and conditions of an eligible deferred payment, including

(i) permitting the non-Federal contribution to be made without interest, pursuant to paragraph (1);

(ii) recalculation of the interest rate;

(iii) full or partial forgiveness of interest accrued during the period of construction; and

(iv) a credit against construction interest for a non-Federal investment that benefits the completion or performance of the project or separable element.

(B) Eligible deferred payment

An eligible deferred payment agreement under subparagraph (A) is an agreement for which

(i) the non-Federal contribution was made with interest;

(ii) the period of project construction exceeds 10 years from the execution of a project partnership agreement or appropriation of funds; and

(iii) the construction interest exceeds $45,000,000.

(3) Credit for non-Federal contribution

(A) In general

The Secretary is authorized to credit any costs incurred by the non-Federal interest (including in-kind contributions) to remedy a design or construction deficiency of a covered project or separable element toward the non-Federal share of the cost of the covered project, if the Secretary determines the remedy to be integral to the completion or performance of the covered project.

(B) Credit of costs

If the non-Federal interest incurs costs or in-kind contributions for a project to remedy a design or construction deficiency of a project or separable element which has a 100 percent Federal cost share, and the Secretary determines the remedy to be integral to the completion or performance of the project, the Secretary is authorized to credit such costs to any interest accrued on a deferred non-Federal contribution.

(4) Treatment of pre-payment

(A) In general

Notwithstanding a deferred payment agreement with a non-Federal interest, the Secretary shall accept, without interest of any type, the repayment of a non-Federal contribution for any eligible deferred payment described in paragraph (2)(B) for which

(i) the non-Federal interest makes a payment of at least $200,000,000 for that eligible deferred payment agreement on or before September 30, 2021 ;

(ii) the non-Federal interest repays an amount equal to ⅔ of the remaining principal by September 30, 2023 ; and

(iii) the non-Federal interest repays the balance of remaining principal by June 1, 2032 .

(B) Repayment options

Repayment of a non-Federal contribution under subparagraph (A)(iii) may be satisfied through the provision by the non-Federal interest of fish and wildlife mitigation for one or more projects or separable elements, if the Secretary determines that

(i) the non-Federal interest has incurred costs for the provision of mitigation that

(I) equal or exceed the amount of the required repayment; and

(II) are in excess of any required non-Federal contribution for the project or separable element for which the mitigation is provided; and

(ii) the mitigation is integral to the project for which it is provided.
