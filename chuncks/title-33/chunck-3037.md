### CHAPTER 45— TSUNAMI WARNING AND EDUCATION
#### § 3203. Tsunami forecasting and warning program
##### (b) Components

The program under this section shall

(1) include the tsunami warning centers supported or maintained under subsection (d);

(2) to the degree practicable, maintain not less than 80 percent of the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis buoy array at operational capacity to optimize data reliability;

(3) utilize and maintain an array of robust tsunami detection technologies;

(4) maintain detection equipment in operational condition to fulfill the detection, forecasting, and warning requirements of this chapter;

(5) provide tsunami forecasting capability based on models and measurements, including tsunami inundation models and maps for use in increasing the preparedness of communities and safeguarding port and harbor operations, that incorporate inputs, including

(A) the United States and global ocean and coastal observing system;

(B) the global Earth observing system;

(C) the global seismic network;

(D) the Advanced National Seismic system;

(E) tsunami model validation using historical and paleotsunami data;

(F) digital elevation models and bathymetry; and

(G) newly developing tsunami detection methodologies using satellites and airborne remote sensing;

(6) maintain data quality and management systems to support the requirements of the program;

(7) include a cooperative effort among the Administration, the United States Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation under which the Director of the United States Geological Survey and the Director of the National Science Foundation shall

(A) provide rapid and reliable seismic information to the Administrator from international and domestic seismic networks; and

(B) support seismic stations installed before April 18, 2017 , to supplement coverage in areas of sparse instrumentation;

(8) provide a capability for the dissemination of warnings, including graphical warning products, to at-risk States, territories, and tsunami communities through rapid and reliable notification to government officials and the public, including utilization of and coordination with existing Federal warning systems, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio All Hazards Program and Wireless Emergency Alerts;

(9) provide and allow, as practicable, for integration of tsunami detection technologies with other environmental observing technologies and commercial and Federal undersea communications cables; and

(10) include any technology the Administrator considers appropriate to fulfill the objectives of the program under this section.
