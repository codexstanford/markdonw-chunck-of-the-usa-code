### CHAPTER 50— FEDERAL OCEAN ACIDIFICATION RESEARCH AND MONITORING
#### § 3704. Strategic research plan
##### (b) Contents of the plan

The plan shall

(1) provide for interdisciplinary research among the ocean sciences and social sciences, and coordinated research and activities to improve the understanding of ocean chemistry that will affect marine ecosystems;

(2) establish, for the 10-year period beginning in the year the plan is submitted, the goals and priorities for Federal research and monitoring which will

(A) advance understanding of ocean acidification and its physical, chemical, and biological impacts on marine organisms and marine ecosystems;

(B) assess the short-term and long-term socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification;

(C) provide information for the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to address

(i) socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification and coastal acidification;

(ii) conservation of marine organisms and ecosystems;

(iii) assessment of the effectiveness of such adaptation and mitigation strategies; and

(D) improve research on

(i) ocean acidification and coastal acidification;

(ii) the interactions between and effects of ocean and coastal acidification and multiple combined stressors including changes in water chemistry, changes in sediment delivery, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms, on ocean acidification and coastal acidification; and

(iii) the effect or effects of clauses (i) and (ii) on marine resources and ecosystems;

(3) describe specific activities, including

(A) efforts to determine user needs;

(B) research activities;

(C) monitoring activities;

(D) technology and methods development;

(E) data collection;

(F) data management;

(G) modeling activities;

(H) assessment of ocean acidification impacts;

(I) participation in international research efforts;

(J) assessment of adaptation and mitigation strategies; and

(K) education and outreach activities;

(4) identify relevant programs and activities of the Federal agencies that contribute to the interagency program directly and indirectly and ensure an appropriate balance of contribution in establishing the role of each Federal agency in implementing the plan;

(5) consider and utilize, as appropriate, the best available peer-reviewed scientific reports and studies conducted by Federal agencies, the National Research Council, or other entities;

(6) make recommendations for the coordination of the ocean acidification and coastal acidification research and monitoring activities within the United States with such activities of other nations and international organizations;

(7) outline budget requirements for Federal ocean acidification research and monitoring and assessment activities to be conducted by each agency under the plan;

(8) identify the monitoring systems and sampling programs currently employed in collecting data relevant to ocean acidification and coastal acidification and prioritize additional monitoring systems that may be needed to ensure adequate data collection and monitoring of ocean acidification and coastal acidification and their impacts;

(9) describe specific activities designed to facilitate outreach and data and information exchange with stakeholder communities;

(10) make recommendations for research to be conducted, including in the social sciences and economics, to address the key knowledge gaps identified in the Ocean Chemistry Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment conducted under section 3703(c)(4)  1 of this title;

(11) describe monitoring needs necessary to support potentially affected industry members, coastal stakeholders, fishery management councils and commissions, Tribal governments, non-Federal resource managers, and scientific experts on decision-making and adaptation related to ocean acidification and coastal acidification; and

(12) describe the extent to which the Subcommittee incorporated feedback from the Advisory Board established in section 3703(c) of this title .
