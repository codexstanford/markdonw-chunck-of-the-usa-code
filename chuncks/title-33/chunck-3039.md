### CHAPTER 45— TSUNAMI WARNING AND EDUCATION
#### § 3203. Tsunami forecasting and warning program
##### (d) Tsunami warning centers

(1) In general

The Administrator shall support or maintain centers to support the tsunami warning system required by subsection (c). The Centers  1 shall include

(A) the National Tsunami Warning Center, located in Alaska, which is primarily responsible for Alaska and the continental United States;

(B) the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, located in Hawaii, which is primarily responsible for Hawaii, the Caribbean, and other areas of the Pacific not covered by the National Center; and

(C) any additional forecast and warning centers determined by the National Weather Service to be necessary.

(2) Responsibilities

The responsibilities of the centers supported or maintained under paragraph (1) shall include the following:

(A) Continuously monitoring data from seismological, deep ocean, coastal sea level, and tidal monitoring stations and other data sources as may be developed and deployed.

(B) Evaluating earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions that have the potential to generate tsunami.

(C) Evaluating deep ocean buoy data and tidal monitoring stations for indications of tsunami resulting from earthquakes and other sources.

(D) To the extent practicable, utilizing a range of models, including ensemble models, to predict tsunami, including arrival times, flooding estimates, coastal and harbor currents, and duration.

(E) Using data from the Integrated Ocean Observing System of the Administration in coordination with regional associations to calculate new inundation estimates and periodically update existing inundation estimates.

(F) Disseminating forecasts and tsunami warning bulletins to Federal, State, tribal, and local government officials and the public.

(G) Coordinating with the tsunami hazard mitigation program conducted under section 3204 of this title to ensure ongoing sharing of information between forecasters and emergency management officials.

(H) In coordination with the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, evaluating and recommending procedures for ports and harbors at risk of tsunami inundation, including review of readiness, response, and communication strategies, and data sharing policies, to the maximum extent practicable.

(I) Making data gathered under this chapter and post-warning analyses conducted by the National Weather Service or other relevant Administration offices available to the public.

(J) Integrating and modernizing the program operated under this section with advances in tsunami science to improve performance without compromising service.

(3) Fail-safe warning capability

The tsunami warning centers supported or maintained under paragraph (1) shall maintain a fail-safe warning capability and perform back-up duties for each other.

(4) Coordination with National Weather Service

The Administrator shall coordinate with the forecast offices of the National Weather Service, the centers supported or maintained under paragraph (1), and such program offices of the Administration as the Administrator or the coordinating committee, as established in section 3204(d)  2 of this title, consider appropriate to ensure that regional and local forecast offices

(A) have the technical knowledge and capability to disseminate tsunami warnings for the communities they serve;

(B) leverage connections with local emergency management officials for optimally disseminating tsunami warnings and forecasts; and

(C) implement mass communication tools in effect on the day before April 18, 2017 , used by the National Weather Service on such date and newer mass communication technologies as they are developed as a part of the Weather-Ready Nation program of the Administration, or otherwise, for the purpose of timely and effective delivery of tsunami warnings.

(5) Uniform operating procedures

The Administrator shall

(A) develop uniform operational procedures for the centers supported or maintained under paragraph (1), including the use of software applications, checklists, decision support tools, and tsunami warning products that have been standardized across the program supported under this section;

(B) ensure that processes and products of the warning system operated under subsection (c)

(i) reflect industry best practices when practicable;

(ii) conform to the maximum extent practicable with internationally recognized standards for information technology; and

(iii) conform to the maximum extent practicable with other warning products and practices of the National Weather Service;

(C) ensure that future adjustments to operational protocols, processes, and warning products

(i) are made consistently across the warning system operated under subsection (c); and

(ii) are applied in a uniform manner across such warning system;

(D) establish a systematic method for information technology product development to improve long-term technology planning efforts; and

(E) disseminate guidelines and metrics for evaluating and improving tsunami forecast models.

(6) Available resources

The Administrator, through the National Weather Service, shall ensure that resources are available to fulfill the obligations of this chapter. This includes ensuring supercomputing resources are available to run, as rapidly as possible, such computer models as are needed for purposes of the tsunami warning system operated under subsection (c).
