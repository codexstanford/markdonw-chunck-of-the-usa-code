#### § 3307. Assessment of Corps of Engineers levees
##### (c) Assessments

(1) Considerations

In conducting an assessment under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider and identify, with respect to each levee system

(A) an estimate of the number of structures and population at risk and protected by the levee system that would be adversely impacted if the levee system fails or water levels exceed the height of any levee segment within the levee system (which may be the applicable estimate included in the levee database established under section 3303 of this title , if available);

(B) the number of times the non-Federal interest has received emergency flood-fighting or repair assistance under section 701n of this title for the levee system, and the total expenditures on postflood repairs over the life of the levee system;

(C) the functionality of the levee system with regard to higher precipitation levels, including due to changing climatic conditions and extreme weather events;

(D) the potential costs and benefits (including environmental benefits and implications for levee-protected communities) from modifying the applicable levee system to restore connections with adjacent floodplains; and

(E) available studies, information, literature, or data from relevant Federal, State, or local entities.

(2) Prioritization

In conducting an assessment under subsection (a), the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, prioritize levee systems

(A) associated with an area that has been subject to flooding in two or more events in any 10-year period; and

(B) for which the non-Federal interest has received emergency flood-fighting or repair assistance under section 701n of this title with respect to such flood events.

(3) Scope

The Secretary shall ensure that an assessment under subsection (a) shall be similar in cost and scope to an initial assessment prepared by the Secretary pursuant to section 549a of this title .
