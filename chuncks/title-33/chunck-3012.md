#### § 3079. Student pre-commissioning education assistance program
##### (h) Termination of financial assistance

(1) In general

The Secretary shall terminate the assistance provided to a person under this section if

(A) the Secretary accepts a request by the person to be released from an agreement described in subsection (b)(2);

(B) the misconduct of the person results in a failure to complete the period of active duty required under the agreement; or

(C) the person fails to fulfill any term or condition of the agreement.

(2) Reimbursement

The Secretary may require a person who receives assistance described in subsection (c), (f), or (g) under an agreement entered into under subsection (b)(1)(C) to reimburse the Secretary in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total costs of the assistance provided to that person as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty the officer agreed to serve under the agreement.

(3) Waiver

The Secretary may waive the service obligation of a person through an agreement entered into under subsection (b)(1)(C) if the person

(A) becomes unqualified to serve on active duty in the commissioned officer corps of the Administration because of a circumstance not within the control of that person; or

(B) is

(i) not physically qualified for appointment; and

(ii) determined to be unqualified for service in the commissioned officer corps of the Administration because of a physical or medical condition that was not the result of the person’s own misconduct or grossly negligent conduct.

(4) Obligation as debt to United States

An obligation to reimburse the Secretary imposed under paragraph (2) is, for all purposes, a debt owed to the United States.

(5) Discharge in bankruptcy

A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 that is entered less than five years after the termination of a written agreement entered into under subsection (b)(1)(C) does not discharge the person signing the agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under paragraph (2).
