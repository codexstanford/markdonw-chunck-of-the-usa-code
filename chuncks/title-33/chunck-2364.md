#### § 2317. Wetlands
##### (d) Wetlands restoration and enhancement demonstration program

(1) Establishment and implementation

The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, is authorized to establish and implement a demonstration program for the purpose of determining the feasibility of wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation as a means of contributing to the goals established by subsection (a).

(2) Goal

The goal of the program under this subsection shall be to establish a limited number of demonstration wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation areas in districts of the Corps of Engineers for the purpose of evaluating the technical and scientific long-term feasibility of such areas as a means of contributing to the attainment of the goals established by subsection (a). Federal and State land-owning agencies and private parties may contribute to such areas.

(3) Factors to consider

In establishing the demonstration program under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider

(A) past experience with wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation;

(B) the appropriate means of measuring benefits of compensatory mitigation activities, including enhancement or restoration of existing wetlands or creation of wetlands;

(C) the appropriate geographic scope for which wetlands loss may be offset by restoration, enhancement, and creation efforts;

(D) the technical feasibility and scientific likelihood that wetlands can be successfully restored, enhanced, and created;

(E) means of establishing liability for, and long-term ownership of, wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation areas; and

(F) responsibilities for short- and long-term project monitoring.

(4) Reporting

(A) To the Chief of Engineers

The district engineer for each district of the Corps of Engineers in which a wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation area is established under this subsection shall transmit annual reports to the Chief of Engineers describing the amount and value of wetlands restored, enhanced, and created for the area and a summary of whether the area is contributing to the goal established in paragraph (2).

(B) To Congress

Not later than 3 years after November 28, 1990 , the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report evaluating the use of wetlands restoration, enhancement, and creation areas in fulfilling the goal established by paragraph (2), together with recommendations on whether or not to continue use of such areas as a means of meeting the goals established by subsection (a).

(5) Effect on other laws

Nothing in this subsection affects any requirements under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ( 33 U.S.C. 1344 ) or section 403 of this title .
