#### § 2317. Wetlands
##### (c) Non-Federal responsibilities

For the project conducted under subsection (b), the non-Federal interest shall agree

(1) to provide, without cost to the United States, all lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas necessary for construction and subsequent research and demonstration work;

(2) to hold and save the United States free from damages due to construction, operation, and maintenance of the project, except damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractors; and

(3) to operate and maintain the restored or constructed wetlands in accordance with good management practices; except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as precluding a Federal agency from agreeing to operate and maintain the restored or reconstructed wetlands. The value of the non-Federal lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas provided by the non-Federal interest shall be credited toward the non-Federal share of project design and construction costs. The non-Federal share of project design and construction costs shall be 25 percent.
