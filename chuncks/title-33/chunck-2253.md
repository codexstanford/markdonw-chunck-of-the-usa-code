#### § 2283. Fish and wildlife mitigation
##### (b) Acquisition of lands or interests in lands for mitigation

(1) After consultation with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies, the Secretary is authorized to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife resulting from any water resources project under his jurisdiction, whether completed, under construction, or to be constructed. Such mitigation may include the acquisition of lands, or interests therein, except that

(A) acquisition under this paragraph shall not be by condemnation in the case of projects completed as of November 17, 1986 , or on which at least 10 percent of the physical construction on the project has been completed as of November 17, 1986 ; and

(B) acquisition of water, or interests therein, under this paragraph, shall not be by condemnation. The Secretary, shall, under the terms of this paragraph, obligate no more than $30,000,000 in any fiscal year. With respect to any water resources project, the authority under this subsection shall not apply to measures that cost more than $7,500,000 or 10 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is greater.

(2) Whenever, after his review, the Secretary determines that such mitigation features under this subsection are likely to require condemnation under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on such proposed modification, together with his recommendations.
