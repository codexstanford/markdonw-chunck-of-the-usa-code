In any case, where two or more political subdivisions thereof, or bodies created by, a State or group of States, seek to obtain the same land, the Secretary of the Army shall give preference to that political subdivision or body whose intended use of land will, in his opinion, best promote the purposes for which the project involved was authorized.
