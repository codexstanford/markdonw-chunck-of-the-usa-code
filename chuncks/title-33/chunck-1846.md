#### § 1507. Common carrier status
##### (b) Discrimination prohibition; exceptions

A licensee is not discriminating under this section and is not subject to common carrier regulations under subsection (a) of this section when that licensee

(1) is subject to effective competition for the transportation of oil from alternative transportation systems; and

(2) sets its rates, fees, charges, and conditions of service on the basis of competition, giving consideration to other relevant business factors such as the market value of services provided, licensee’s cost of operation, and the licensee’s investment in the deepwater port and a storage facility, and components thereof, serviced directly by that deepwater port.
