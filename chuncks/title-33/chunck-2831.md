#### § 2803. Comprehensive Coastal Water Quality Monitoring Program
##### (d) Intensive coastal water quality monitoring programs

(1) In general

The Comprehensive Coastal Water Quality Monitoring Program established pursuant to this section shall include intensive coastal water quality monitoring programs developed under this subsection.

(2) Designation of intensive monitoring areas

Not later than 24 months after October 29, 1992 , and periodically thereafter, the Administrator and the Under Secretary shall, based on recommendations by the National Research Council, jointly designate coastal areas to be intensively monitored.

(3) Identification of suitable coastal areas

(A) The Administrator and the Under Secretary shall contract with the National Research Council to conduct a study to identify coastal areas suitable for the establishment of intensive coastal monitoring programs. In identifying these coastal areas, the National Research Council shall consider areas that

(i) are representatives of coastal ecosystems throughout the United States;

(ii) will provide information to assess the status and trends of coastal water quality nation-wide; and

(iii) would benefit from intensive water quality monitoring because of local management needs.

(B) In making recommendations under this paragraph, the National Research Council shall consult with Regional Research Boards established pursuant to title IV of this Act [ 16 U.S.C. 1447 et seq.].

(C) The National Research Council shall, within 18 months of October 29, 1992 , submit a report to the Administrator and the Under Secretary listing areas suitable for intensive monitoring.

(D) The Administrator and the Under Secretary, in conjunction with other Federal, State, and local authorities, shall develop and implement multi-year programs of intensive monitoring for Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays, the Gulf of Maine, the Chesapeake Bay, the Hudson-Raritan Estuary, and each area jointly designated by the Administrator and the Under Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2).

(4) Intensive coastal water quality monitoring programs

Each intensive coastal water quality monitoring program developed pursuant to this subsection shall

(A) identify water quality conditions and problems and provide information to assist in improving coastal water quality;

(B) clearly state the goals and objectives of the monitoring program and their relationship to the water quality objectives for coastal waters covered by the program;

(C) identify the water quality and biological parameters of the monitoring program and their relationship to these goals and objectives;

(D) describe the types of monitoring networks, surveys and other activities to be used to achieve these goals and objectives, using where appropriate the guidelines issued under subsection (c);

(E) survey existing Federal, State, and local coastal monitoring activities and private compliance monitoring activities in or on the coastal waters covered by the program, describe the relationship of the program to those other monitoring activities, and integrate them, as appropriate, into the intensive monitoring program;

(F) describe the data management and quality control components of the program;

(G) specify the implementation requirements for the program, including

(i) the lead Federal, State, or regional authority that will administer the program;

(ii) the public and private parties that will implement the program;

(iii) a detailed schedule for program implementation;

(iv) all Federal and State responsibilities for implementing the program; and

(v) the changes in Federal, State, and local monitoring programs necessary to implement the program;

(H) estimate the costs to Federal and State governments, and other participants, of implementing the monitoring program; and

(I) describe the methods to assess periodically the success of the monitoring program in meeting its goals and objectives, and the manner in which the program may be modified from time-to-time.

(5) Criteria for monitoring Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays

In addition to the criteria listed in paragraph (4), the intensive monitoring program for Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays shall establish baseline data on environmental phenomena (such as quantity of bacteria and quality of indigenous species, and swimmability) and determine the ecological impacts resulting from major point source discharges.

(6) Memorandum of Understanding

Prior to implementing any intensive coastal water quality monitoring program under this subsection, the Administrator and the Under Secretary shall enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to implement the intensive coastal water quality monitoring programs and may extend the memorandum  3 of Understanding to include other appropriate Federal agencies. The Memorandum of Understanding shall identify the monitoring and reporting responsibilities of each agency and shall encourage the coordination of monitoring activities.

(7) Implementation

(A) The Administrator, the Under Secretary, and the Governor of each State having waters subject to an intensive coastal water quality monitoring program developed pursuant to this subsection shall ensure compliance with that program.

(B) The Administrator and the Under Secretary are authorized to enter into cooperative agreements to provide financial assistance to non-Federal agencies and institutions to support implementation of intensive monitoring programs under this subsection. Federal financial assistance may only be provided on the condition that not less than fifty percent of the costs of the monitoring to be conducted by a non-Federal agency or institution is provided from non-Federal funds.
