### CHAPTER 49— INTEGRATED COASTAL AND OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM
#### § 3611. Assessing and modeling named storms over coastal States
##### (a) Definitions

In this section:

(1) COASTAL Formula

The term “COASTAL Formula” has the meaning given the term in section 4057(a) of title 42 .

(2) Coastal State

The term “coastal State” has the meaning given the term “coastal state” in section 1453 of title 16 , except that the term shall not apply with respect to a State or territory that has an operational wind and flood loss allocation system.

(3) Coastal waters

The term “coastal waters” has the meaning given the term in such section.

(4) Covered data

The term “covered data” means, with respect to a named storm identified by the Administrator under subsection (b)(2)(A), empirical data that are

(A) collected before, during, or after such storm; and

(B) necessary to determine magnitude and timing of wind speeds, rainfall, the barometric pressure, river flows, the extent, height, and timing of storm surge, topographic and bathymetric data, and other measures required to accurately model and assess damage from such storm.

(5) Indeterminate loss

The term “indeterminate loss” has the meaning given the term in section 4057(a) of title 42 .

(6) Named storm

The term “named storm” means any organized weather system with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of at least 39 miles per hour which the National Hurricane Center of the United States National Weather Service names as a tropical storm or a hurricane.

(7) Named Storm Event Model

The term “Named Storm Event Model” means the official meteorological and oceanographic computerized model, developed by the Administrator under subsection (b)(1)(A), which utilizes covered data to replicate the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with named storms for which post-storm assessments are conducted.

(8) Participant

The term “participant” means a Federal, State, or private entity that chooses to cooperate with the Administrator in carrying out the provisions of this section by collecting, contributing, and maintaining covered data.

(9) Post-storm assessment

The term “post-storm assessment” means a scientific assessment produced and certified by the Administrator to determine the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with a specific named storm to be used in the COASTAL Formula.

(10) State

The term “State” means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States.
