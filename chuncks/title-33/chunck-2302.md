(1) The Secretary is directed to complete an experimental program placing screens in the Salmon River in the vicinity of Salmon, Idaho, to trap frazil ice, and thus to eliminate flooding caused by ice dams in the river. Within one year of November 17, 1986 , the Secretary shall report to the Congress on the feasibility of such experiment, including consideration of any adverse environmental or social effects that could result from such experiment. If, in the Secretary’s judgment, such experiment is not feasible or acceptable, the Secretary is authorized to consult with local public interests to develop a plan that is workable and practical, and then to submit such plan to Congress.

(2) There is authorized to be appropriated $1,000,000 for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1986 , for purposes of carrying out this subsection, such sum to remain available until expended.
