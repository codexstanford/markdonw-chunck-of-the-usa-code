##### (b) General authority

(1) In general

Subject to the requirements of this section and paragraph (2), on request of any eligible entity the Secretary may negotiate and enter into an agreement on behalf of the United States to fund the design, study, and construction of an aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection project in a Reclamation State if the Secretary determines that the project is likely to improve the health of fisheries, wildlife or aquatic habitat, including through habitat restoration and improved fish passage via the removal or bypass of barriers to fish passage.

(2) Exception

With respect to an aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection project under this section that removes a dam or modifies a dam in a manner that reduces storage or diversion capacity, the Secretary may only negotiate and enter into an agreement to fund

(A) the design or study of such project if the Secretary has received consent from the owner of the applicable dam; or

(B) the construction of such project if the Secretary

(i) identifies any eligible entity that receives water or power from the facility that is under consideration for removal or modification at the time of the request;

(ii) notifies each eligible entity identified in clause (i) that the dam removal or modification project has been requested; and

(iii) does not receive, by the date that is 120 days after the date on which all eligible entities have been notified under clause (ii), written objection from 1 or more eligible entities that collectively receive ⅓ or more of the water or power delivered from the facility that is under consideration for removal or modification at the time of the request.
