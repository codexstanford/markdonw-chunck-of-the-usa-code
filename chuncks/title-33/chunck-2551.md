In any case in which the Chief of Engineers has not initiated a peer review of a project study, the Chief of Engineers shall consider, at a minimum, whether to initiate a peer review at the time that

(A) the without-project conditions are identified;

(B) the array of alternatives to be considered are identified; and

(C) the preferred alternative is identified.

(3) Reasons for timing

If the Chief of Engineers does not initiate a peer review for a project study at a time described in paragraph (2), the Chief shall

(A) not later than 7 days after the date on which the Chief of Engineers determines not to initiate a peer review

(i) notify the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives of that decision; and

(ii) make publicly available, including on the Internet, the reasons for not conducting the review; and

(B) include the reasons for not conducting the review in the decision document for the project study.

(4) Limitation on multiple peer review

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the Chief of Engineers to conduct multiple peer reviews for a project study.
