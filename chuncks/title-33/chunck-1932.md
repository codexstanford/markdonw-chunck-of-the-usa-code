### CHAPTER 33— PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS
#### § 1904. Certificates
##### (e) Detention orders; duration of detention; shipyard option

In addition to the penalties prescribed in section 1908 of this title , a ship required by the MARPOL Protocol to have a certificate

(1) which does not have a valid certificate onboard; or

(2) whose condition or whose equipment’s condition does not substantially agree with the particulars of the certificate onboard; shall be detained by order of the Secretary at the port or terminal where the violation is discovered until, in the opinion of the Secretary, the ship can proceed to sea without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment or the public health and welfare. The detention order may authorize the ship to proceed to the nearest appropriate available shipyard rather than remaining at the place where the violation was discovered.
