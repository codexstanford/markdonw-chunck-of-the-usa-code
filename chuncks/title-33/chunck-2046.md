The guidelines established under subsection (a) shall provide for the Secretary to consider, in analyzing the costs and benefits of a proposed project for flood control, the costs and benefits produced by any flood control work carried out by non-Federal interests that the Secretary determines to be compatible with the project. For purposes of the preceding sentence the Secretary may consider only work carried out after the date which is 5 years before the first obligation of funds for the reconnaissance study for such project.
