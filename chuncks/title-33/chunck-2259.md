#### § 2283. Fish and wildlife mitigation
##### (h) Programmatic mitigation plans

(1) In general

The Secretary may develop programmatic mitigation plans to address the potential impacts to ecological resources, fish, and wildlife associated with existing or future Federal water resources development projects.

(2) Use of mitigation plans

The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, use programmatic mitigation plans developed in accordance with this subsection to guide the development of a mitigation plan under subsection (d).

(3) Non-Federal plans

The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable and subject to all conditions of this subsection, use programmatic environmental plans developed by a State, a body politic of the State, which derives its powers from a State constitution, a government entity created by State legislation, or a local government, that meet the requirements of this subsection to address the potential environmental impacts of existing or future water resources development projects.

(4) Scope

A programmatic mitigation plan developed by the Secretary or an entity described in paragraph (3) to address potential impacts of existing or future water resources development projects shall, to the maximum extent practicable

(A) be developed on a regional, ecosystem, watershed, or statewide scale;

(B) include specific goals for aquatic resource and fish and wildlife habitat restoration, establishment, enhancement, or preservation;

(C) identify priority areas for aquatic resource and fish and wildlife habitat protection or restoration;

(D) include measures to protect or restore habitat connectivity;

(E) encompass multiple environmental resources within a defined geographical area or focus on a specific resource, such as aquatic resources or wildlife habitat; and

(F) address impacts from all projects in a defined geographical area or focus on a specific type of project.

(5) Consultation

The scope of the plan shall be determined by the Secretary or an entity described in paragraph (3), as appropriate, in consultation with the agency with jurisdiction over the resources being addressed in the environmental mitigation plan.

(6) Contents

A programmatic environmental mitigation plan may include

(A) an assessment of the condition of environmental resources in the geographical area covered by the plan, including an assessment of recent trends and any potential threats to those resources;

(B) an assessment of potential opportunities to improve the overall quality of environmental resources in the geographical area covered by the plan through strategic mitigation for impacts of water resources development projects;

(C) standard measures for mitigating certain types of impacts, including impacts to habitat connectivity;

(D) parameters for determining appropriate mitigation for certain types of impacts, such as mitigation ratios or criteria for determining appropriate mitigation sites;

(E) adaptive management procedures, such as protocols that involve monitoring predicted impacts over time and adjusting mitigation measures in response to information gathered through the monitoring;

(F) acknowledgment of specific statutory or regulatory requirements that must be satisfied when determining appropriate mitigation for certain types of resources; and

(G) any offsetting benefits of self-mitigating projects, such as ecosystem or resource restoration and protection.

(7) Process

Before adopting a programmatic environmental mitigation plan for use under this subsection, the Secretary shall

(A) for a plan developed by the Secretary

(i) make a draft of the plan available for review and comment by applicable environmental resource agencies and the public; and

(ii) consider any comments received from those agencies and the public on the draft plan; and

(B) for a plan developed under paragraph (3), determine, not later than 180 days after receiving the plan, whether the plan meets the requirements of paragraphs (4) through (6) and was made available for public comment.

(8) Integration with other plans

A programmatic environmental mitigation plan may be integrated with other plans, including watershed plans, ecosystem plans, species recovery plans, growth management plans, and land use plans.

(9) Consideration in project development and permitting

If a programmatic environmental mitigation plan has been developed under this subsection, any Federal agency responsible for environmental reviews, permits, or approvals for a water resources development project may use the recommendations in that programmatic environmental mitigation plan when carrying out the responsibilities of the agency under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

(10) Preservation of existing authorities

Nothing in this subsection limits the use of programmatic approaches to reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

(11) Effect

Nothing in this subsection

(A) requires the Secretary to undertake additional mitigation for existing projects for which mitigation has already been initiated, including the addition of fish passage to an existing water resources development project; or

(B) affects the mitigation responsibilities of the Secretary under any other provision of law.
