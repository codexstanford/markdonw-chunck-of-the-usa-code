#### § 3307. Assessment of Corps of Engineers levees
##### (a) In general

The Secretary shall periodically conduct assessments of federally authorized levees under the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers, to evaluate the potential Federal interest in the modification (including realignment or incorporation of natural features and nature-based features, as such terms are defined in section 2289a(a) of this title ) of levee systems to meet one or more of the following objectives:

(1) Increasing the flood risk reduction benefits of such systems.

(2) Achieving greater flood resiliency.

(3) Restoring hydrological and ecological connections with adjacent floodplains that achieve greater environmental benefits without undermining flood risk reduction or flood resiliency for levee-protected communities.
