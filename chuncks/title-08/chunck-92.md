# Title 8— ALIENS AND NATIONALITY
### CHAPTER 12— IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY
#### § 1154. Procedure for granting immigrant status
##### (k) Procedures for unmarried sons and daughters of citizens

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a petition under this section initially filed for an alien unmarried son or daughter’s classification as a family-sponsored immigrant under section 1153(a)(2)(B) of this title , based on a parent of the son or daughter being an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, if such parent subsequently becomes a naturalized citizen of the United States, such petition shall be converted to a petition to classify the unmarried son or daughter as a family-sponsored immigrant under section 1153(a)(1) of this title .

(2) Exception

Paragraph (1) does not apply if the son or daughter files with the Attorney General a written statement that he or she elects not to have such conversion occur (or if it has occurred, to have such conversion revoked). Where such an election has been made, any determination with respect to the son or daughter’s eligibility for admission as a family-sponsored immigrant shall be made as if such naturalization had not taken place.

(3) Priority date

Regardless of whether a petition is converted under this subsection or not, if an unmarried son or daughter described in this subsection was assigned a priority date with respect to such petition before such naturalization, he or she may maintain that priority date.

(4) Clarification

This subsection shall apply to a petition if it is properly filed, regardless of whether it was approved or not before such naturalization.
