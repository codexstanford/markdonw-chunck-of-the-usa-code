### CHAPTER 12— IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY
#### § 1440f. Fingerprints and other biometric information for members of the United States Armed Forces
##### (b) More timely and effective adjudication

Nothing in this section precludes an individual described in subsection (a) from submitting a new set of biometric information, including fingerprints, to the Secretary of Homeland Security with an application for naturalization. If the Secretary determines that submitting a new set of biometric information, including fingerprints, would result in more timely and effective adjudication of the individual’s naturalization application, the Secretary shall

(1) inform the individual of such determination; and

(2) provide the individual with a description of how to submit such biometric information, including fingerprints.
