(2) Remittance

The fees collected under paragraph (1) shall be remitted by the alien pursuant to a schedule established by the Attorney General for immediate deposit and availability as described under section 1356(m) of this title .

(A) Establishment of amount

The Attorney General shall establish the amount of the fee to be imposed on, and collected from, an alien under paragraph (1).
