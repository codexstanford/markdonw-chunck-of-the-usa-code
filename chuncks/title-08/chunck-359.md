### CHAPTER 12— IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY
#### § 1252. Judicial review of orders of removal
##### (d) Review of final orders

A court may review a final order of removal only if

(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right, and

(2) another court has not decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.
