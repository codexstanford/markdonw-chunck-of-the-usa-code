(B) the alien did not invest the requisite capital; or

(C) the alien was otherwise not conforming to the requirements of section 1153(b)(5) of this title , then the Secretary of Homeland Security shall so notify the alien involved and, subject to paragraph (2), shall terminate the permanent resident status of the alien (and the alien spouse and alien child) involved as of the date of the determination.
