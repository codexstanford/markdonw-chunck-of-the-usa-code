### CHAPTER 403— JUVENILE DELINQUENCY
#### § 5037. Dispositional hearing
###### (b) The term for which probation may be ordered for a juvenile found to be a juvenile delinquent may not extend

(1) in the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old, beyond the lesser of

(A) the date when the juvenile becomes twenty-one years old; or

(B) the maximum term that would be authorized by section 3561(c) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult; or

(2) in the case of a juvenile who is between eighteen and twenty-one years old, beyond the lesser of

(A) three years; or

(B) the maximum term that would be authorized by section 3561(c) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult. The provisions dealing with probation set forth in sections 3563 and 3564 are applicable to an order placing a juvenile on probation. If the juvenile violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation, the court may, after a dispositional hearing and after considering any pertinent policy statements promulgated by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28 , revoke the term of probation and order a term of official detention. The term of official detention authorized upon revocation of probation shall not exceed the terms authorized in section 5037(c)(2)(A) and (B). The application of sections 5037(c)(2)(A) and (B) shall be determined based upon the age of the juvenile at the time of the disposition of the revocation proceeding. If a juvenile is over the age of 21 years old at the time of the revocation proceeding, the mandatory revocation provisions of section 3565(b) are applicable. A disposition of a juvenile who is over the age of 21 years shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 5037(c)(2), except that in the case of a juvenile who if convicted as an adult would be convicted of a Class A, B, or C felony, no term of official detention may continue beyond the juvenile’s 26th birthday, and in any other case, no term of official detention may continue beyond the juvenile’s 24th birthday. A term of official detention may include a term of juvenile delinquent supervision.
