### CHAPTER 223— WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE
#### § 3509. Child victims’ and child witnesses’ rights
###### (e) Closing the Courtroom .

When a child testifies the court may order the exclusion from the courtroom of all persons, including members of the press, who do not have a direct interest in the case. Such an order may be made if the court determines on the record that requiring the child to testify in open court would cause substantial psychological harm to the child or would result in the child’s inability to effectively communicate. Such an order shall be narrowly tailored to serve the Government’s specific compelling interest.
