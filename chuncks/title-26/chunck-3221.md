### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 1092. Straddles
##### (a) Recognition of loss in case of straddles, etc.

(1) Limitation on recognition of loss

(A) In general

Any loss with respect to 1 or more positions shall be taken into account for any taxable year only to the extent that the amount of such loss exceeds the unrecognized gain (if any) with respect to 1 or more positions which were offsetting positions with respect to 1 or more positions from which the loss arose.

(B) Carryover of loss

Any loss which may not be taken into account under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall, subject to the limitations under subparagraph (A), be treated as sustained in the succeeding taxable year.

(2) Special rule for identified straddles

(A) In general

In the case of any straddle which is an identified straddle

(i) paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to positions comprising the identified straddle,

(ii) if there is any loss with respect to any position of the identified straddle, the basis of each of the offsetting positions in the identified straddle shall be increased by an amount which bears the same ratio to the loss as the unrecognized gain with respect to such offsetting position bears to the aggregate unrecognized gain with respect to all such offsetting positions,

(iii) if the application of clause (ii) does not result in an increase in the basis of any offsetting position in the identified straddle, the basis of each of the offsetting positions in the identified straddle shall be increased in a manner which

(I) is reasonable, consistent with the purposes of this paragraph, and consistently applied by the taxpayer, and

(II) results in an aggregate increase in the basis of such offsetting positions which is equal to the loss described in clause (ii), and

(iv) any loss described in clause (ii) shall not otherwise be taken into account for purposes of this title.

(B) Identified straddle

The term “identified straddle” means any straddle

(i) which is clearly identified on the taxpayer’s records as an identified straddle before the earlier of

(I) the close of the day on which the straddle is acquired, or

(II) such time as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.

(ii) to the extent provided by regulations, the value of each position of which (in the hands of the taxpayer immediately before the creation of the straddle) is not less than the basis of such position in the hands of the taxpayer at the time the straddle is created, and

(iii) which is not part of a larger straddle. A straddle shall be treated as clearly identified for purposes of clause (i) only if such identification includes an identification of the positions in the straddle which are offsetting with respect to other positions in the straddle.

(C) Application to liabilities and obligations

Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph with respect to any position which is, or has been, a liability or obligation.

(D) Regulations

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this paragraph. Such regulations or other guidance may specify the proper methods for clearly identifying a straddle as an identified straddle (and for identifying the positions comprising such straddle), the rules for the application of this section to a taxpayer which fails to comply with those identification requirements, the rules for the application of this section to a position which is or has been a liability or obligation, methods of loss allocation which satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iii), and the ordering rules in cases where a taxpayer disposes (or otherwise ceases to be the holder) of any part of any position which is part of an identified straddle.

(3) Unrecognized gain

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “unrecognized gain” means

(i) in the case of any position held by the taxpayer as of the close of the taxable year, the amount of gain which would be taken into account with respect to such position if such position were sold on the last business day of such taxable year at its fair market value, and

(ii) in the case of any position with respect to which, as of the close of the taxable year, gain has been realized but not recognized, the amount of gain so realized.

(B) Special rule for identified straddles

For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), the unrecognized gain with respect to any offsetting position shall be the excess of the fair market value of the position at the time of the determination over the fair market value of the position at the time the taxpayer identified the position as a position in an identified straddle.

(C) Reporting of gain

(i) In general

Each taxpayer shall disclose to the Secretary, at such time and in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations

(I) each position (whether or not part of a straddle) with respect to which, as of the close of the taxable year, there is unrecognized gain, and

(II) the amount of such unrecognized gain.

(ii) Reports not required in certain cases

Clause (i) shall not apply

(I) to any position which is part of an identified straddle,

(II) to any position which, with respect to the taxpayer, is property described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1221(a) or to any position which is part of a hedging transaction (as defined in section 1256(e)), or

(III) with respect to any taxable year if no loss on a position (including a regulated futures contract) has been sustained during such taxable year or if the only loss sustained on such position is a loss described in subclause (II).
