(1) Taxes

There shall be allowed as a deduction Federal income and excess profits taxes and income, war profits, and excess profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States (to the extent not allowable as a deduction under section 275(a)(4)), accrued during the taxable year or deemed to be paid by a domestic corporation under section 960 for the taxable year, but not including the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531 or the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541.

(4) Net operating loss

The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.

(5) Capital losses

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the net capital loss for the taxable year (determined without regard to paragraph (7)(A)).

(B) Recapture of previous deductions for capital gains

The aggregate amount allowable as a deduction under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall be reduced by the lesser of

(i) the nonrecaptured capital gains deductions, or

(ii) the amount of the accumulated earnings and profits of the corporation as of the close of the preceding taxable year.

(C) Nonrecaptured capital gains deductions

For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term “nonrecaptured capital gains deductions” means the excess of

(i) the aggregate amount allowable as a deduction under paragraph (6) for preceding taxable years beginning after July 18, 1984 , over

(ii) the aggregate of the reductions under subparagraph (B) for preceding taxable years.

(6) Net capital gains

(A) In general

There shall be allowed as a deduction

(i) the net capital gain for the taxable year (determined with the application of paragraph (7)), reduced by

(ii) the taxes attributable to such net capital gain.

(B) Attributable taxes

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the taxes attributable to the net capital gain shall be an amount equal to the difference between

(i) the taxes imposed by this subtitle (except the tax imposed by this part) for the taxable year, and

(ii) such taxes computed for such year without including in taxable income the net capital gain for the taxable year (determined without the application of paragraph (7)).

(7) Capital loss carryovers

(A) Unlimited carryforward

The net capital loss for any taxable year shall be treated as a short-term capital loss in the next taxable year.

(C) Earnings and profits

For purposes of subchapter C, the accumulated earnings and profits at any time shall not be less than they would be if this subsection had applied to the computation of earnings and profits for all taxable years beginning after July 18, 1984 .

(9) Special rule for capital gains and losses of foreign corporations

In the case of a foreign corporation, paragraph (6) shall be applied by taking into account only gains and losses which are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and are not exempt from tax under treaty.

(10) Controlled foreign corporations

There shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of the corporation’s income for the taxable year which is included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a). In the case of any corporation the accumulated taxable income of which would (but for this sentence) be determined without allowance of any deductions, the deduction under this paragraph shall be allowed and shall be appropriately adjusted to take into account any deductions which reduced such inclusion.
