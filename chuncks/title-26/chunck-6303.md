For purposes of this section

(1) Additional information

As a condition of, and prior to, any transfer of any portion of an eligible credit pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary may require such information (including, in such form or manner as is determined appropriate by the Secretary, such information returns) or registration as the Secretary deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section.

(2) Excessive credit transfer

(A) In general

In the case of any portion of an eligible credit which is transferred to a transferee taxpayer pursuant to subsection (a) which the Secretary determines constitutes an excessive credit transfer, the tax imposed on the transferee taxpayer by chapter 1 (regardless of whether such entity would otherwise be subject to tax under such chapter) for the taxable year in which such determination is made shall be increased by an amount equal to the sum of

(i) the amount of such excessive credit transfer, plus

(ii) an amount equal to 20 percent of such excessive credit transfer.

(B) Reasonable cause

Subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not apply if the transferee taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the excessive credit transfer resulted from reasonable cause.

(C) Excessive credit transfer defined

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “excessive credit transfer” means, with respect to a facility or property for which an election is made under subsection (a) for any taxable year, an amount equal to the excess of

(i) the amount of the eligible credit claimed by the transferee taxpayer with respect to such facility or property for such taxable year, over

(ii) the amount of such credit which, without application of this section, would be otherwise allowable under this title with respect to such facility or property for such taxable year.

(3) Basis reduction; notification of recapture

In the case of any election under subsection (a) with respect to any portion of an eligible credit described in clauses (ix) through (xi) of subsection (f)(1)(A)

(A) subsection (c) of section 50 shall apply to the applicable investment credit property (as defined in subsection (a)(5) of such section) as if such eligible credit was allowed to the eligible taxpayer, and

(B) if, during any taxable year, the applicable investment credit property (as defined in subsection (a)(5) of section 50) is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be investment credit property with respect to the eligible taxpayer, before the close of the recapture period (as described in subsection (a)(1) of such section)

(i) such eligible taxpayer shall provide notice of such occurrence to the transferee taxpayer (in such form and manner as the Secretary shall prescribe), and

(ii) the transferee taxpayer shall provide notice of the recapture amount (as defined in subsection (c)(2) of such section), if any, to the eligible taxpayer (in such form and manner as the Secretary shall prescribe).

(4) Prohibition on election or transfer with respect to progress expenditures

This section shall not apply with respect to any amount of an eligible credit which is allowed pursuant to rules similar to the rules of subsections (c)(4) and (d) of section 46 (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990).
