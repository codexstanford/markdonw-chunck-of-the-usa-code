##### (b) Deemed allocation to certain lifetime direct skips

(1) In general

If any individual makes a direct skip during his lifetime, any unused portion of such individual’s GST exemption shall be allocated to the property transferred to the extent necessary to make the inclusion ratio for such property zero. If the amount of the direct skip exceeds such unused portion, the entire unused portion shall be allocated to the property transferred.

(2) Unused portion

For purposes of paragraph (1), the unused portion of an individual’s GST exemption is that portion of such exemption which has not previously been allocated by such individual (or treated as allocated under paragraph (1) or subsection (c)(1)).

(3) Subsection not to apply in certain cases

An individual may elect to have this subsection not apply to a transfer.
