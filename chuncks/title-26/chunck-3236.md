(1) In general

If any amount included in gross income by reason of holding an interest in a pass-thru entity meets the requirements of paragraph (2)

(A) such amount shall be treated as gain described in subsection (a), and

(B) for purposes of applying subsection (b), such amount shall be treated as gain from a disposition of stock in the corporation issuing the stock disposed of by the pass-thru entity and the taxpayer’s proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the pass-thru entity in such stock shall be taken into account.

(2) Requirements

An amount meets the requirements of this paragraph if

(A) such amount is attributable to gain on the sale or exchange by the pass-thru entity of stock which is qualified small business stock in the hands of such entity (determined by treating such entity as an individual) and which was held by such entity for more than 5 years, and

(B) such amount is includible in the gross income of the taxpayer by reason of the holding of an interest in such entity which was held by the taxpayer on the date on which such pass-thru entity acquired such stock and at all times thereafter before the disposition of such stock by such pass-thru entity.

(3) Limitation based on interest originally held by taxpayer

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any amount to the extent such amount exceeds the amount to which paragraph (1) would have applied if such amount were determined by reference to the interest the taxpayer held in the pass-thru entity on the date the qualified small business stock was acquired.

(4) Pass-thru entity

For purposes of this subsection, the term “pass-thru entity” means
