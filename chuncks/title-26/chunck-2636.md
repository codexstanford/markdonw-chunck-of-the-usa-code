#### § 846. Discounted unpaid losses defined
##### (d) Loss payment pattern

(1) In general

For each determination year, the Secretary shall determine a loss payment pattern for each line of business by reference to the historical loss payment pattern applicable to such line of business. Any loss payment pattern determined by the Secretary shall apply to the accident year ending with the determination year and to each of the 4 succeeding accident years.

(2) Method of determination

Determinations under paragraph (1) for any determination year shall be made by the Secretary

(A) by using the aggregate experience reported on the annual statements of insurance companies,

(B) on the basis of the most recent published aggregate data from such annual statements relating to loss payment patterns available on the 1st day of the determination year,

(C) as if all losses paid or treated as paid during any year are paid in the middle of such year, and

(D) in accordance with the computational rules prescribed in paragraph (3).

(3) Computational rules

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the loss payment pattern for any line of business shall be based on the assumption that all losses are paid

(i) during the accident year and the 3 calendar years following the accident year, or

(ii) in the case of any line of business reported in the schedule or schedules of the annual statement relating to auto liability, other liability, medical malpractice, workers’ compensation, and multiple peril lines, during the accident year and the 10 calendar years following the accident year.

(B) Treatment of certain losses

(i) 3-year loss payment pattern

In the case of any line of business not described in subparagraph (A)(ii), losses paid after the 1st year following the accident year shall be treated as paid equally in the 2nd and 3rd year following the accident year.

(ii) 10-year loss payment pattern

(I) In general

The period taken into account under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be extended to the extent required under subclause (II).

(II) Computation of extension

The amount of losses which would have been treated as paid in the 10th year after the accident year shall be treated as paid in such 10th year and each subsequent year in an amount equal to the amount of the average of the losses treated as paid in the 7th, 8th, and 9th years after the accident year (or, if lesser, the portion of the unpaid losses not theretofore taken into account). To the extent such unpaid losses have not been treated as paid before the 24th year after the accident year, they shall be treated as paid in such 24th year.

(4) Determination year

For purposes of this section, the term “determination year” means calendar year 1987 and each 5th calendar year thereafter.
