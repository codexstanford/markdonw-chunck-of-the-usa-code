#### § 192. Contributions to black lung benefit trust
##### (c) Special rules

(1) Method of determining amounts referred to in subsection (b)

(A) In general

The amounts described in subsection (b) shall be determined by using reasonable actuarial methods and assumptions which are not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

(B) Funding period

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the funding period for purposes of subsection (b)(1) shall be the greater of

(i) the average remaining working life of miners who are present employees of the taxpayer, or

(ii) 10 taxable years. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “miner” has the same meaning as such term has when used in section 402(d) of the Black Lung Benefits Act ( 30 U.S.C. 902(d) ).

(C) Different funding periods

To the extent that

(i) regulations prescribed by the Secretary provide for a different period, or

(ii) the Secretary consents to a different period proposed by the taxpayer, such different period shall be substituted for the funding period provided in subparagraph (B).

(2) Benefit payments taken into account

In determining the amounts described in subsection (b), only those black lung benefit claims the payment of which is expected to be made from the trust shall be taken into account.

(3) Time when contributions deemed made

For purposes of this section, a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment of a contribution on the last day of a taxable year if the payment is on account of that taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for that taxable year (including extensions thereof).

(4) Contributions to be in cash or certain other items

No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) with respect to any contribution to a trust described in section 501(c)(21) other than a contribution in cash or in items in which such trust may invest under subclause (II) of section 501(c)(21)(A)(ii).

(5) Denial of section 162 deduction with respect to liability

No deduction shall be allowed under section 162(a) with respect to any liability taken into account in determining the deduction under subsection (a) of this section of the taxpayer (or a predecessor).
