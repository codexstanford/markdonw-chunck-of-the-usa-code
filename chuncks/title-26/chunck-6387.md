(1) Credit limited to certain employment taxes

The credit allowed by subsection (a) with respect to any calendar quarter shall not exceed the tax imposed by section 3111(b), or so much of the taxes imposed under section 3221(a) as are attributable to the rate in effect under section 3111(b), for such calendar quarter (reduced by any credits allowed against such taxes under sections 3131, 3132, and 3134) on the wages paid with respect to the employment of all employees of the employer.

(2) Refundability of excess credit

(A) Credit is refundable

If the amount of the credit under subsection (a) exceeds the limitation of paragraph (1) for any calendar quarter, such excess shall be treated as an overpayment that shall be refunded under sections 6402(a) and 6413(b).

(B) Credit may be advanced

In anticipation of the credit, including the refundable portion under subparagraph (A), the credit may be advanced, according to forms and instructions provided by the Secretary, up to an amount calculated under subsection (a) through the end of the most recent payroll period in the quarter.

(C) Treatment of deposits

The Secretary shall waive any penalty under section 6656 for any failure to make a deposit of the tax imposed by section 3111(b), or so much of the taxes imposed under section 3221(a) as are attributable to the rate in effect under section 3111(b), if the Secretary determines that such failure was due to the anticipation of the credit allowed under this section.

(D) Treatment of payments

For purposes of section 1324 of title 31 , United States Code, any amounts due to an employer under this paragraph shall be treated in the same manner as a refund due from a credit provision referred to in subsection (b)(2) of such section.

(3) Overstatements

Any overstatement of the credit to which a person is entitled under this section (and any amount paid by the Secretary as a result of such overstatement) shall be treated as an underpayment by such person of the taxes described in paragraph (1) and may be assessed and collected by the Secretary in the same manner as such taxes.
