(II) such year of service was completed in a plan year beginning before January 1, 1984 .

(iii) Exception for plan under which no key employee (or former key employee) benefits for plan year

For purposes of determining an employee’s years of service with the employer, any service with the employer shall be disregarded to the extent that such service occurs during a plan year when the plan benefits (within the meaning of section 410(b)) no key employee or former key employee.
