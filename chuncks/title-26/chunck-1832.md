For purposes of this section

(1) In general

The term “funding target attainment percentage” has the same meaning given such term by section 430(d)(2).

(2) Adjusted funding target attainment percentage

The term “adjusted funding target attainment percentage” means the funding target attainment percentage which is determined under paragraph (1) by increasing each of the amounts under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 430(d)(2) by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities for employees other than highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)) which were made by the plan during the preceding 2 plan years.

(3) Application to plans which are fully funded without regard to reductions for funding balances

In the case of a plan for any plan year, if the funding target attainment percentage is 100 percent or more (determined without regard to the reduction in the value of assets under section 430(f)(4)), the funding target attainment percentage for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be determined without regard to such reduction.
