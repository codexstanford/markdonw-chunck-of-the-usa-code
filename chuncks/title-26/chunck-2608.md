### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 832. Insurance company taxable income
##### (f) Interinsurers

In the case of a mutual insurance company which is an interinsurer or reciprocal underwriter

(1) there shall be allowed as a deduction the increase for the taxable year in savings credited to subscriber accounts, or

(2) there shall be included as an item of gross income the decrease for the taxable year in savings credited to subscriber accounts. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “savings credited to subscriber accounts” means such portion of the surplus as is credited to the individual accounts of subscribers before the 16th day of the 3rd month following the close of the taxable year, but only if the company would be obligated to pay such amount promptly to such subscriber if he terminated his contract at the close of the company’s taxable year. For purposes of determining his taxable income, the subscriber shall treat any such savings credited to his account as a dividend paid or declared.
