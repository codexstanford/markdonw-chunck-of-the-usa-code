#### § 4942. Taxes on failure to distribute income
##### (a) Initial tax

There is hereby imposed on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, which has not been distributed before the first day of the second (or any succeeding) taxable year following such taxable year (if such first day falls within the taxable period), a tax equal to 30 percent of the amount of such income remaining undistributed at the beginning of such second (or succeeding) taxable year. The tax imposed by this subsection shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation

(1) for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), or

(2) to the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of an incorrect valuation of assets under subsection (e), if

(A) the failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,

(B) such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of subsection (g)) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in subsection (j)(2)),

(C) the foundation notifies the Secretary that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subparagraph (B)) to correct such failure, and

(D) such distribution is treated under subsection (h)(2) as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this paragraph) have been imposed under this subsection.
