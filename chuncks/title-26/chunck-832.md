(2) Election by nongovernmental owners

A facility shall be treated as described in subsection (a)(11) only if any owner of such facility which is not a governmental unit irrevocably elects not to claim

(B) any credit under this subtitle, with respect to the property to be financed by the net proceeds of the issue.

(3) Use of proceeds

A bond issued as part of an issue described in subsection (a)(11) shall not be considered an exempt facility bond unless any proceeds not used within a 3-year period of the date of the issuance of such bond are used (not later than 6 months after the close of such period) to redeem bonds which are part of such issue.
