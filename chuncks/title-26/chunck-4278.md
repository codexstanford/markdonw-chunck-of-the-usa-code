## Subtitle C— Employment Taxes
### CHAPTER 24— COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX AT SOURCE ON WAGES
#### § 3402. Income tax collected at source
##### (o) Extension of withholding to certain payments other than wages

(1) General rule

For purposes of this chapter (and so much of subtitle F as relates to this chapter)

(A) any supplemental unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual,

(B) any payment of an annuity to an individual, if at the time the payment is made a request that such annuity be subject to withholding under this chapter is in effect, and

(C) any payment to an individual of sick pay which does not constitute wages (determined without regard to this subsection), if at the time the payment is made a request that such sick pay be subject to withholding under this chapter is in effect, shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period.

(2) Definitions

(A) Supplemental unemployment compensation benefits

For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “supplemental unemployment compensation benefits” means amounts which are paid to an employee, pursuant to a plan to which the employer is a party, because of an employee’s involuntary separation from employment (whether or not such separation is temporary), resulting directly from a reduction in force, the discontinuance of a plant or operation, or other similar conditions, but only to the extent such benefits are includible in the employee’s gross income.

(B) Annuity

For purposes of this subsection, the term “annuity” means any amount paid to an individual as a pension or annuity.

(C) Sick pay

For purposes of this subsection, the term “sick pay” means any amount which

(i) is paid to an employee pursuant to a plan to which the employer is a party, and

(ii) constitutes remuneration or a payment in lieu of remuneration for any period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injuries.

(3) Amount withheld from annuity payments or sick pay

If a payee makes a request that an annuity or any sick pay be subject to withholding under this chapter, the amount to be deducted and withheld under this chapter from any payment to which such request applies shall be an amount (not less than a minimum amount determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) specified by the payee in such request. The amount deducted and withheld with respect to a payment which is greater or less than a full payment shall bear the same relation to the specified amount as such payment bears to a full payment.

(4) Request for withholding

A request that an annuity or any sick pay be subject to withholding under this chapter

(A) shall be made by the payee in writing to the person making the payments and shall contain the social security number of the payee,

(B) shall specify the amount to be deducted and withheld from each full payment, and

(C) shall take effect

(i) in the case of sick pay, with respect to payments made more than 7 days after the date on which such request is furnished to the payor, or

(ii) in the case of an annuity, at such time (after the date on which such request is furnished to the payor) as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe. Such a request may be changed or terminated by furnishing to the person making the payments a written statement of change or termination which shall take effect in the same manner as provided in subparagraph (C). At the election of the payor, any such request (or statement of change or revocation) may take effect earlier than as provided in subparagraph (C).

(5) Special rule for sick pay paid pursuant to certain collective-bargaining agreements

In the case of any sick pay paid pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers which contains a provision specifying that this paragraph is to apply to sick pay paid pursuant to such agreement and contains a provision for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld from each payment of such sick pay

(A) the requirement of paragraph (1)(C) that a request for withholding be in effect shall not apply, and

(B) except as provided in subsection (n), the amounts to be deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be determined in accordance with such agreement. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to sick pay paid pursuant to any agreement to any individual unless the social security number of such individual is furnished to the payor and the payor is furnished with such information as is necessary to determine whether the payment is pursuant to the agreement and to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld.

(6) Coordination with withholding on designated distributions under section 3405

This subsection shall not apply to any amount which is a designated distribution (within the meaning of section 3405(e)(1)).
