##### (d) Loans defined

For purposes of this section

(1) Qualifying real property loans

The term “qualifying real property loan” means any loan secured by an interest in improved real property or secured by an interest in real property which is to be improved out of the proceeds of the loan, but such term does not include

(A) any loan evidenced by a security (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C));

(B) any loan, whether or not evidenced by a security (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C)), the primary obligor on which is

(i) a government or political subdivision or instrumentality thereof;

(ii) a bank (as defined in section 581); or

(iii) another member of the same affiliated group;

(C) any loan, to the extent secured by a deposit in or share of the taxpayer; or

(D) any loan which, within a 60-day period beginning in one taxable year of the creditor and ending in its next taxable year, is made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of, unless the transactions by which such loan was made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of are established to be for bona fide business purposes. For purposes of subparagraph (B)(iii), the term “affiliated group” has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a); except that (i) the phrase “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1504(a), and (ii) all corporations shall be treated as includible corporations (without any exclusion under section 1504(b)).

(2) Nonqualifying loans

The term “nonqualifying loan” means any loan which is not a qualifying real property loan.

(3) Loan

The term “loan” means debt, as the term “debt” is used in section 166.

(4) Treatment of interests in REMIC’s

A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are qualifying real property loans (determined as if the taxpayer held the assets of the REMIC), such interest shall be so treated only in the proportion which the assets of such REMIC consist of such loans. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest in another REMIC held by such REMIC shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that if such REMIC’s are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as 1 REMIC for purposes of this paragraph.
