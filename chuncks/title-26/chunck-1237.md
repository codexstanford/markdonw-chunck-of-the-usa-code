(2) Treatment

In the case of property described in paragraph (1), any income or gain realized on the sale or exchange of such property shall be treated as

(A) for such amount of the income or gain as is equal to or less than the amount of income which would be included in income at the time of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer’s election under this subsection, ordinary income, and

(B) for any amounts of the income or gain which are in excess of the amount of income which would be included in income at the time of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer’s election under this subsection, having the same character as if this subsection did not apply.

(3) Election

(A) In general

For each taxable year, a Settlement Trust may elect to apply this subsection for any property described in paragraph (1) which was contributed during such year. Any property to which the election applies shall be identified and described with reasonable particularity on the income tax return or an amendment or supplement to the return of the Settlement Trust, with such election to have effect solely for such taxable year.

(B) Revocation

Any election made by a Settlement Trust pursuant to this subsection may be revoked pursuant to a timely filed amendment or supplement to the income tax return of such Settlement Trust.

(C) Certain dispositions

(i) In general

In the case of any property for which an election is in effect under this subsection and which is disposed of within the first taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which such property was contributed to the Settlement Trust

(I) this section shall be applied as if the election under this subsection had not been made,

(II) any income or gain which would have been included in the year of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer’s election under this subsection shall be included in income for the taxable year of such contribution, and

(III) the Settlement Trust shall pay any increase in tax resulting from such inclusion, including any applicable interest, and increased by 10 percent of the amount of such increase with interest.

(ii) Assessment

Notwithstanding section 6501(a), any amount described in subclause (III) of clause (i) may be assessed, or a proceeding in court with respect to such amount may be initiated without assessment, within 4 years after the date on which the return making the election under this subsection for such property was filed.
