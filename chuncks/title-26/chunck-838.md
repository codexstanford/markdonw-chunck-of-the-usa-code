#### § 142. Exempt facility bond
##### (o) Qualified carbon dioxide capture facility

(1) In general

For purposes of subsection (a)(17), the term “qualified carbon dioxide capture facility” means

(A) the eligible components of an industrial carbon dioxide facility, and

(B) a direct air capture facility (as defined in section 45Q(e)(3)).

(2) Definitions

For purposes of this subsection:

(A) Eligible component

(i) In general

The term “eligible component” means any equipment which is installed in an industrial carbon dioxide facility that satisfies the requirements under paragraph (3) and which is

(I) used for the purpose of capture, treatment and purification, compression, transportation, or on-site storage of carbon dioxide produced by the industrial carbon dioxide facility, or

(II) integral or functionally related and subordinate to a process which converts a solid or liquid product from coal, petroleum residue, biomass, or other materials which are recovered for their energy or feedstock value into a synthesis gas composed primarily of carbon dioxide and hydrogen for direct use or subsequent chemical or physical conversion.

(ii) Definitions

For purposes of this subparagraph

(I) Biomass

(aa) In general

The term “biomass” means any

(AA) agricultural or plant waste,

(BB) byproduct of wood or paper mill operations, including lignin in spent pulping liquors, and

(CC) other products of forestry maintenance.

(bb) Exclusion

The term “biomass” does not include paper which is commonly recycled.

(II) Coal

The term “coal” means anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite, and peat.

(B) Industrial carbon dioxide facility

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), the term “industrial carbon dioxide facility” means a facility that emits carbon dioxide (including from any fugitive emissions source) that is created as a result of any of the following processes:

(I) Fuel combustion.

(II) Gasification.

(III) Bioindustrial.

(IV) Fermentation.

(V) Any manufacturing industry relating to

(aa) chemicals,

(bb) fertilizers,

(cc) glass,

(dd) steel,

(ee) petroleum residues,

(ff) forest products,

(gg) agriculture, including feedlots and dairy operations, and

(hh) transportation grade liquid fuels.

(ii) Exceptions

For purposes of clause (i), an industrial carbon dioxide facility shall not include

(I) any geological gas facility, or

(II) any air separation unit that

(aa) does not qualify as gasification equipment, or

(bb) is not a necessary component of an oxy-fuel combustion process.

(iii) Definitions

For purposes of this subparagraph

(I) Petroleum residue

The term “petroleum residue” means the carbonized product of high-boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained in petroleum processing.

(II) Geological gas facility

The term “geological gas facility” means a facility that

(aa) produces a raw product consisting of gas or mixed gas and liquid from a geological formation,

(bb) transports or removes impurities from such product, or

(cc) separates such product into its constituent parts.

(3) Special rule for facilities with less than 65 percent capture and storage percentage

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the eligible components of an industrial carbon dioxide facility satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such eligible components are designed to have a capture and storage percentage (as determined under subparagraph (C)) that is equal to or greater than 65 percent.

(B) Exception

In the case of an industrial carbon dioxide facility designed with a capture and storage percentage that is less than 65 percent, the percentage of the cost of the eligible components installed in such facility that may be financed with tax-exempt bonds may not be greater than the designed capture and storage percentage.

(C) Capture and storage percentage

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the capture and storage percentage shall be an amount, expressed as a percentage, equal to the quotient of

(I) the total metric tons of carbon dioxide designed to be annually captured, transported, and injected into

(aa) a facility for geologic storage, or

(bb) an enhanced oil or gas recovery well followed by geologic storage, divided by

(II) the total metric tons of carbon dioxide which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere each year as industrial emission of greenhouse gas if the eligible components were not installed in the industrial carbon dioxide facility.

(ii) Limited application of eligible components

In the case of eligible components that are designed to capture carbon dioxide solely from specific sources of emissions or portions thereof within an industrial carbon dioxide facility, the capture and storage percentage under this subparagraph shall be determined based only on such specific sources of emissions or portions thereof.

(4) Regulations

The Secretary shall issue such regulations or other guidance as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection, including methods for determining costs attributable to an eligible component for purposes of paragraph (3)(A).
