## Subtitle F— Procedure and Administration
### CHAPTER 76— JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
#### § 7481. Date when Tax Court decision becomes final
##### (d) Decisions relating to estate tax extended under section 6166

If with respect to a decedent’s estate subject to a decision of the Tax Court

(1) the time for payment of an amount of tax imposed by chapter 11 is extended under section 6166, and

(2) there is treated as an administrative expense under section 2053 either

(A) any amount of interest which a decedent’s estate pays on any portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 on such estate for which the time of payment is extended under section 6166, or

(B) interest on any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax imposed by a State on such estate during the period of the extension of time for payment under section 6166, then, upon a motion by the petitioner in such case in which such time for payment of tax has been extended under section 6166, the Tax Court may reopen the case solely to modify the Court’s decision to reflect such estate’s entitlement to a deduction for such administration expenses under section 2053 and may hold further trial solely with respect to the claim for such deduction if, within the discretion of the Tax Court, such a hearing is deemed necessary. An order of the Tax Court disposing of a motion under this subsection shall be reviewable in the same manner as a decision of the Tax Court, but only with respect to the matters determined in such order.
