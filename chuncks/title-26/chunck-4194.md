## Subtitle C— Employment Taxes
### CHAPTER 23— FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX ACT
#### § 3302. Credits against tax
##### (g) Credit reduction not to apply when State makes certain repayments

(1) In general

In the case of any State which meets requirements of paragraph (2) with respect to any taxable year, subsection (c)(2) shall not apply to such taxable year; except that such taxable year (and January 1 of such taxable year) shall (except as provided in subsection (f)(3)) be taken into account for purposes of applying subsection (c)(2) to succeeding taxable years.

(2) Requirements

The requirements of this paragraph are met by any State with respect to any taxable year if the Secretary of Labor determines that

(A) the repayments during the 1-year period ending on November 9 of such taxable year made by such State of advances under title XII of the Social Security Act are not less than the sum of

(i) the potential additional taxes for such taxable year, and

(ii) any advances made to such State during such 1-year period under such title XII,

(B) there will be sufficient amounts in the State unemployment fund to pay all compensation during the 3-month period beginning on November 1 of such taxable year without receiving any advance under title XII of the Social Security Act, and

(C) there is a net increase in the solvency of the State unemployment compensation system for the taxable year attributable to changes made in the State law after the date on which the first advance taken into account in determining the amount of the potential additional taxes was made (or, if later, after the date of the enactment of this subsection) and such net increase equals or exceeds the potential additional taxes for such taxable year.

(3) Definitions

For purposes of paragraph (2)

(A) Potential additional taxes

The term “potential additional taxes” means, with respect to any State for any taxable year, the aggregate amount of the additional tax which would be payable under this chapter for such taxable year by all taxpayers subject to the unemployment compensation law of such State for such taxable year if paragraph (2) of subsection (c) had applied to such taxable year and any preceding taxable year without regard to this subsection but with regard to subsection (f).

(B) Treatment of certain reductions

Any reduction in the State’s balance under section 901(d)(1) of the Social Security Act shall not be treated as a repayment made by such State.

(4) Reports

The Secretary of Labor may require a State to furnish such information at such time and in such manner as may be necessary for purposes of paragraph (2).
