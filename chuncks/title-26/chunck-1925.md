In the case of an eligible deferred compensation plan of an employer described in subsection (e)(1)(B)

(A) Total amount payable is dollar limit or less

The total amount payable to a participant under the plan shall not be treated as made available merely because the participant may elect to receive such amount (or the plan may distribute such amount without the participant’s consent) if
