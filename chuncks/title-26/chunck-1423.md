#### § 312. Effect on earnings and profits
##### (k) Effect of depreciation on earnings and profits

(1) General rule

For purposes of computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972 , the allowance for depreciation (and amortization, if any) shall be deemed to be the amount which would be allowable for such year if the straight line method of depreciation had been used for each taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972 .

(2) Exception

If for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used by the taxpayer which the Secretary has determined results in a reasonable allowance under section 167(a) and which is the unit-of-production method or other method not expressed in a term of years, then the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for such year shall be determined under the method so used (in lieu of the straight line method).

(3) Exception for tangible property

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of tangible property to which section 168 applies, the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for any taxable year shall be determined under the alternative depreciation system (within the meaning of section 168(g)(2)).

(B) Treatment of amounts deductible under section 179, 179B, 179C, 179D, or 179E

(i) In general

For purposes of computing the earnings and profits of a corporation, except as provided in clause (ii), any amount deductible under section 179, 179B, 179C, 179D, or 179E shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over the period of 5 taxable years (beginning with the taxable year for which such amount is deductible under section 179, 179B, 179C, 179D, or 179E, as the case may be).

(ii) Special rule

In the case of a corporation that is a real estate investment trust, any amount deductible under section 179D shall be allowed in the year in which the property giving rise to such deduction is placed in service (or, in the case of energy efficient building retrofit property, the year in which the qualifying final certification is made).

(4) Certain foreign corporations

The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply in computing the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year for which less than 20 percent of the gross income from all sources of such corporation is derived from sources within the United States.

(5) Basis adjustment not taken into account

In computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year, the allowance for depreciation (and amortization, if any) shall be computed without regard to any basis adjustment under section 50(c).
