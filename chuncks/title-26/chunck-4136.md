(3) Denial of double benefit

For purposes of chapter 1, the gross income of the employer, for the taxable year which includes the last day of any calendar quarter with respect to which a credit is allowed under this section, shall be increased by the amount of such credit.

This section shall not apply to so much of the qualified family leave wages paid by an eligible employer as such employer elects (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe) to not take into account for purposes of this section.

(B) Application where PPP loans not forgiven

The Secretary shall issue guidance providing that payroll costs paid during the covered period shall not fail to be treated as qualified family leave wages under this section by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) to the extent that

(i) a covered loan of the taxpayer under section 7(a)(37) of the Small Business Act is not forgiven by reason of a decision under section 7(a)(37)(J) of such Act, or

(ii) a covered loan of the taxpayer under section 7A of the Small Business Act is not forgiven by reason of a decision under section 7A(g) of such Act.
