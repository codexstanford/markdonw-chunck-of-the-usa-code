#### § 1291. Interest on tax deferral
##### (c) Deferred tax amount

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

The term “deferred tax amount” means, with respect to any distribution or disposition to which subsection (a) applies, an amount equal to the sum of

(A) the aggregate increases in taxes described in paragraph (2), plus

(B) the aggregate amount of interest (determined in the manner provided under paragraph (3)) on such increases in tax. Any increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for the current year under subsection (a) to the extent attributable to the amount referred to in subparagraph (B) shall be treated as interest paid under section 6601 on the due date for the current year.

(2) Aggregate increases in taxes

For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the aggregate increases in taxes shall be determined by multiplying each amount allocated under subsection (a)(1)(A) to any taxable year (other than any taxable year referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B)) by the highest rate of tax in effect for such taxable year under section 1 or 11, whichever applies.

(3) Computation of interest

(A) In general

The amount of interest referred to in paragraph (1)(B) on any increase determined under paragraph (2) for any taxable year shall be determined for the period

(i) beginning on the due date for such taxable year, and

(ii) ending on the due date for the taxable year with or within which the distribution or disposition occurs, by using the rates and method applicable under section 6621 for underpayments of tax for such period.

(B) Due date

For purposes of this subsection, the term “due date” means the date prescribed by law (determined without regard to extensions) for filing the return of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year.
