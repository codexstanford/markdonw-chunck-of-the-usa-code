##### (c) Shareholder’s return must be consistent with corporate return or Secretary notified of inconsistency

A shareholder of an S corporation shall, on such shareholder’s return, treat a subchapter S item in a manner which is consistent with the treatment of such item on the corporate return.

(2) Notification of inconsistent treatment

(A) In general

In the case of any subchapter S item, if

(II) the corporation has not filed a return, and

(ii) the shareholder files with the Secretary a statement identifying the inconsistency, paragraph (1) shall not apply to such item.

(B) Shareholder receiving incorrect information

A shareholder shall be treated as having complied with clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) with respect to a subchapter S item if the shareholder

(i) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the treatment of the subchapter S item on the shareholder’s return is consistent with the treatment of the item on the schedule furnished to the shareholder by the corporation, and
