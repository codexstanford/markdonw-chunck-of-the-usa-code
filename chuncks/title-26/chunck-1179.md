(2) Amount of reduction

(A) In general

The amount determined under this paragraph with respect to any dollar limitation shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to such limitation as

(i) the excess of

(I) the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over

(II) the applicable dollar amount, bears to

(ii) $10,000 ($20,000 in the case of a joint return).

(B) No reduction below $200 until complete phase-out

No dollar limitation shall be reduced below $200 under paragraph (1) unless (without regard to this subparagraph) such limitation is reduced to zero.

(C) Rounding

Any amount determined under this paragraph which is not a multiple of $10 shall be rounded to the next lowest $10.

(3) Adjusted gross income; applicable dollar amount

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Adjusted gross income

Adjusted gross income of any taxpayer shall be determined

(ii) without regard to sections 85(c), 135, 137, 221, and 911 or the deduction allowable under this section.

(B) Applicable dollar amount

The term “applicable dollar amount” means the following:

(5) Active participant

For purposes of this subsection, the term “active participant” means, with respect to any plan year, an individual

(7) Special rule for spouses who are not active participants

If this subsection applies to an individual for any taxable year solely because their spouse is an active participant, then, in applying this subsection to the individual (but not their spouse)

(B) the amount applicable under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) shall be $10,000.

(8) Inflation adjustment

In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2006, each of the dollar amounts in paragraphs (3)(B)(i), (3)(B)(ii), and (7)(A) shall be increased by an amount equal to

(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting “calendar year 2005” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
