#### § 1286. Tax treatment of stripped bonds
##### (c) Special rules for tax-exempt obligations

(1) In general

In the case of any tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) from which 1 or more coupons have been stripped

(A) the amount of the original issue discount determined under subsection (a) with respect to any stripped bond or stripped coupon

(i) shall be treated as original issue discount on a tax-exempt obligation to the extent such discount does not exceed the tax-exempt portion of such discount, and

(ii) shall be treated as original issue discount on an obligation which is not a tax-exempt obligation to the extent such discount exceeds the tax-exempt portion of such discount,

(B) subsection (b)(1)(A) shall not apply, and

(C) subsection (b)(2) shall be applied by increasing the basis of the bond or coupon by the sum of

(i) the interest accrued but not paid before such bond or coupon was disposed of (and not previously reflected in basis), plus

(ii) the amount included in gross income under subsection (b)(1)(B).

(2) Tax-exempt portion

For purposes of paragraph (1), the tax-exempt portion of the original issue discount determined under subsection (a) is the excess of

(A) the amount referred to in subsection (a)(1), over

(B) an issue price which would produce a yield to maturity as of the purchase date equal to the lower of

(i) the coupon rate of interest on the obligation from which the coupons were separated, or

(ii) the yield to maturity (on the basis of the purchase price) of the stripped obligation or coupon. The purchaser of any stripped obligation or coupon may elect to apply clause (i) by substituting “original yield to maturity of” for “coupon rate of interest on”.
