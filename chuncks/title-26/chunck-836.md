The aggregate amount allocated by the Secretary of Transportation under subparagraph (C) shall not exceed $30,000,000,000.

(B) Enforcement of national limitation

An issue shall not be treated as an issue described in subsection (a)(15) if the aggregate face amount of bonds issued pursuant to such issue for any qualified highway or surface freight transfer facility (when added to the aggregate face amount of bonds previously so issued for such facility) exceeds the amount allocated to such facility under subparagraph (C).
