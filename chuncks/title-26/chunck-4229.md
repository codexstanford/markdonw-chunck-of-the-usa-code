## Subtitle C— Employment Taxes
### CHAPTER 23— FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX ACT
#### § 3306. Definitions
##### (n) Vessels operated by general agents of United States

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c)(6), service performed by officers and members of the crew of a vessel which would otherwise be included as employment under subsection (c) shall not be excluded by reason of the fact that it is performed on or in connection with an American vessel

(1) owned by or bareboat chartered to the United States and

(2) whose business is conducted by a general agent of the Secretary of Transportation. For purposes of this chapter, each such general agent shall be considered a legal entity in his capacity as such general agent, separate and distinct from his identity as a person employing individuals on his own account, and the officers and members of the crew of such an American vessel whose business is conducted by a general agent of the Secretary of Transportation shall be deemed to be performing services for such general agent rather than the United States. Each such general agent who in his capacity as such is an employer within the meaning of subsection (a) shall be subject to all the requirements imposed upon an employer under this chapter with respect to service which constitutes employment by reason of this subsection.
