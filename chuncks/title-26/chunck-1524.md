#### § 382. Limitation on net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses following ownership change
##### (b) Section 382 limitation

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the section 382 limitation for any post-change year is an amount equal to

(A) the value of the old loss corporation, multiplied by

(B) the long-term tax-exempt rate.

(2) Carryforward of unused limitation

If the section 382 limitation for any post-change year exceeds the taxable income of the new loss corporation for such year which was offset by pre-change losses, the section 382 limitation for the next post-change year shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

(3) Special rule for post-change year which includes change date

In the case of any post-change year which includes the change date

(A) Limitation does not apply to taxable income before change

Subsection (a) shall not apply to the portion of the taxable income for such year which is allocable to the period in such year on or before the change date. Except as provided in subsection (h)(5) and in regulations, taxable income shall be allocated ratably to each day in the year.

(B) Limitation for period after change

For purposes of applying the limitation of subsection (a) to the remainder of the taxable income for such year, the section 382 limitation shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to such limitation (determined without regard to this paragraph) as

(i) the number of days in such year after the change date, bears to

(ii) the total number of days in such year.
