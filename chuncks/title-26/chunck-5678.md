(2) Additional information required

(A) In general

The information required under paragraph (1) to be shown on a return with respect to a covered security of a customer shall include the customer’s adjusted basis in such security and whether any gain or loss with respect to such security is long-term or short-term (within the meaning of section 1222).

(B) Determination of adjusted basis

For purposes of subparagraph (A)

(i) In general

The customer’s adjusted basis shall be determined

(I) in the case of any security (other than any stock for which an average basis method is permissible under section 1012), in accordance with the first-in first-out method unless the customer notifies the broker by means of making an adequate identification of the stock sold or transferred, and

(II) in the case of any stock for which an average basis method is permissible under section 1012, in accordance with the broker’s default method unless the customer notifies the broker that he elects another acceptable method under section 1012 with respect to the account in which such stock is held.

(ii) Exception for wash sales

Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, the customer’s adjusted basis shall be determined without regard to section 1091 (relating to loss from wash sales of stock or securities) unless the transactions occur in the same account with respect to identical securities.

(iii) Treatment of uncorrected de minimis errors
