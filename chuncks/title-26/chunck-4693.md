#### § 4942. Taxes on failure to distribute income
##### (h) Treatment of qualifying distributions

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), any qualifying distribution made during a taxable year shall be treated as made

(A) first out of the undistributed income of the immediately preceding taxable year (if the private foundation was subject to the tax imposed by this section for such preceding taxable year) to the extent thereof,

(B) second out of the undistributed income for the taxable year to the extent thereof, and

(C) then out of corpus. For purposes of this paragraph, distributions shall be taken into account in the order of time in which made.

(2) Correction of deficient distributions for prior taxable years, etc.

In the case of any qualifying distribution which (under paragraph (1)) is not treated as made out of the undistributed income of the immediately preceding taxable year, the foundation may elect to treat any portion of such distribution as made out of the undistributed income of a designated prior taxable year or out of corpus. The election shall be made by the foundation at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.
