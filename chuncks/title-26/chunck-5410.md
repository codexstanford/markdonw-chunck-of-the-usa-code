#### § 5733. Provisions relating to liability for occupational taxes
##### (d) Death or change of location

Certain persons, other than the person who has paid the special tax under this subchapter for the carrying on of any business at any place, may secure the right to carry on, without incurring additional special tax, the same business at the same place for the remainder of the taxable period for which the special tax was paid. The persons who may secure such right are:

(1) the surviving spouse or child, or executor or administrator or other legal representative, of a deceased taxpayer;

(2) a husband or wife succeeding to the business of his or her living spouse;

(3) a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or an assignee for benefit of creditors; and

(4) the partner or partners remaining after death or withdrawal of a member of a partnership. When any person moves to any place other than the place for which special tax was paid for the carrying on of any business, he may secure the right to carry on, without incurring additional special tax, the same business at his new location for the remainder of the taxable period for which the special tax was paid. To secure the right to carry on the business without incurring additional special tax, the successor, or the person relocating his business, must register the succession or relocation with the Secretary in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
