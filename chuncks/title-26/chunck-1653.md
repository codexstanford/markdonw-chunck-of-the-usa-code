#### § 409. Qualifications for tax credit employee stock ownership plans
##### (p) Prohibited allocations of securities in an S corporation

(1) In general

An employee stock ownership plan holding employer securities consisting of stock in an S corporation shall provide that no portion of the assets of the plan attributable to (or allocable in lieu of) such employer securities may, during a nonallocation year, accrue (or be allocated directly or indirectly under any plan of the employer meeting the requirements of section 401(a)) for the benefit of any disqualified person.

(2) Failure to meet requirements

(A) In general

If a plan fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1), the plan shall be treated as having distributed to any disqualified person the amount allocated to the account of such person in violation of paragraph (1) at the time of such allocation.

(B) Cross reference

For excise tax relating to violations of paragraph (1) and ownership of synthetic equity, see section 4979A.

(3) Nonallocation year

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “nonallocation year” means any plan year of an employee stock ownership plan if, at any time during such plan year

(i) such plan holds employer securities consisting of stock in an S corporation, and

(ii) disqualified persons own at least 50 percent of the number of shares of stock in the S corporation.

(B) Attribution rules

For purposes of subparagraph (A)

(i) In general

The rules of section 318(a) shall apply for purposes of determining ownership, except that

(I) in applying paragraph (1) thereof, the members of an individual’s family shall include members of the family described in paragraph (4)(D), and

(II) paragraph (4) thereof shall not apply.

(ii) Deemed-owned shares

Notwithstanding the employee trust exception in section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), an individual shall be treated as owning deemed-owned shares of the individual.

Solely for purposes of applying paragraph (5), this subparagraph shall be applied after the attribution rules of paragraph (5) have been applied.

(4) Disqualified person

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “disqualified person” means any person if

(i) the aggregate number of deemed-owned shares of such person and the members of such person’s family is at least 20 percent of the number of deemed-owned shares of stock in the S corporation, or

(ii) in the case of a person not described in clause (i), the number of deemed-owned shares of such person is at least 10 percent of the number of deemed-owned shares of stock in such corporation.

(B) Treatment of family members

In the case of a disqualified person described in subparagraph (A)(i), any member of such person’s family with deemed-owned shares shall be treated as a disqualified person if not otherwise treated as a disqualified person under subparagraph (A).

(C) Deemed-owned shares

(i) In general

The term “deemed-owned shares” means, with respect to any person

(I) the stock in the S corporation constituting employer securities of an employee stock ownership plan which is allocated to such person under the plan, and

(II) such person’s share of the stock in such corporation which is held by such plan but which is not allocated under the plan to participants.

(ii) Person’s share of unallocated stock

For purposes of clause (i)(II), a person’s share of unallocated S corporation stock held by such plan is the amount of the unallocated stock which would be allocated to such person if the unallocated stock were allocated to all participants in the same proportions as the most recent stock allocation under the plan.

(D) Member of family

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “member of the family” means, with respect to any individual

(i) the spouse of the individual,

(ii) an ancestor or lineal descendant of the individual or the individual’s spouse,

(iii) a brother or sister of the individual or the individual’s spouse and any lineal descendant of the brother or sister, and

(iv) the spouse of any individual described in clause (ii) or (iii). A spouse of an individual who is legally separated from such individual under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance shall not be treated as such individual’s spouse for purposes of this subparagraph.

(5) Treatment of synthetic equity

For purposes of paragraphs (3) and (4), in the case of a person who owns synthetic equity in the S corporation, except to the extent provided in regulations, the shares of stock in such corporation on which such synthetic equity is based shall be treated as outstanding stock in such corporation and deemed-owned shares of such person if such treatment of synthetic equity of 1 or more such persons results in

(A) the treatment of any person as a disqualified person, or

(B) the treatment of any year as a nonallocation year. For purposes of this paragraph, synthetic equity shall be treated as owned by a person in the same manner as stock is treated as owned by a person under the rules of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 318(a). If, without regard to this paragraph, a person is treated as a disqualified person or a year is treated as a nonallocation year, this paragraph shall not be construed to result in the person or year not being so treated.
