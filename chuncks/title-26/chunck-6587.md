## Subtitle F— Procedure and Administration
### CHAPTER 68— ADDITIONS TO THE TAX, ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AND ASSESSABLE PENALTIES
#### § 6677. Failure to file information with respect to certain foreign trusts
##### (d) Reasonable cause exception

No penalty shall be imposed by this section on any failure which is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. The fact that a foreign jurisdiction would impose a civil or criminal penalty on the taxpayer (or any other person) for disclosing the required information is not reasonable cause.
