##### (a) State law requirements

For purposes of section 3304(a)(6)

(1) except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), the services to which this paragraph applies are

(A) service excluded from the term “employment” solely by reason of paragraph (8) of section 3306(c), and

(B) service excluded from the term “employment” solely by reason of paragraph (7) of section 3306(c); and

(2) the State law shall provide that a governmental entity, including an Indian tribe, or any other organization (or group of governmental entities or other organizations) which, but for the requirements of this paragraph, would be liable for contributions with respect to service to which paragraph (1) applies may elect, for such minimum period and at such time as may be provided by State law, to pay (in lieu of such contributions) into the State unemployment fund amounts equal to the amounts of compensation attributable under the State law to such service. The State law may provide safeguards to ensure that governmental entities or other organizations so electing will make the payments required under such elections.
