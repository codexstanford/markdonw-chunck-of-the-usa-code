(1) In general

Except as provided in subsection (h), a private activity bond shall not be a qualified bond if issued as part of an issue and any portion of the net proceeds of such issue is to be used for the acquisition of any property (or an interest therein) unless the 1st use of such property is pursuant to such acquisition.

(2) Exception for certain rehabilitations

A rule similar to the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply in the case of structures other than a building except that subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting “100 percent” for “15 percent”.

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

Except as provided in this paragraph, the term “rehabilitation expenditures” means any amount properly chargeable to capital account which is incurred by the person acquiring the building for property (or additions or improvements to property) in connection with the rehabilitation of a building. In the case of an integrated operation contained in a building before its acquisition, such term includes rehabilitating existing equipment in such building or replacing it with equipment having substantially the same function. For purposes of this subparagraph, any amount incurred by a successor to the person acquiring the building or by the seller under a sales contract with such person shall be treated as incurred by such person.

(B) Certain expenditures not included

The term “rehabilitation expenditures” does not include any expenditure described in section 47(c)(2)(B).

The term “rehabilitation expenditures” shall not include any amount which is incurred after the date 2 years after the later of

(i) the date on which the building was acquired, or

(ii) the date on which the bond was issued.

(4) Special rule for certain projects

In the case of a project involving 2 or more buildings, this subsection shall be applied on a project basis.
