### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 217. Moving expenses
##### (d) Rules for application of subsection (c)(2)

(1) The condition of subsection (c)(2) shall not apply if the taxpayer is unable to satisfy such condition by reason of

(A) death or disability, or

(B) involuntary separation (other than for willful misconduct) from the service of, or transfer for the benefit of, an employer after obtaining full-time employment in which the taxpayer could reasonably have been expected to satisfy such condition.

(2) If a taxpayer has not satisfied the condition of subsection (c)(2) before the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year during which he paid or incurred moving expenses which would otherwise be deductible under this section, but may still satisfy such condition, then such expenses may (at the election of the taxpayer) be deducted for such taxable year notwithstanding subsection (c)(2).

(3) If

(A) for any taxable year moving expenses have been deducted in accordance with the rule provided in paragraph (2), and

(B) the condition of subsection (c)(2) cannot be satisfied at the close of a subsequent taxable year, then an amount equal to the expenses which were so deducted shall be included in gross income for the first such subsequent taxable year.
