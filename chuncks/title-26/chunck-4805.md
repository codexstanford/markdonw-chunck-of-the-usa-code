#### § 4973. Tax on excess contributions to certain tax-favored accounts and annuities
##### (f) Excess contributions to Roth IRAs

For purposes of this section, in the case of contributions to a Roth IRA (within the meaning of section 408A(b)), the term “excess contributions” means the sum of

(1) the excess (if any) of

(A) the amount contributed for the taxable year to Roth IRAs (other than a qualified rollover contribution described in section 408A(e)), over

(B) the amount allowable as a contribution under sections 408A(c)(2) and (c)(3), and

(2) the amount determined under this subsection for the preceding taxable year, reduced by the sum of

(A) the distributions out of the accounts for the taxable year, and

(B) the excess (if any) of the maximum amount allowable as a contribution under sections 408A(c)(2) and (c)(3) for the taxable year over the amount contributed by the individual to all individual retirement plans for the taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, any contribution which is distributed from a Roth IRA in a distribution described in section 408(d)(4) shall be treated as an amount not contributed.
