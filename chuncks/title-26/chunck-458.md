(A) In general

If during any taxable year any building to which section 47(d) applied ceases (by reason of sale or other disposition, cancellation or abandonment of contract, or otherwise) to be, with respect to the taxpayer, property which, when placed in service, will be a qualified rehabilitated building, then the tax under this chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed under section 38 for all prior taxable years which would have resulted solely from reducing to zero the credit determined under this subpart with respect to such building.

(B) Certain excess credit recaptured

Any amount which would have been applied as a reduction under paragraph (2) of section 47(b) but for the fact that a reduction under such paragraph cannot reduce the amount taken into account under section 47(b)(1) below zero shall be treated as an amount required to be recaptured under subparagraph (A) for the taxable year during which the building is placed in service.

(C) Certain sales and leasebacks

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a sale by, and leaseback to, a taxpayer who, when the property is placed in service, will be a lessee to whom the rules referred to in subsection (d)(5) apply shall not be treated as a cessation described in subparagraph (A) to the extent that the amount which will be passed through to the lessee under such rules with respect to such property is not less than the qualified rehabilitation expenditures properly taken into account by the lessee under section 47(d) with respect to such property.

(D) Coordination with paragraph (1)

If, after property is placed in service, there is a disposition or other cessation described in paragraph (1), then paragraph (1) shall be applied as if any credit which was allowable by reason of section 47(d) and which has not been required to be recaptured before such disposition, cessation, or change in use were allowable for the taxable year the property was placed in service.

(E) Special rules

Rules similar to the rules of this paragraph shall apply in cases where qualified progress expenditures were taken into account under the rules referred to in section 48(b), 48A(b)(3), 48B(b)(3), 48C(b)(2), or 48D(b)(5).

(A) In general

If there is a an applicable transaction by an applicable taxpayer before the close of the 10-year period beginning on the date such taxpayer placed in service investment credit property which is eligible for the advanced manufacturing investment credit under section 48D(a), then the tax under this chapter for the taxable year in which such transaction occurs shall be increased by 100 percent of the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed under section 38 for all prior taxable years which would have resulted solely from reducing to zero any credit determined under section 46 which is attributable to the advanced manufacturing investment credit under section 48D(a) with respect to such property.

(B) Exception

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the applicable taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the applicable transaction has been ceased or abandoned within 45 days of a determination and notice by the Secretary.

(C) Regulations and guidance

The Secretary shall issue such regulations or other guidance as the Secretary determines necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this paragraph, including regulations or other guidance which provide for requirements for recordkeeping or information reporting for purposes of administering the requirements of this paragraph.

(4) Carrybacks and carryovers adjusted

In the case of any cessation described in paragraph (1) or (2), or any applicable transaction to which paragraph (3)(A) applies, the carrybacks and carryovers under section 39 shall be adjusted by reason of such cessation or applicable transaction.

(5) Subsection not to apply in certain cases

Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to

(A) a transfer by reason of death, or

(B) a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. For purposes of this subsection, property shall not be treated as ceasing to be investment credit property with respect to the taxpayer by reason of a mere change in the form of conducting the trade or business so long as the property is retained in such trade or business as investment credit property and the taxpayer retains a substantial interest in such trade or business.
