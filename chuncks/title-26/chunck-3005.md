#### § 965. Treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to participation exemption system of taxation
##### (c) Application of participation exemption to included income

(1) In general

In the case of a United States shareholder of a deferred foreign income corporation, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year in which an amount is included in the gross income of such United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1) by reason of this section an amount equal to the sum of

(A) the United States shareholder’s 8 percent rate equivalent percentage of the excess (if any) of

(i) the amount so included as gross income, over

(ii) the amount of such United States shareholder’s aggregate foreign cash position, plus

(B) the United States shareholder’s 15.5 percent rate equivalent percentage of so much of the amount described in subparagraph (A)(ii) as does not exceed the amount described in subparagraph (A)(i).

(2) 8 and 15.5 percent rate equivalent percentages

For purposes of this subsection

(A) 8 percent rate equivalent percentage

The term “8 percent rate equivalent percentage” means, with respect to any United States shareholder for any taxable year, the percentage which would result in the amount to which such percentage applies being subject to a 8 percent rate of tax determined by only taking into account a deduction equal to such percentage of such amount and the highest rate of tax specified in section 11 for such taxable year. In the case of any taxable year of a United States shareholder to which section 15 applies, the highest rate of tax under section 11 before the effective date of the change in rates and the highest rate of tax under section 11 after the effective date of such change shall each be taken into account under the preceding sentence in the same proportions as the portion of such taxable year which is before and after such effective date, respectively.

(B) 15.5 percent rate equivalent percentage

The term “15.5 percent rate equivalent percentage” means, with respect to any United States shareholder for any taxable year, the percentage determined under subparagraph (A) applied by substituting “15.5 percent rate of tax” for “8 percent rate of tax”.

(3) Aggregate foreign cash position

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “aggregate foreign cash position” means, with respect to any United States shareholder, the greater of

(i) the aggregate of such United States shareholder’s pro rata share of the cash position of each specified foreign corporation of such United States shareholder determined as of the close of the last taxable year of such specified foreign corporation which begins before January 1, 2018 , or

(ii) one half of the sum of

(I) the aggregate described in clause (i) determined as of the close of the last taxable year of each such specified foreign corporation which ends before November 2, 2017 , plus

(II) the aggregate described in clause (i) determined as of the close of the taxable year of each such specified foreign corporation which precedes the taxable year referred to in subclause (I).

(B) Cash position

For purposes of this paragraph, the cash position of any specified foreign corporation is the sum of

(i) cash held by such foreign corporation,

(ii) the net accounts receivable of such foreign corporation, plus

(iii) the fair market value of the following assets held by such corporation:

(I) Personal property which is of a type that is actively traded and for which there is an established financial market.

(II) Commercial paper, certificates of deposit, the securities of the Federal government and of any State or foreign government.

(III) Any foreign currency.

(IV) Any obligation with a term of less than one year.

(V) Any asset which the Secretary identifies as being economically equivalent to any asset described in this subparagraph.

(C) Net accounts receivable

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “net accounts receivable” means, with respect to any specified foreign corporation, the excess (if any) of

(i) such corporation’s accounts receivable, over

(ii) such corporation’s accounts payable (determined consistent with the rules of section 461).

(D) Prevention of double counting

Cash positions of a specified foreign corporation described in clause (ii), (iii)(I), or (iii)(IV) of subparagraph (B) shall not be taken into account by a United States shareholder under subparagraph (A) to the extent that such United States shareholder demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such amount is so taken into account by such United States shareholder with respect to another specified foreign corporation.

(E) Cash positions of certain non-corporate entities taken into account

An entity (other than a corporation) shall be treated as a specified foreign corporation of a United States shareholder for purposes of determining such United States shareholder’s aggregate foreign cash position if any interest in such entity is held by a specified foreign corporation of such United States shareholder (determined after application of this subparagraph) and such entity would be a specified foreign corporation of such United States shareholder if such entity were a foreign corporation.

(F) Anti-abuse

If the Secretary determines that a principal purpose of any transaction was to reduce the aggregate foreign cash position taken into account under this subsection, such transaction shall be disregarded for purposes of this subsection.
