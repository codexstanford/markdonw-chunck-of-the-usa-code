#### § 1060. Special allocation rules for certain asset acquisitions
##### (c) Applicable asset acquisition

For purposes of this section, the term “applicable asset acquisition” means any transfer (whether directly or indirectly)

(1) of assets which constitute a trade or business, and

(2) with respect to which the transferee’s basis in such assets is determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid for such assets. A transfer shall not be treated as failing to be an applicable asset acquisition merely because section 1031 applies to a portion of the assets transferred.
