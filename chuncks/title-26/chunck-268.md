(A) affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States, or

(B) affects more than 200,000 persons in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug. Determinations under the preceding sentence with respect to any drug shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as of the date such drug is designated under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

(2) Special limitations on foreign testing

No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any clinical testing conducted outside the United States unless

(B) such testing is conducted by a United States person or by any other person who is not related to the taxpayer to whom the designation under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies.

(3) Certain rules made applicable

Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 41(f) shall apply for purposes of this section.

(4) Election

This section shall apply to any taxpayer for any taxable year only if such taxpayer elects (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe) to have this section apply for such taxable year.
