(A) In general

Under regulations, in any case in which a United States person is treated as owning stock in a passive foreign investment company by reason of subsection (a)

(i) any disposition by the United States person or the person owning such stock which results in the United States person being treated as no longer owning such stock, or

(ii) any distribution of property in respect of such stock to the person holding such stock, shall be treated as a disposition by, or distribution to, the United States person with respect to the stock in the passive foreign investment company.

(B) Amount treated in same manner as previously taxed income

Rules similar to the rules of section 959(b) shall apply to any amount described in subparagraph (A) and to any amount included in gross income under section 1293(a) (or which would have been so included but for section 951(c)) in respect of stock which the taxpayer is treated as owning under subsection (a).

(6) Dispositions

Except as provided in regulations, if a taxpayer uses any stock in a passive foreign investment company as security for a loan, the taxpayer shall be treated as having disposed of such stock.

(ii) such foreign corporation owns at least 25 percent (by value) of the stock of a domestic corporation, for purposes of determining whether such foreign corporation is a passive foreign investment company, any qualified stock held by such domestic corporation shall be treated as an asset which does not produce passive income (and is not held for the production of passive income) and any amount included in gross income with respect to such stock shall not be treated as passive income.

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “qualified stock” means any stock in a C corporation which is a domestic corporation and which is not a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust.

(8) Treatment of certain subpart F inclusions
