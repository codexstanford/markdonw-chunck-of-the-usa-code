#### § 4980B. Failure to satisfy continuation coverage requirements of group health plans
##### (g) Definitions

For purposes of this section

(1) Qualified beneficiary

(A) In general

The term “qualified beneficiary” means, with respect to a covered employee under a group health plan, any other individual who, on the day before the qualifying event for that employee, is a beneficiary under the plan

(i) as the spouse of the covered employee, or

(ii) as the dependent child of the employee. Such term shall also include a child who is born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of continuation coverage under this section.

(B) Special rule for terminations and reduced employment

In the case of a qualifying event described in subsection (f)(3)(B), the term “qualified beneficiary” includes the covered employee.

(C) Exception for nonresident aliens

Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the term “qualified beneficiary” does not include an individual whose status as a covered employee is attributable to a period in which such individual was a nonresident alien who received no earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)) from the employer which constituted income from sources within the United States (within the meaning of section 861(a)(3)). If an individual is not a qualified beneficiary pursuant to the previous sentence, a spouse or dependent child of such individual shall not be considered a qualified beneficiary by virtue of the relationship of the individual.

(D) Special rule for retirees and widows

In the case of a qualifying event described in subsection (f)(3)(F), the term “qualified beneficiary” includes a covered employee who had retired on or before the date of substantial elimination of coverage and any other individual who, on the day before such qualifying event, is a beneficiary under the plan

(i) as the spouse of the covered employee,

(ii) as the dependent child of the covered employee, or

(iii) as the surviving spouse of the covered employee.

(2) Group health plan

The term “group health plan” has the meaning given such term by section 5000(b)(1). Such term shall not include any plan substantially all of the coverage under which is for qualified long-term care services (as defined in section 7702B(c)).

(3) Plan administrator

The term “plan administrator” has the meaning given the term “administrator” by section 3(16)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

(4) Correction

A failure of a group health plan to meet the requirements of subsection (f) with respect to any qualified beneficiary shall be treated as corrected if

(A) such failure is retroactively undone to the extent possible, and

(B) the qualified beneficiary is placed in a financial position which is as good as such beneficiary would have been in had such failure not occurred. For purposes of applying subparagraph (B), the qualified beneficiary shall be treated as if he had elected the most favorable coverage in light of the expenses he incurred since the failure first occurred.
