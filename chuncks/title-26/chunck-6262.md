#### § 6405. Reports of refunds and credits
##### (c) Refunds attributable to certain disaster losses

If any refund or credit of income taxes is attributable to the taxpayer’s election under section 165(i) to deduct a disaster loss for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster occurred, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion to make the refund or credit, to the extent attributable to such election, without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. If such refund or credit is made without regard to subsection (a), there shall thereafter be submitted to such Joint Committee a report containing the matter specified in subsection (a) as soon as the Secretary shall determine the correct amount of the tax for the taxable year for which the refund or credit is made.
