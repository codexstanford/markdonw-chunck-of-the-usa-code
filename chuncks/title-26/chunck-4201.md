#### § 3303. Conditions of additional credit allowance
##### (f) Prohibition on noncharging due to employer fault

(1) In general

A State law shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(1) only if such law provides that an employer’s account shall not be relieved of charges relating to a payment from the State unemployment fund if the State agency determines that

(A) the payment was made because the employer, or an agent of the employer, was at fault for failing to respond timely or adequately to the request of the agency for information relating to the claim for compensation; and

(B) the employer or agent has established a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately to such requests.

(2) State authority to impose stricter standards

Nothing in paragraph (1) shall limit the authority of a State to provide that an employer’s account not be relieved of charges relating to a payment from the State unemployment fund for reasons other than the reasons described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph, such as after the first instance of a failure to respond timely or adequately to requests described in paragraph (1)(A).
