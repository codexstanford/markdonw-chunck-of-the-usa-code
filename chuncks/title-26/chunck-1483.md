### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 356. Receipt of additional consideration
##### (b) Additional consideration received in certain distributions

If

(1) section 355 would apply to a distribution but for the fact that

(2) the property received in the distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 355 to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then an amount equal to the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.
