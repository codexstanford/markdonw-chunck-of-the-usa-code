#### § 169. Amortization of pollution control facilities
##### (f) Amortizable basis

(1) Defined

For purposes of this section, the term “amortizable basis” means that portion of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) of a certified pollution control facility which may be amortized under this section.

(2) Special rules

(A) If a certified pollution control facility has a useful life (determined as of the first day of the first month for which a deduction is allowable under this section) in excess of 15 years, the amortizable basis of such facility shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to the portion of the adjusted basis of such facility, which would be eligible for amortization but for the application of this subparagraph, as 15 bears to the number of years of useful life of such facility.

(B) The amortizable basis of a certified pollution control facility with respect to which an election under this section is in effect shall not be increased, for purposes of this section, for additions or improvements after the amortization period has begun.
