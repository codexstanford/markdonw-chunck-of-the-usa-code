(II) solid wood waste materials, including waste pallets, crates, dunnage, manufacturing and construction wood wastes (other than pressure-treated, chemically-treated, or painted wood wastes), and landscape or right-of-way tree trimmings, but not including municipal solid waste, gas derived from the biodegradation of solid waste, or paper which is commonly recycled, or

(III) agriculture sources, including orchard tree crops, vineyard, grain, legumes, sugar, and other crop by-products or residues. Such term shall not include closed-loop biomass or biomass burned in conjunction with fossil fuel (cofiring) beyond such fossil fuel required for startup and flame stabilization.

(B) Agricultural livestock waste nutrients

(i) In general

The term “agricultural livestock waste nutrients” means agricultural livestock manure and litter, including wood shavings, straw, rice hulls, and other bedding material for the disposition of manure.

(ii) Agricultural livestock

The term “agricultural livestock” includes bovine, swine, poultry, and sheep.

(4) Geothermal energy

The term “geothermal energy” means energy derived from a geothermal deposit (within the meaning of section 613(e)(2)).

(5) Small irrigation power

The term “small irrigation power” means power

(A) generated without any dam or impoundment of water through an irrigation system canal or ditch, and

(B) the nameplate capacity rating of which is not less than 150 kilowatts but is less than 5 megawatts.

(6) Municipal solid waste

The term “municipal solid waste” has the meaning given the term “solid waste” under section 1004(27) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act ( 42 U.S.C. 6903 ), except that such term does not include paper which is commonly recycled and which has been segregated from other solid waste (as so defined).

(7) Refined coal

(A) In general

The term “refined coal” means a fuel

(i) which

(I) is a liquid, gaseous, or solid fuel produced from coal (including lignite) or high carbon fly ash, including such fuel used as a feedstock,

(II) is sold by the taxpayer with the reasonable expectation that it will be used for the purpose of producing steam, and

(III) is certified by the taxpayer as resulting (when used in the production of steam) in a qualified emission reduction, or

(ii) which is steel industry fuel.

(B) Qualified emission reduction

The term “qualified emission reduction” means a reduction of at least 20 percent of the emissions of nitrogen oxide and at least 40 percent of the emissions of either sulfur dioxide or mercury released when burning the refined coal (excluding any dilution caused by materials combined or added during the production process), as compared to the emissions released when burning the feedstock coal or comparable coal predominantly available in the marketplace as of January 1, 2003 .

(C) Steel industry fuel

(i) In general

The term “steel industry fuel” means a fuel which

(I) is produced through a process of liquifying coal waste sludge and distributing it on coal, and

(II) is used as a feedstock for the manufacture of coke.

(ii) Coal waste sludge

The term “coal waste sludge” means the tar decanter sludge and related byproducts of the coking process, including such materials that have been stored in ground, in tanks and in lagoons, that have been treated as hazardous wastes under applicable Federal environmental rules absent liquefaction and processing with coal into a feedstock for the manufacture of coke.

(8) Qualified hydropower production

(A) In general

The term “qualified hydropower production” means

(i) in the case of any hydroelectric dam which was placed in service on or before the date of the enactment of this paragraph, the incremental hydropower production for the taxable year, and

(ii) in the case of any nonhydroelectric dam described in subparagraph (C), the hydropower production from the facility for the taxable year.

(B) Determination of incremental hydropower production

(i) In general

For purposes of subparagraph (A), incremental hydropower production for any taxable year shall be equal to the percentage of average annual hydropower production at the facility attributable to the efficiency improvements or additions of capacity placed in service after the date of the enactment of this paragraph, determined by using the same water flow information used to determine an historic average annual hydropower production baseline for such facility. Such percentage and baseline shall be certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

(ii) Operational changes disregarded

For purposes of clause (i), the determination of incremental hydropower production shall not be based on any operational changes at such facility not directly associated with the efficiency improvements or additions of capacity.

(C) Nonhydroelectric dam

For purposes of subparagraph (A), a facility is described in this subparagraph if

(i) the hydroelectric project installed on the nonhydroelectric dam is licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and meets all other applicable environmental, licensing, and regulatory requirements,

(ii) the nonhydroelectric dam was placed in service before the date of the enactment of this paragraph and operated for flood control, navigation, or water supply purposes and did not produce hydroelectric power on the date of the enactment of this paragraph, and

(iii) the hydroelectric project is operated so that the water surface elevation at any given location and time that would have occurred in the absence of the hydroelectric project is maintained, subject to any license requirements imposed under applicable law that change the water surface elevation for the purpose of improving environmental quality of the affected waterway. The Secretary, in consultation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall certify if a hydroelectric project licensed at a nonhydroelectric dam meets the criteria in clause (iii). Nothing in this section shall affect the standards under which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues licenses for and regulates hydropower projects under part I of the Federal Power Act.

(9) Indian coal

(A) In general

The term “Indian coal” means coal which is produced from coal reserves which, on June 14, 2005

(i) were owned by an Indian tribe, or

(ii) were held in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or its members.

(B) Indian tribe

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “Indian tribe” has the meaning given such term by section 7871(c)(3)(E)(ii).

(10) Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy

(ii) free flowing water in rivers, lakes, and streams,

(iii) free flowing water in an irrigation system, canal, or other man-made channel, including projects that utilize nonmechanical structures to accelerate the flow of water for electric power production purposes,

(iv) differentials in ocean temperature (ocean thermal energy conversion), or

(v) pressurized water used in a pipeline (or similar man-made water conveyance) which is operated

(I) for the distribution of water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption, and

(II) not primarily for the generation of electricity.

(B) Exceptions

Such term shall not include any energy which is derived from any source which utilizes a dam, diversionary structure (except as provided in subparagraph (A)(iii)), or impoundment for electric power production purposes.
