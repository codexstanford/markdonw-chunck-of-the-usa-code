In the case of a real estate investment trust, in determining the amount of dividends under section 316 for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction

(A) the earnings and profits of such trust for any taxable year (but not its accumulated earnings) shall be increased by the amount of gain (if any) on the sale or exchange of real property which is taken into account in determining the taxable income of such trust for such taxable year (and not otherwise taken into account in determining such earnings and profits), and

(B) section 857(d)(1) shall be applied without regard to subparagraph (B) thereof.

(2) Authority to provide alternative remedies for certain failures

In the case of a failure of a distribution by a real estate investment trust to comply with the requirements of subsection (c), the Secretary may provide an appropriate remedy to cure such failure in lieu of not considering the distribution to be a dividend for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction if

(A) the Secretary determines that such failure is inadvertent or is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, or

(B) such failure is of a type of failure which the Secretary has identified for purposes of this paragraph as being described in subparagraph (A).
