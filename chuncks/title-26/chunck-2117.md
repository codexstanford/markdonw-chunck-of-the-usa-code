#### § 512. Unrelated business taxable income
##### (d) Treatment of dues of agricultural or horticultural organizations

(1) In general

If

(A) an agricultural or horticultural organization described in section 501(c)(5) requires annual dues to be paid in order to be a member of such organization, and

(B) the amount of such required annual dues does not exceed $100, in no event shall any portion of such dues be treated as derived by such organization from an unrelated trade or business by reason of any benefits or privileges to which members of such organization are entitled.

(2) Indexation of $100 amount

In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 1995, the $100 amount in paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to

(A) $100, multiplied by

(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, by substituting “calendar year 1994” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.

(3) Dues

For purposes of this subsection, the term “dues” means any payment (whether or not designated as dues) which is required to be made in order to be recognized by the organization as a member of the organization.
