#### § 45X. Advanced manufacturing production credit
##### (b) Credit amount

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (3), the amount determined under this subsection with respect to any eligible component, including any eligible component it incorporates, shall be equal to

(A) in the case of a thin film photovoltaic cell or a crystalline photovoltaic cell, an amount equal to the product of

(i) 4 cents, multiplied by

(ii) the capacity of such cell (expressed on a per direct current watt basis),

(B) in the case of a photovoltaic wafer, $12 per square meter,

(C) in the case of solar grade polysilicon, $3 per kilogram,

(D) in the case of a polymeric backsheet, 40 cents per square meter,

(E) in the case of a solar module, an amount equal to the product of

(i) 7 cents, multiplied by

(ii) the capacity of such module (expressed on a per direct current watt basis),

(F) in the case of a wind energy component

(i) if such component is a related offshore wind vessel, an amount equal to 10 percent of the sales price of such vessel, and

(ii) if such component is not described in clause (i), an amount equal to the product of

(I) the applicable amount with respect to such component (as determined under paragraph (2)(A)), multiplied by

(II) the total rated capacity (expressed on a per watt basis) of the completed wind turbine for which such component is designed,

(G) in the case of a torque tube, 87 cents per kilogram,

(H) in the case of a structural fastener, $2.28 per kilogram,

(I) in the case of an inverter, an amount equal to the product of

(i) the applicable amount with respect to such inverter (as determined under paragraph (2)(B)), multiplied by

(ii) the capacity of such inverter (expressed on a per alternating current watt basis),

(J) in the case of electrode active materials, an amount equal to 10 percent of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production of such materials,

(K) in the case of a battery cell, an amount equal to the product of

(i) $35, multiplied by

(ii) subject to paragraph (4), the capacity of such battery cell (expressed on a kilowatt-hour basis),

(L) in the case of a battery module, an amount equal to the product of

(i) $10 (or, in the case of a battery module which does not use battery cells, $45), multiplied by

(ii) subject to paragraph (4), the capacity of such battery module (expressed on a kilowatt-hour basis), and

(M) in the case of any applicable critical mineral, an amount equal to 10 percent of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production of such mineral.

(2) Applicable amounts

(A) Wind energy components

For purposes of paragraph (1)(F)(ii), the applicable amount with respect to any wind energy component shall be

(i) in the case of a blade, 2 cents,

(ii) in the case of a nacelle, 5 cents,

(iii) in the case of a tower, 3 cents, and

(iv) in the case of an offshore wind foundation

(I) which uses a fixed platform, 2 cents, or

(II) which uses a floating platform, 4 cents.

(B) Inverters

For purposes of paragraph (1)(I), the applicable amount with respect to any inverter shall be

(i) in the case of a central inverter, 0.25 cents,

(ii) in the case of a utility inverter, 1.5 cents,

(iii) in the case of a commercial inverter, 2 cents,

(iv) in the case of a residential inverter, 6.5 cents, and

(v) in the case of a microinverter or a distributed wind inverter, 11 cents.

(3) Phase out

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (C), in the case of any eligible component sold after December 31, 2029 , the amount determined under this subsection with respect to such component shall be equal to the product of

(i) the amount determined under paragraph (1) with respect to such component, as determined without regard to this paragraph, multiplied by

(ii) the phase out percentage under subparagraph (B).

(B) Phase out percentage

The phase out percentage under this subparagraph is equal to

(i) in the case of an eligible component sold during calendar year 2030, 75 percent,

(ii) in the case of an eligible component sold during calendar year 2031, 50 percent,

(iii) in the case of an eligible component sold during calendar year 2032, 25 percent,

(iv) in the case of an eligible component sold after December 31, 2032 , 0 percent.

(C) Exception

For purposes of determining the amount under this subsection with respect to any applicable critical mineral, this paragraph shall not apply.

(4) Limitation on capacity of battery cells and battery modules

(A) In general

For purposes of subparagraph (K)(ii) or (L)(ii) of paragraph (1), the capacity determined under either subparagraph with respect to a battery cell or battery module shall not exceed a capacity-to-power ratio of 100:1.

(B) Capacity-to-power ratio

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “capacity-to-power ratio” means, with respect to a battery cell or battery module, the ratio of the capacity of such cell or module to the maximum discharge amount of such cell or module.
