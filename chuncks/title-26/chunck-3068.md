#### § 995. Taxation of DISC income to shareholders
##### (f) Interest on DISC-related deferred tax liability

(1) In general

A shareholder of a DISC shall pay for each taxable year interest in an amount equal to the product of

(A) the shareholder’s DISC-related deferred tax liability for such year, and

(B) the base period T-bill rate.

(2) Shareholder’s DISC-related deferred tax liability

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “shareholder’s DISC-related deferred tax liability” means, with respect to any taxable year of a shareholder of a DISC, the excess of

(i) the amount which would be the tax liability of the shareholder for the taxable year if the deferred DISC income of such shareholder for such taxable year were included in gross income as ordinary income, over

(ii) the actual amount of the tax liability of such shareholder for such taxable year. Determinations under the preceding sentence shall be made without regard to carrybacks to such taxable year.

(B) Adjustments for losses, credits, and other items

The Secretary shall prescribe regulations which provide such adjustments

(i) to the accounts of the DISC, and

(ii) to the amount of any carryover or carryback of the shareholder, as may be necessary or appropriate in the case of net operating losses, credits, and carryovers, and carrybacks of losses and credits.

(C) Tax liability

The term “tax liability” means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year reduced by credits allowable against such tax (other than credits allowable under sections 31, 32, and 34).

(3) Deferred DISC income

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “deferred DISC income” means, with respect to any taxable year of a shareholder, the excess of

(i) the shareholder’s pro rata share of accumulated DISC income (for periods after 1984) of the DISC as of the close of the computation year, over

(ii) the amount of the distributions-in-excess-of-income for the taxable year of the DISC following the computation year.

(B) Computation year

For purposes of applying subparagraph (A) with respect to any taxable year of a shareholder, the computation year is the taxable year of the DISC which ends with (or within) the taxable year of the shareholder which precedes the taxable year of the shareholder for which the amount of deferred DISC income is being determined.

(C) Distributions-in-excess-of-income

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “distributions-in-excess-of-income” means, with respect to any taxable year of a DISC, the excess (if any) of

(i) the amount of actual distributions to the shareholder out of accumulated DISC income, over

(ii) the shareholder’s pro rata share of the DISC income for such taxable year.

(4) Base period T-bill rate

For purposes of this subsection, the term “base period T-bill rate” means the annual rate of interest determined by the Secretary to be equivalent to the average of the 1-year constant maturity Treasury yields, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the calendar year ending with (or of the most recent calendar year ending before) the close of the taxable year of the shareholder.

(5) Short years

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the application of this subsection to short years of the DISC, the shareholder, or both.

(6) Payment and assessment and collection of interest

The interest accrued during any taxable year which a shareholder is required to pay under paragraph (1) shall be treated, for purposes of this title, as interest payable under section 6601 and shall be paid by the shareholder at the time the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year is required to be paid.

(7) DISC includes former DISC

For purposes of this subsection, the term “DISC” includes a former DISC.
