#### § 1286. Tax treatment of stripped bonds
##### (a) Inclusion in income as if bond and coupons were original issue discount bonds

If any person purchases a stripped bond or a stripped coupon, then such bond or coupon while held by such purchaser (or by any other person whose basis is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of such purchaser) shall be treated for purposes of this part as a bond originally issued on the purchase date and having an original issue discount equal to the excess (if any) of

(1) the stated redemption price at maturity (or, in the case of coupon, the amount payable on the due date of such coupon), over

(2) such bond’s or coupon’s ratable share of the purchase price. For purposes of paragraph (2), ratable shares shall be determined on the basis of their respective fair market values on the date of purchase.
