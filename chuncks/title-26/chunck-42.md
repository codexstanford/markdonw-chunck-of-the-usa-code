##### (h) Application of credit in possessions

(1) Payment to possessions with mirror code tax systems

The Secretary shall pay to each possession of the United States with a mirror code tax system amounts equal to the loss (if any) to that possession by reason of the application of this section (determined without regard to this subsection) with respect to taxable years beginning in or with 2021. Such amounts shall be determined by the Secretary based on information provided by the government of the respective possession.

(2) Payments to other possessions

The Secretary shall pay to each possession of the United States which does not have a mirror code tax system amounts estimated by the Secretary as being equal to the aggregate benefits that would have been provided to residents of such possession by reason of this section with respect to taxable years beginning in or with 2021 if a mirror code tax system had been in effect in such possession. The preceding sentence shall not apply unless the respective possession has a plan, which has been approved by the Secretary, under which such possession will promptly distribute such payments to its residents.

(3) Coordination with credit allowed against United States income taxes

In the case of any taxable year beginning in or with 2021, no credit shall be allowed under this section to any individual

(A) to whom a credit is allowable against taxes imposed by a possession with a mirror code tax system by reason of this section, or

(B) who is eligible for a payment under a plan described in paragraph (2).

(4) Mirror code tax system

For purposes of this subsection, the term “mirror code tax system” means, with respect to any possession of the United States, the income tax system of such possession if the income tax liability of the residents of such possession under such system is determined by reference to the income tax laws of the United States as if such possession were the United States.

(5) Treatment of payments

For purposes of section 1324 of title 31 , United States Code, the payments under this subsection shall be treated in the same manner as a refund due from a credit provision referred to in subsection (b)(2) of such section.
