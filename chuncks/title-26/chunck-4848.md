#### § 4980. Tax on reversion of qualified plan assets to employer
##### (c) Definitions and special rules

For purposes of this section

(1) Qualified plan

The term “qualified plan” means any plan meeting the requirements of section 401(a) or 403(a), other than

(A) a plan maintained by an employer if such employer has, at all times, been exempt from tax under subtitle A, or

(B) a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)). Such term shall include any plan which, at any time, has been determined by the Secretary to be a qualified plan.

(2) Employer reversion

(A) In general

The term “employer reversion” means the amount of cash and the fair market value of other property received (directly or indirectly) by an employer from the qualified plan.

(B) Exceptions

The term “employer reversion” shall not include

(i) except as provided in regulations, any amount distributed to or on behalf of any employee (or his beneficiaries) if such amount could have been so distributed before termination of such plan without violating any provision of section 401,

(ii) any distribution to the employer which is allowable under section 401(a)(2)

(I) in the case of a multiemployer plan, by reason of mistakes of law or fact or the return of any withdrawal liability payment,

(II) in the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, by reason of mistake of fact, or

(III) in the case of any plan, by reason of the failure of the plan to initially qualify or the failure of contributions to be deductible, or

(iii) any transfer described in section 420(f)(2)(B)(ii)(II).

(3) Exception for employee stock ownership plans

(A) In general

If, upon an employer reversion from a qualified plan, any applicable amount is transferred from such plan to an employee stock ownership plan described in section 4975(e)(7) or a tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as described in section 409), such amount shall not be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of this section (or includible in the gross income of the employer) if the requirements of subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) are met.

(B) Investment in employer securities

The requirements of this subparagraph are met if, within 90 days after the transfer (or such longer period as the Secretary may prescribe), the amount transferred is invested in employer securities (as defined in section 409( l )) or used to repay loans used to purchase such securities.

(C) Allocation requirements

The requirements of this subparagraph are met if the portion of the amount transferred which is not allocated under the plan to accounts of participants in the plan year in which the transfer occurs

(i) is credited to a suspense account and allocated from such account to accounts of participants no less rapidly than ratably over a period not to exceed 7 years, and

(ii) when allocated to accounts of participants under the plan, is treated as an employer contribution for purposes of section 415(c), except that

(I) the annual addition (as determined under section 415(c)) attributable to each such allocation shall not exceed the value of such securities as of the time such securities were credited to such suspense account, and

(II) no additional employer contributions shall be permitted to an employee stock ownership plan described in subparagraph (A) of the employer before the allocation of such amount. The amount allocated in the year of transfer shall not be less than the lesser of the maximum amount allowable under section 415 or ⅛ of the amount attributable to the securities acquired. In the case of dividends on securities held in the suspense account, the requirements of this subparagraph are met only if the dividends are allocated to accounts of participants or paid to participants in proportion to their accounts, or used to repay loans used to purchase employer securities.

(D) Participants

The requirements of this subparagraph are met if at least half of the participants in the qualified plan are participants in the employee stock ownership plan (as of the close of the 1st plan year for which an allocation of the securities is required).

(E) Applicable amount

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “applicable amount” means any amount which

(i) is transferred after March 31, 1985 , and before January 1, 1989 , or

(ii) is transferred after December 31, 1988 , pursuant to a termination which occurs after March 31, 1985 , and before January 1, 1989 .

(F) No credit or deduction allowed

No credit or deduction shall be allowed under chapter 1 for any amount transferred to an employee stock ownership plan in a transfer to which this paragraph applies.

(G) Amount transferred to include income thereon, etc.

The amount transferred shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) unless amounts attributable to such amount also meet such requirements.

(4) Time for payment of tax

For purposes of subtitle F, the time for payment of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be the last day of the month following the month in which the employer reversion occurs.
