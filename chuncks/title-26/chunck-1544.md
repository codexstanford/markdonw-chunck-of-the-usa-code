##### (c) Definitions

For purposes of this section

(1) Recognized built-in gain

(A) In general

The term “recognized built-in gain” means any gain recognized during the recognition period on the disposition of any asset except to the extent the gain corporation (or, in any case described in subsection (a)(1)(B), the acquiring corporation) establishes that

(i) such asset was not held by the gain corporation on the acquisition date, or

(ii) such gain exceeds the excess (if any) of

(I) the fair market value of such asset on the acquisition date, over

(II) the adjusted basis of such asset on such date.

(B) Treatment of certain income items

Any item of income which is properly taken into account for any recognition period taxable year but which is attributable to periods before the acquisition date shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain for the taxable year in which it is properly taken into account and shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the net unrealized built-in gain.

(C) Limitation

The amount of the recognized built-in gains for any recognition period taxable year shall not exceed

(i) the net unrealized built-in gain, reduced by

(ii) the recognized built-in gains for prior years ending in the recognition period which (but for this section) would have been offset by preacquisition losses.

(2) Acquisition date

The term “acquisition date” means

(A) in any case described in subsection (a)(1)(A), the date on which the acquisition of control occurs, or

(B) in any case described in subsection (a)(1)(B), the date of the transfer in the reorganization.

(3) Preacquisition loss

(A) In general

The term “preacquisition loss” means

(i) any net operating loss carryforward to the taxable year in which the acquisition date occurs, and

(ii) any net operating loss for the taxable year in which the acquisition date occurs to the extent such loss is allocable to the period in such year on or before the acquisition date. Except as provided in regulations, the net operating loss shall, for purposes of clause (ii), be allocated ratably to each day in the year.

(B) Treatment of recognized built-in loss

In the case of a corporation with a net unrealized built-in loss, the term “preacquisition loss” includes any recognized built-in loss.

(4) Gain corporation

The term “gain corporation” means any corporation with a net unrealized built-in gain.

(5) Control

The term “control” means ownership of stock in a corporation which meets the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).

(6) Treatment of members of same group

Except as provided in regulations and except for purposes of subsection (b), all corporations which are members of the same affiliated group immediately before the acquisition date shall be treated as 1 corporation. To the extent provided in regulations, section 1504 shall be applied without regard to subsection (b) thereof for purposes of the preceding sentence.

(7) Treatment of predecessors and successors

Any reference in this section to a corporation shall include a reference to any predecessor or successor thereof.

(8) Other definitions

Except as provided in regulations, the terms “net unrealized built-in gain”, “net unrealized built-in loss”, “recognized built-in loss”, “recognition period”, and “recognition period taxable year”, have the same respective meanings as when used in section 382(h), except that the acquisition date shall be taken into account in lieu of the change date.
