## Subtitle B— Estate and Gift Taxes
### CHAPTER 13— TAX ON GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFERS
#### § 2651. Generation assignment
##### (e) Special rule for persons with a deceased parent

(1) In general

For purposes of determining whether any transfer is a generation-skipping transfer, if

(A) an individual is a descendant of a parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse), and

(B) such individual’s parent who is a lineal descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) is dead at the time the transfer (from which an interest of such individual is established or derived) is subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 upon the transferor (and if there shall be more than 1 such time, then at the earliest such time), such individual shall be treated as if such individual were a member of the generation which is 1 generation below the lower of the transferor’s generation or the generation assignment of the youngest living ancestor of such individual who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse), and the generation assignment of any descendant of such individual shall be adjusted accordingly.

(2) Limited application of subsection to collateral heirs

This subsection shall not apply with respect to a transfer to any individual who is not a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) if, at the time of the transfer, such transferor has any living lineal descendant.
