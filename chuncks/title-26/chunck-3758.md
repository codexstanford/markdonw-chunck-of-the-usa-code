#### § 1503. Computation and payment of tax
##### (e) Special rule for determining adjustments to basis

(1) In general

Solely for purposes of determining gain or loss on the disposition of intragroup stock and the amount of any inclusion by reason of an excess loss account, in determining the adjustments to the basis of such intragroup stock on account of the earnings and profits of any member of an affiliated group for any consolidated year (and in determining the amount in such account)

(A) such earnings and profits shall be determined as if section 312 were applied for such taxable year (and all preceding consolidated years of the member with respect to such group) without regard to subsections (k) and (n) thereof, and

(B) earnings and profits shall not include any amount excluded from gross income under section 108 to the extent the amount so excluded was not applied to reduce tax attributes (other than basis in property).

(2) Definitions

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Intragroup stock

The term “intragroup stock” means any stock which

(i) is in a corporation which is or was a member of an affiliated group of corporations, and

(ii) is held by another corporation which is or was a member of such group. Such term includes any other property the basis of which is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of stock described in the preceding sentence.

(B) Consolidated year

The term “consolidated year” means any taxable year for which the affiliated group makes a consolidated return.

(C) Application of section 312(n)(7) not affected

The reference in paragraph (1) to subsection (n) of section 312 shall be treated as not including a reference to paragraph (7) of such subsection.

(3) Adjustments

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, proper adjustments shall be made in the application of paragraph (1)

(A) in the case of any property acquired by the corporation before consolidation, for the difference between the adjusted basis of such property for purposes of computing taxable income and its adjusted basis for purposes of computing earnings and profits, and

(B) in the case of any property, for any basis adjustment under section 50(c).

(4) Elimination of election to reduce basis of indebtedness

Nothing in the regulations prescribed under section 1502 shall permit any reduction in the amount otherwise included in gross income by reason of an excess loss account if such reduction is on account of a reduction in the basis of indebtedness.
