##### (f) Income requirements

(1) In general

An issue meets the requirements of this subsection only if all owner-financing provided under the issue is provided for mortgagors whose family income is 115 percent or less of the applicable median family income.

(2) Determination of family income

For purposes of this subsection, the family income of mortgagors, and area median gross income, shall be determined by the Secretary after taking into account the regulations prescribed under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (or, if such program is terminated, under such program as in effect immediately before such termination).

(3) Special rule for applying paragraph (1) in the case of targeted area residences

In the case of any financing provided under any issue for targeted area residences

(A) ⅓ of the amount of such financing may be provided without regard to paragraph (1), and

(B) paragraph (1) shall be treated as satisfied with respect to the remainder of the owner financing if the family income of the mortgagor is 140 percent or less of the applicable median family income.

(4) Applicable median family income

For purposes of this subsection, the term “applicable median family income” means, with respect to a residence, whichever of the following is the greater:

(A) the area median gross income for the area in which such residence is located, or

(B) the statewide median gross income for the State in which such residence is located.

(5) Adjustment of income requirement based on relation of high housing costs to income

(A) In general

If the residence (for which financing is provided under the issue) is located in a high housing cost area and the limitation determined under this paragraph is greater than the limitation otherwise applicable under paragraph (1), there shall be substituted for the income limitation in paragraph (1), a limitation equal to the percentage determined under subparagraph (B) of the area median gross income for such area.

(B) Income requirements for residences in high housing cost area

The percentage determined under this subparagraph for a residence located in a high housing cost area is the percentage (not greater than 140 percent) equal to the product of

(I) 115 percent, and

(II) the amount by which the housing cost/income ratio for such area exceeds 0.2.

(C) High housing cost areas

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “high housing cost area” means any statistical area for which the housing cost/income ratio is greater than 1.2.

(D) Housing cost/income ratio

For purposes of this paragraph

(i) In general

The term “housing cost/income ratio” means, with respect to any statistical area, the number determined by dividing

(I) the applicable housing price ratio for such area, by

(II) the ratio which the area median gross income for such area bears to the median gross income for the United States.

(ii) Applicable housing price ratio

For purposes of clause (i), the applicable housing price ratio for any area is the new housing price ratio or the existing housing price ratio, whichever results in the housing cost/income ratio being closer to 1.

(iii) New housing price ratio

The new housing price ratio for any area is the ratio which

(I) the average area purchase price (as defined in subsection (e)(2)) for residences described in subsection (e)(3)(A) which are located in such area bears to

(II) the average purchase price (determined in accordance with the principles of subsection (e)(2)) for residences so described which are located in the United States.

(iv) Existing housing price ratio

The existing housing price ratio for any area is the ratio determined in accordance with clause (iii) but with respect to residences described in subsection (e)(3)(B).

(6) Adjustment to income requirements based on family size

In the case of a mortgagor having a family of fewer than 3 individuals, the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be applied by substituting

(A) “100 percent” for “115 percent” each place it appears, and

(B) “120 percent” for “140 percent” each place it appears.
