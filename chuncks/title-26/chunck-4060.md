### CHAPTER 14— SPECIAL VALUATION RULES
#### § 2704. Treatment of certain lapsing rights and restrictions
##### (b) Certain restrictions on liquidation disregarded

(1) In general

For purposes of this subtitle, if

(A) there is a transfer of an interest in a corporation or partnership to (or for the benefit of) a member of the transferor’s family, and

(B) the transferor and members of the transferor’s family hold, immediately before the transfer, control of the entity, any applicable restriction shall be disregarded in determining the value of the transferred interest.

(2) Applicable restriction

For purposes of this subsection, the term “applicable restriction” means any restriction

(A) which effectively limits the ability of the corporation or partnership to liquidate, and

(B) with respect to which either of the following applies:

(i) The restriction lapses, in whole or in part, after the transfer referred to in paragraph (1).

(ii) The transferor or any member of the transferor’s family, either alone or collectively, has the right after such transfer to remove, in whole or in part, the restriction.

(3) Exceptions

The term “applicable restriction” shall not include

(A) any commercially reasonable restriction which arises as part of any financing by the corporation or partnership with a person who is not related to the transferor or transferee, or a member of the family of either, or

(B) any restriction imposed, or required to be imposed, by any Federal or State law.

(4) Other restrictions

The Secretary may by regulations provide that other restrictions shall be disregarded in determining the value of the transfer of any interest in a corporation or partnership to a member of the transferor’s family if such restriction has the effect of reducing the value of the transferred interest for purposes of this subtitle but does not ultimately reduce the value of such interest to the transferee.
