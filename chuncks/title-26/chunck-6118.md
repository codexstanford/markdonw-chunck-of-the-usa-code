#### § 6311. Payment of tax by commercially acceptable means
##### (d) Payment by other means

(1) Authority to prescribe regulations

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary deems necessary to receive payment by commercially acceptable means, including regulations that

(A) specify which methods of payment by commercially acceptable means will be acceptable,

(B) specify when payment by such means will be considered received,

(C) identify types of nontax matters related to payment by such means that are to be resolved by persons ultimately liable for payment and financial intermediaries, without the involvement of the Secretary, and

(D) ensure that tax matters will be resolved by the Secretary, without the involvement of financial intermediaries.

(2) Authority to enter into contracts

Notwithstanding section 3718(f) of title 31 , United States Code, the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts to obtain services related to receiving payment by other means where cost beneficial to the Government. The Secretary may not pay any fee or provide any other consideration under any such contract for the use of credit, debit, or charge cards for the payment of taxes imposed by subtitle A. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the Secretary ensures that any such fee or other consideration is fully recouped by the Secretary in the form of fees paid to the Secretary by persons paying taxes imposed under subtitle A with credit, debit, or charge cards pursuant to such contract. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall seek to minimize the amount of any fee or other consideration that the Secretary pays under any such contract.

(B) a payment of internal revenue taxes (or a payment for internal revenue stamps) shall not be subject to section 170 of the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1666i ), or to any similar provisions of State law,

(D) the term “creditor” under section 103(g) of the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1602(g) ) shall not include the Secretary with respect to credit card transactions in payment of internal revenue taxes (or payment for internal revenue stamps), and

(E) notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in the case of payment made by credit card or debit card transaction of an amount owed to a person as the result of the correction of an error under section 161 of the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1666 ) or section 908 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1693f ), the Secretary is authorized to provide such amount to such person as a credit to that person’s credit card or debit card account through the applicable credit card or debit card system.
