### CHAPTER 63— ASSESSMENT
#### § 6233. Interest and penalties
##### (a) Interest and penalties determined from reviewed year

(1) In general

Except to the extent provided in section 6226(c), in the case of a partnership adjustment for a reviewed year

(A) interest shall be computed under paragraph (2), and

(B) the partnership shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount as provided in paragraph (3).

(2) Determination of amount of interest

The interest computed under this paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment is the interest which would be determined under chapter 67 for the period beginning on the day after the return due date for the reviewed year and ending on the return due date for the adjustment year (or, if earlier, the date payment of the imputed underpayment is made). Proper adjustments in the amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be made for adjustments required for partnership taxable years after the reviewed year and before the adjustment year by reason of such partnership adjustment.

(3) Penalties

Any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount shall be determined at the partnership level as if such partnership had been an individual subject to tax under chapter 1 for the reviewed year and the imputed underpayment were an actual underpayment (or understatement) for such year.
