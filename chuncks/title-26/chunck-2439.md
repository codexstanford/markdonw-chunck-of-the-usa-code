#### § 692. Income taxes of members of Armed Forces, astronauts, and victims of certain terrorist attacks on death
##### (d) Individuals dying as a result of certain attacks

(1) In general

In the case of a specified terrorist victim, any tax imposed by this chapter shall not apply

(A) with respect to the taxable year in which falls the date of death, and

(B) with respect to any prior taxable year in the period beginning with the last taxable year ending before the taxable year in which the wounds, injury, or illness referred to in paragraph (3) were incurred.

(2) $10,000 minimum benefit

If, but for this paragraph, the amount of tax not imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to a specified terrorist victim is less than $10,000, then such victim shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by this chapter for such victim’s last taxable year in an amount equal to the excess of $10,000 over the amount of tax not so imposed.

(3) Taxation of certain benefits

Subject to such rules as the Secretary may prescribe, paragraph (1) shall not apply to the amount of any tax imposed by this chapter which would be computed by only taking into account the items of income, gain, or other amounts attributable to

(A) deferred compensation which would have been payable after death if the individual had died other than as a specified terrorist victim, or

(B) amounts payable in the taxable year which would not have been payable in such taxable year but for an action taken after September 11, 2001 .

(4) Specified terrorist victim

For purposes of this subsection, the term “specified terrorist victim” means any decedent

(A) who dies as a result of wounds or injury incurred as a result of the terrorist attacks against the United States on April 19, 1995 , or September 11, 2001 , or

(B) who dies as a result of illness incurred as a result of an attack involving anthrax occurring on or after September 11, 2001 , and before January 1, 2002 . Such term shall not include any individual identified by the Attorney General to have been a participant or conspirator in any such attack or a representative of such an individual.

(5) Relief with respect to astronauts

The provisions of this subsection shall apply to any astronaut whose death occurs in the line of duty, except that paragraph (3)(B) shall be applied by using the date of the death of the astronaut rather than September 11, 2001 .
