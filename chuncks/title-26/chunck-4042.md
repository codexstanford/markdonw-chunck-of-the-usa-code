## Subtitle B— Estate and Gift Taxes
### CHAPTER 13— TAX ON GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFERS
#### § 2654. Special rules
##### (d) Limitation on personal liability of trustee

A trustee shall not be personally liable for any increase in the tax imposed by section 2601 which is attributable to the fact that

(1) section 2642(c) (relating to exemption of certain nontaxable gifts) does not apply to a transfer to the trust which was made during the life of the transferor and for which a gift tax return was not filed, or

(2) the inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is greater than the amount of such ratio as computed on the basis of the return on which was made (or was deemed made) an allocation of the GST exemption to property transferred to such trust. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the trustee has knowledge of facts sufficient reasonably to conclude that a gift tax return was required to be filed or that the inclusion ratio was erroneous.
