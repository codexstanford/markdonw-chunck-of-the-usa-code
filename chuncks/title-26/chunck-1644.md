#### § 409. Qualifications for tax credit employee stock ownership plans
##### (g) Transferred amounts must stay in plan even though investment credit is redetermined or recaptured

A plan meets the requirement of this subsection only if it provides that amounts which are transferred to the plan (because of the requirements of section 48(n)(1) or 41(c)(1)(B))  1 shall remain in the plan (and, if allocated under the plan, shall remain so allocated) even though part or all of the employee plan credit or the credit allowed under section 41  1 (relating to employee stock ownership credit) is recaptured or redetermined. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the references to section 48(n)(1)  1 and the employee plan credit shall refer to such section and credit as in effect before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984.
