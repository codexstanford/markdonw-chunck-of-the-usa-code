##### (e) Special rules

(1) Treatment of former tax-exempt use property

(A) In general

In the case of any former tax-exempt use property

(i) any deduction allowable under subsection (b) with respect to such property for any taxable year shall be allowed only to the extent of any net income (without regard to such deduction) from such property for such taxable year, and

(ii) any portion of such unused deduction remaining after application of clause (i) shall be treated as a deduction allowable under subsection (b) with respect to such property in the next taxable year.

(B) Former tax-exempt use property

For purposes of this subsection, the term “former tax-exempt use property” means any property which

(i) is not tax-exempt use property for the taxable year, but

(ii) was tax-exempt use property for any prior taxable year.

(2) Disposition of entire interest in property

If during the taxable year a taxpayer disposes of the taxpayer’s entire interest in tax-exempt use property (or former tax-exempt use property), rules similar to the rules of section 469(g) shall apply for purposes of this section.

(3) Coordination with section 469

This section shall be applied before the application of section 469.

(4) Coordination with sections 1031 and 1033

(A) In general

Sections 1031(a) and 1033(a) shall not apply if

(i) the exchanged or converted property is tax-exempt use property subject to a lease which was entered into before March 13, 2004 , and which would not have met the requirements of subsection (d) had such requirements been in effect when the lease was entered into, or

(ii) the replacement property is tax-exempt use property subject to a lease which does not meet the requirements of subsection (d).

(B) Adjusted basis

In the case of property acquired by the lessor in a transaction to which section 1031 or 1033 applies, the adjusted basis of such property for purposes of this section shall be equal to the lesser of

(i) the fair market value of the property as of the beginning of the lease term, or

(ii) the amount which would be the lessor’s adjusted basis if such sections did not apply to such transaction.
