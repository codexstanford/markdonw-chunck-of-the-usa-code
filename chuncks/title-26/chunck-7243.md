## Subtitle F— Procedure and Administration
### CHAPTER 77— MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
#### § 7527A. Advance payment of child tax credit
##### (b) Annual advance amount

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term “annual advance amount” means, with respect to any taxpayer for any calendar year, the amount (if any) which is estimated by the Secretary as being equal to 50 percent of the amount which would be treated as allowed under subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 by reason of section 24(i)(1) for the taxpayer’s taxable year beginning in such calendar year if

(A) the status of the taxpayer as a taxpayer described in section 24(i)(1) is determined with respect to the reference taxable year,

(B) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year is equal to the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income for the reference taxable year,

(C) the only children of such taxpayer for such taxable year are qualifying children properly claimed on the taxpayer’s return of tax for the reference taxable year, and

(D) the ages of such children (and the status of such children as qualifying children) are determined for such taxable year by taking into account the passage of time since the reference taxable year.

(2) Reference taxable year

Except as provided in paragraph (3)(A), the term “reference taxable year” means, with respect to any taxpayer for any calendar year, the taxpayer’s taxable year beginning in the preceding calendar year or, in the case of taxpayer who did not file a return of tax for such taxable year, the taxpayer’s taxable year beginning in the second preceding calendar year.

(3) Modifications during calendar year

(A) In general

The Secretary may modify, during any calendar year, the annual advance amount with respect to any taxpayer for such calendar year to take into account

(i) a return of tax filed by such taxpayer during such calendar year (and the taxable year to which such return relates may be taken into account as the reference taxable year), and

(ii) any other information provided by the taxpayer to the Secretary which allows the Secretary to determine payments under subsection (a) which, in the aggregate during any taxable year of the taxpayer, more closely total the Secretary’s estimate of the amount treated as allowed under subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 by reason of section 24(i)(1) for such taxable year of such taxpayer.

(B) Adjustment to reflect excess or deficit in prior payments

In the case of any modification of the annual advance amount under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may adjust the amount of any periodic payment made after the date of such modification to properly take into account the amount by which any periodic payment made before such date was greater than or less than the amount that such payment would have been on the basis of the annual advance amount as so modified.

(4) Determination of status

If information contained in the taxpayer’s return of tax for the reference taxable year does not establish the status of the taxpayer as being described in section 24(i)(1), the Secretary shall, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), determine such status based on information known to the Secretary.

(5) Treatment of certain deaths

A child shall not be taken into account in determining the annual advance amount under paragraph (1) if the death of such child is known to the Secretary as of the beginning of the calendar year for which the estimate under such paragraph is made.
