#### § 433. Minimum funding standards for CSEC plans
##### (a) General rule

For purposes of section 412, the term “accumulated funding deficiency” for a CSEC plan means the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which section 412 applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years.
