##### (d) Survivor annuities need not be provided if participant and spouse married less than 1 year

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), a plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) merely because the plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor annuity (or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity) will not be provided unless the participant and spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of

(A) the participant’s annuity starting date, or

(B) the date of the participant’s death.

(2) Treatment of certain marriages within 1 year of annuity starting date for purposes of qualified joint and survivor annuities

For purposes of paragraph (1), if

(A) a participant marries within 1 year before the annuity starting date, and

(B) the participant and the participant’s spouse in such marriage have been married for at least a 1-year period ending on or before the date of the participant’s death, such participant and such spouse shall be treated as having been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the participant’s annuity starting date.
