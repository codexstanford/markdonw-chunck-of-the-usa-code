#### § 5008. Abatement, remission, refund, and allowance for loss or destruction of distilled spirits
##### (a) Distilled spirits lost or destroyed in bond

(1) Extent of loss allowance

No tax shall be collected in respect of distilled spirits lost or destroyed while in bond, except that such tax shall be collected

(A) Theft

In the case of loss by theft, unless the Secretary finds that the theft occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or the employees or agents of any of them;

(B) Voluntary destruction

In the case of voluntary destruction, unless such destruction is carried out as provided in subsection (b); and

(C) Unexplained shortage

In the case of an unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits.

(2) Proof of loss

In any case in which distilled spirits are lost or destroyed, whether by theft or otherwise, the Secretary may require the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant or other person liable for the tax to file a claim for relief from the tax and submit proof as to the cause of such loss. In every case where it appears that the loss was by theft, the burden shall be upon the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant or other person responsible for the distilled spirits tax to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such loss did not occur as the result of connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or the employees or agents of any of them.

(3) Refund of tax

In any case where the tax would not be collectible by virtue of paragraph (1), but such tax has been paid, the Secretary shall refund such tax.

(4) Limitations

Except as provided in paragraph (5), no tax shall be abated, remitted, credited, or refunded under this subsection where the loss occurred after the tax was determined (as provided in section 5006(a)). The abatement, remission, credit, or refund of taxes provided for by paragraphs (1) and (3) in the case of loss of distilled spirits by theft shall only be allowed to the extent that the claimant is not indemnified against or recompensed in respect of the tax for such loss.

(5) Applicability

The provisions of this subsection shall extend to and apply in respect of distilled spirits lost after the tax was determined and before completion of the physical removal of the distilled spirits from the bonded premises.
