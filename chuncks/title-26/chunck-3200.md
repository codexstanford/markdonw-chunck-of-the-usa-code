#### § 1060. Special allocation rules for certain asset acquisitions
##### (a) General rule

In the case of any applicable asset acquisition, for purposes of determining both

(1) the transferee’s basis in such assets, and

(2) the gain or loss of the transferor with respect to such acquisition, the consideration received for such assets shall be allocated among such assets acquired in such acquisition in the same manner as amounts are allocated to assets under section 338(b)(5). If in connection with an applicable asset acquisition, the transferee and transferor agree in writing as to the allocation of any consideration, or as to the fair market value of any of the assets, such agreement shall be binding on both the transferee and transferor unless the Secretary determines that such allocation (or fair market value) is not appropriate.
