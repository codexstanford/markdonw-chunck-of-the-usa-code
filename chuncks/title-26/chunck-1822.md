### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 433. Minimum funding standards for CSEC plans
##### (j) Funding restoration status

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section

(1) Normal cost payment

(A) In general

In the case of a CSEC plan that is in funding restoration status for a plan year, for purposes of section 412, the term “accumulated funding deficiency” means, for such plan year, the greater of

(i) the amount described in subsection (a), or

(ii) the excess of the normal cost of the plan for the plan year over the amount actually contributed to or under the plan for the plan year.

(B) Normal cost

In the case of a CSEC plan that uses a spread gain funding method, for purposes of this subsection, the term “normal cost” means normal cost as determined under the entry age normal funding method.

(2) Plan amendments

In the case of a CSEC plan that is in funding restoration status for a plan year, no amendment to such plan may take effect during such plan year if such amendment has the effect of increasing liabilities of the plan by means of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment that is required to comply with any applicable law. This paragraph shall cease to apply with respect to any plan year, effective as of the first day of the plan year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment) upon payment by the plan sponsor of a contribution to the plan (in addition to any contribution required under this section without regard to this paragraph) in an amount equal to the increase in the funding liability of the plan attributable to the plan amendment.

(3) Funding restoration plan

The sponsor of a CSEC plan shall establish a written funding restoration plan within 180 days of the receipt by the plan sponsor of a certification from the plan actuary that the plan is in funding restoration status for a plan year. Such funding restoration plan shall consist of actions that are calculated, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to increase the plan’s funded percentage to 100 percent over a period that is not longer than the greater of 7 years or the shortest amount of time practicable. Such funding restoration plan shall take into account contributions required under this section (without regard to this paragraph). If a plan remains in funding restoration status for 2 or more years, such funding restoration plan shall be updated each year after the 1st such year within 180 days of receipt by the plan sponsor of a certification from the plan actuary that the plan remains in funding restoration status for the plan year.

(4) Annual certification by plan actuary

Not later than the 90th day of each plan year of a CSEC plan, the plan actuary shall certify to the plan sponsor whether or not the plan is in funding restoration status for the plan year, based on the plan’s funded percentage as of the beginning of the plan year. For this purpose, the actuary may conclusively rely on an estimate of

(A) the plan’s funding liability, based on the funding liability of the plan for the preceding plan year and on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods, and

(B) the amount of any contributions reasonably anticipated to be made for the preceding plan year. Contributions described in subparagraph (B) shall be taken into account in determining the plan’s funded percentage as of the beginning of the plan year.

(5) Definitions

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Funding restoration status

A CSEC plan shall be treated as in funding restoration status for a plan year if the plan’s funded percentage as of the beginning of such plan year is less than 80 percent.

(B) Funded percentage

The term “funded percentage” means the ratio (expressed as a percentage) which

(i) the value of plan assets (as determined under subsection (c)(2)), bears to

(ii) the plan’s funding liability.

(C) Funding liability

The term “funding liability” for a plan year means the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, based on the assumptions used by the plan pursuant to this section, including the interest rate described in subsection (b)(5)(A) (without regard to subsection (b)(5)(B)).

(D) Spread gain funding method

The term “spread gain funding method” has the meaning given such term under rules and forms issued by the Secretary.

(E) Plan sponsor

The term “plan sponsor” means, with respect to a CSEC plan, the association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar group of representatives of the parties who establish or maintain the plan.
