#### § 2514. Powers of appointment
##### (a) Powers created on or before October 21, 1942

An exercise of a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942 , shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power; but the failure to exercise such a power or the complete release of such a power shall not be deemed an exercise thereof. If a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942 , has been partially released so that it is no longer a general power of appointment, the subsequent exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be the exercise of a general power of appointment if

(1) such partial release occurred before November 1, 1951 , or

(2) the donee of such power was under a legal disability to release such power on October 21, 1942 , and such partial release occurred not later than six months after the termination of such legal disability.
