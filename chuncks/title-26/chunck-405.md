##### (b) Emissions factors

(1) Emissions factor

(A) Calculation

(i) In general

The emissions factor of a transportation fuel shall be an amount equal to the quotient of

(I) an amount equal to

(aa) 50 kilograms of CO 2 e per mmBTU, minus

(bb) the emissions rate for such fuel, divided by

(II) 50 kilograms of CO 2 e per mmBTU.

(B) Establishment of emissions rate

(i) In general

Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), the Secretary shall annually publish a table which sets forth the emissions rate for similar types and categories of transportation fuels based on the amount of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (as described in section 211( o )(1)(H) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7545 ( o )(1)(H)), as in effect on the date of the enactment of this section) for such fuels, expressed as kilograms of CO 2 e per mmBTU, which a taxpayer shall use for purposes of this section.

(ii) Non-aviation fuel

In the case of any transportation fuel which is not a sustainable aviation fuel, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of such fuel shall be based on the most recent determinations under the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model developed by Argonne National Laboratory, or a successor model (as determined by the Secretary).

(iii) Aviation fuel

In the case of any transportation fuel which is a sustainable aviation fuel, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of such fuel shall be determined in accordance with

(I) the most recent Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation which has been adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the agreement of the United States, or

(II) any similar methodology which satisfies the criteria under section 211( o )(1)(H) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7545 ( o )(1)(H)), as in effect on the date of enactment of this section.

(C) Rounding of emissions rate

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may round the emissions rates under subparagraph (B) to the nearest multiple of 5 kilograms of CO 2 e per mmBTU.

(ii) Exception

In the case of an emissions rate that is between 2.5 kilograms of CO 2 e per mmBTU and -2.5 kilograms of CO 2 e per mmBTU, the Secretary may round such rate to zero.

(D) Provisional emissions rate

In the case of any transportation fuel for which an emissions rate has not been established under subparagraph (B), a taxpayer producing such fuel may file a petition with the Secretary for determination of the emissions rate with respect to such fuel.

(2) Rounding

If any amount determined under paragraph (1)(A) is not a multiple of 0.1, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1.
