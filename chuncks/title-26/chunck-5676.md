### CHAPTER 61— INFORMATION AND RETURNS
#### § 6045. Returns of brokers
##### (e) Return required in the case of real estate transactions

(1) In general

In the case of a real estate transaction, the real estate reporting person shall file a return under subsection (a) and a statement under subsection (b) with respect to such transaction.

(2) Real estate reporting person

For purposes of this subsection, the term “real estate reporting person” means any of the following persons involved in a real estate transaction in the following order:

(A) the person (including any attorney or title company) responsible for closing the transaction,

(B) the mortgage lender,

(C) the seller’s broker,

(D) the buyer’s broker, or

(E) such other person designated in regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Any person treated as a real estate reporting person under the preceding sentence shall be treated as a broker for purposes of subsection (c)(1).

(3) Prohibition of separate charge for filing return

It shall be unlawful for any real estate reporting person to separately charge any customer for complying with any requirement of paragraph (1). Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the real estate reporting person from taking into account its cost of complying with such requirement in establishing its charge (other than a separate charge for complying with such requirement) to any customer for performing services in the case of a real estate transaction.

(4) Additional information required

In the case of a real estate transaction involving a residence, the real estate reporting person shall include the following information on the return under subsection (a) and on the statement under subsection (b):

(A) The portion of any real property tax which is treated as a tax imposed on the purchaser by reason of section 164(d)(1)(B).

(B) Whether or not the financing (if any) of the seller was federally-subsidized indebtedness (as defined in section 143(m)(3)).

(5) Exception for sales or exchanges of certain principal residences

(A) In general

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any sale or exchange of a residence for $250,000 or less if the person referred to in paragraph (2) receives written assurance in a form acceptable to the Secretary from the seller that

(i) such residence is the principal residence (within the meaning of section 121) of the seller,

(ii) if the Secretary requires the inclusion on the return under subsection (a) of information as to whether there is federally subsidized mortgage financing assistance with respect to the mortgage on residences, that there is no such assistance with respect to the mortgage on such residence, and

(iii) the full amount of the gain on such sale or exchange is excludable from gross income under section 121. If such assurance includes an assurance that the seller is married, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting “$500,000” for “$250,000”. The Secretary may by regulation increase the dollar amounts under this subparagraph if the Secretary determines that such an increase will not materially reduce revenues to the Treasury.

(B) Seller

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “seller” includes the person relinquishing the residence in an exchange.
