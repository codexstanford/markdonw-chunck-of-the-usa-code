### CHAPTER 61— INFORMATION AND RETURNS
#### § 6033. Returns by exempt organizations
##### (e) Special rules relating to lobbying activities

(1) Reporting requirements

(A) In general

If this subsection applies to an organization for any taxable year, such organization

(i) shall include on any return required to be filed under subsection (a) for such year information setting forth the total expenditures of the organization to which section 162(e)(1) applies and the total amount of the dues or other similar amounts paid to the organization to which such expenditures are allocable, and

(ii) except as provided in paragraphs (2)(A)(i) and (3), shall, at the time of assessment or payment of such dues or other similar amounts, provide notice to each person making such payment which contains a reasonable estimate of the portion of such dues or other similar amounts to which such expenditures are so allocable.

(B) Organizations to which subsection applies

(i) In general

This subsection shall apply to any organization which is exempt from taxation under section 501 other than an organization described in section 501(c)(3).

(ii) Special rule for in-house expenditures

This subsection shall not apply to the in-house expenditures (within the meaning of section 162(e)(4)(B)(ii)) of an organization for a taxable year if such expenditures do not exceed $2,000. In determining whether a taxpayer exceeds the $2,000 limit under this clause, there shall not be taken into account overhead costs otherwise allocable to activities described in subparagraphs (A) and (D) of section 162(e)(1).

(iii) Coordination with section 527(f)

This subsection shall not apply to any amount on which tax is imposed by reason of section 527(f).

(C) Allocation

For purposes of this paragraph

(i) In general

Expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies shall be treated as paid out of dues or other similar amounts to the extent thereof.

(ii) Carryover of lobbying expenditures in excess of dues

If expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies exceed the dues or other similar amounts for any taxable year, such excess shall be treated as expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies which are paid or incurred by the organization during the following taxable year.

(2) Tax imposed where organization does not notify

(A) In general

If an organization

(i) elects not to provide the notices described in paragraph (1)(A) for any taxable year, or

(ii) fails to include in such notices the amount allocable to expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies (determined on the basis of actual amounts rather than the reasonable estimates under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)), then there is hereby imposed on such organization for such taxable year a tax in an amount equal to the product of the highest rate of tax imposed by section 11 for the taxable year and the aggregate amount not included in such notices by reason of such election or failure.

(B) Waiver where future adjustments made

The Secretary may waive the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) for any taxable year if the organization agrees to adjust its estimates under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) for the following taxable year to correct any failures.

(C) Tax treated as income tax

For purposes of this title, the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) shall be treated in the same manner as a tax imposed by chapter 1 (relating to income taxes).

(3) Exception where dues generally nondeductible

Paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply to an organization which establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that substantially all of the dues or other similar amounts paid by persons to such organization are not deductible without regard to section 162(e).
