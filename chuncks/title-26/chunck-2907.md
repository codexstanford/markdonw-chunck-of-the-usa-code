(2) Foreign oil related income

The term “foreign oil related income” means the taxable income derived from sources outside the United States and its possessions from

(A) the processing of minerals extracted (by the taxpayer or by any other person) from oil or gas wells into their primary products,

(B) the transportation of such minerals or primary products,

(3) Dividends, interest, partnership distribution, etc.

The term “foreign oil and gas extraction income” and the term “foreign oil related income” include

(B) amounts with respect to which taxes are deemed paid under section 960, and

(C) the taxpayer’s distributive share of the income of partnerships, to the extent such dividends, interest, amounts, or distributive share is attributable to foreign oil and gas extraction income, or to foreign oil related income, as the case may be; except that interest described in subparagraph (A) shall not be taken into account in computing foreign oil and gas extraction income but shall be taken into account in computing foreign oil-related income.

(4) Recapture of foreign oil and gas losses by recharacterizing later combined foreign oil and gas income

(I) the aggregate amount of foreign oil extraction losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982 , and before January 1, 2009 , over

(II) so much of such aggregate amount as was recharacterized under this paragraph (as in effect before and after the date of the enactment of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008) for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982 .

(C) Reduction for post-2008 foreign oil and gas losses

The reduction under this paragraph shall be equal to the lesser of

(i) the combined foreign oil and gas income of the taxpayer for the taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph), reduced by an amount equal to the reduction under subparagraph (A) for the taxable year, or

(ii) the excess of

(I) the aggregate amount of foreign oil and gas losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008 , over

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “foreign oil and gas loss” means the amount by which

(II) the sum of the deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto.
