##### (e) Definitions

For purposes of this section

(1) Applicable electric generating unit

The term “applicable electric generating unit” means the principal electric generating unit for which the carbon capture equipment is originally planned and designed.

(2) Baseline carbon oxide production

(A) In general

The term “baseline carbon oxide production” means either of the following:

(i) In the case of an applicable electric generating unit which was originally placed in service more than 1 year prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins, the average annual carbon oxide production, by mass, from such unit during

(I) in the case of an applicable electric generating unit which was originally placed in service more than 1 year prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins and on or after the date which is 3 years prior to the date on which construction of such equipment begins, the period beginning on the date such unit was placed in service and ending on the date on which construction of such equipment began, and

(II) in the case of an applicable electric generating unit which was originally placed in service more than 3 years prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins, the 3 years with the highest annual carbon oxide production during the 12-year period preceding the date on which construction of such equipment began.

(ii) In the case of an applicable electric generating unit which

(I) as of the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins, is not yet placed in service, or

(II) was placed in service during the 1-year period prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins,  the designed annual carbon oxide production, by mass, as determined based on an assumed capacity factor of 60 percent.

(B) Capacity factor

The term “capacity factor” means the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the actual electric output from the applicable electric generating unit to the potential electric output from such unit.

(3) Direct air capture facility

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the term “direct air capture facility” means any facility which uses carbon capture equipment to capture carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air.

(B) Exception

The term “direct air capture facility” shall not include any facility which captures carbon dioxide

(i) which is deliberately released from naturally occurring subsurface springs, or

(ii) using natural photosynthesis.

(4) Qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project

The term “qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project” has the meaning given the term “qualified enhanced oil recovery project” by section 43(c)(2), by substituting “crude oil or natural gas” for “crude oil” in subparagraph (A)(i) thereof.

(5) Tertiary injectant

The term “tertiary injectant” has the same meaning as when used within section 193(b)(1).
