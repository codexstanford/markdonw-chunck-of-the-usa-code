#### § 45K. Credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source
##### (b) Limitations and adjustments

(1) Phaseout of credit

The amount of the credit allowable under subsection (a) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as

(A) the amount by which the reference price for the calendar year in which the sale occurs exceeds $23.50, bears to

(B) $6.

(2) Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation

The $3 amount in subsection (a) and the $23.50 and $6 amounts in paragraph (1) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. In the case of gas from a tight formation, the $3 amount in subsection (a) shall not be adjusted.

(3) Credit reduced for grants, tax-exempt bonds, and subsidized energy financing

(A) In general

The amount of the credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1) and (2)) shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the amount so determined for such year and a fraction

(i) the numerator of which is the sum, for the taxable year and all prior taxable years, of

(I) grants provided by the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State for use in connection with the project,

(II) proceeds of any issue of State or local government obligations used to provide financing for the project the interest on which is exempt from tax under section 103, and

(III) the aggregate amount of subsidized energy financing (within the meaning of section 48(a)(4)(C)) provided in connection with the project, and

(ii) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of additions to the capital account for the project for the taxable year and all prior taxable years.

(B) Amounts determined at close of year

The amounts under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall be determined as of the close of the taxable year.

(4) Credit reduced for energy credit

The amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)) shall be reduced by the excess of

(A) the aggregate amount allowed under section 38 for the taxable year or any prior taxable year by reason of the energy percentage with respect to property used in the project, over

(B) the aggregate amount recaptured with respect to the amount described in subparagraph (A)

(i) under section 49(b) or 50(a) for the taxable year or any prior taxable year, or

(ii) under this paragraph for any prior taxable year. The amount recaptured under section 49(b) or 50(a) with respect to any property shall be appropriately reduced to take into account any reduction in the credit allowed by this section by reason of the preceding sentence.

(5) Credit reduced for enhanced oil recovery credit

The amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after application of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4)) shall be reduced by the excess (if any) of

(A) the aggregate amount allowed under section 38 for the taxable year and any prior taxable year by reason of any enhanced oil recovery credit determined under section 43 with respect to such project, over

(B) the aggregate amount recaptured with respect to the amount described in subparagraph (A) under this paragraph for any prior taxable year.
