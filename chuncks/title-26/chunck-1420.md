#### § 312. Effect on earnings and profits
##### (g) Earnings and profits—increase in value accrued before March 1, 1913

(1) If any increase or decrease in the earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913 , with respect to any matter would be different had the adjusted basis of the property involved been determined without regard to its March 1, 1913 , value, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), an increase (properly reflecting such difference) shall be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913 .

(2) If the application of subsection (f) to a sale or other disposition after February 28, 1913 , results in a loss which is to be applied in decrease of earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913 , then, notwithstanding subsection (f) and in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of such loss so to be applied shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the adjusted basis of the property used in determining the loss exceeds the adjusted basis computed without regard to the value of the property on March 1, 1913 , and if such amount so applied in reduction of the decrease exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913 .
