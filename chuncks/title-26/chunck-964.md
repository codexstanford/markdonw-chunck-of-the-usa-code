#### § 165. Losses
##### (j) Denial of deduction for losses on certain obligations not in registered form

(1) In general

Nothing in subsection (a) or in any other provision of law shall be construed to provide a deduction for any loss sustained on any registration-required obligation unless such obligation is in registered form (or the issuance of such obligation was subject to tax under section 4701).

(2) Definitions

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Registration-required obligation

The term “registration-required obligation” has the meaning given to such term by section 163(f)(2).

(B) Registered form

The term “registered form” has the same meaning as when used in section 163(f).

(3) Exceptions

The Secretary may, by regulations, provide that this subsection and section 1287 shall not apply with respect to obligations held by any person if

(A) such person holds such obligations in connection with a trade or business outside the United States,

(B) such person holds such obligations as a broker dealer (registered under Federal or State law) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business,

(C) such person complies with reporting requirements with respect to ownership, transfers, and payments as the Secretary may require, or

(D) such person promptly surrenders the obligation to the issuer for the issuance of a new obligation in registered form, but only if such obligations are held under arrangements provided in regulations or otherwise which are designed to assure that such obligations are not delivered to any United States person other than a person described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).
