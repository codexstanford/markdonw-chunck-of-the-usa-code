(1) In general

A taxpayer which computes taxable income under the accrual method of accounting, and receives any advance payment during the taxable year, shall

(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), include such advance payment in gross income for such taxable year, or

(B) if the taxpayer elects the application of this subparagraph with respect to the category of advance payments to which such advance payment belongs, the taxpayer shall

(i) to the extent that any portion of such advance payment is required under subsection (b) to be included in gross income in the taxable year in which such payment is received, so include such portion, and

(ii) include the remaining portion of such advance payment in gross income in the taxable year following the taxable year in which such payment is received.

(2) Election

(A) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the election under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made at such time, in such form and manner, and with respect to such categories of advance payments, as the Secretary may provide.

An election under paragraph (1)(B) shall be effective for the taxable year with respect to which it is first made and for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer secures the consent of the Secretary to revoke such election. For purposes of this title, the computation of taxable income under an election made under paragraph (1)(B) shall be treated as a method of accounting.
