#### § 3305. Applicability of State law
##### (c) National banks

Nothing contained in section 5240 of the Revised Statutes, as amended ( 12 U.S.C. 484 ), shall prevent any State from requiring any national banking association to render returns and reports relative to the association’s employees, their remuneration and services, to the same extent that other persons are required to render like returns and reports under a State law requiring contributions to an unemployment fund. The Comptroller of the Currency shall, upon receipt of a copy of any such return or report of a national banking association from, and upon request of, any duly authorized official, body, or commission of a State, cause an examination of the correctness of such return or report to be made at the time of the next succeeding examination of such association, and shall thereupon transmit to such official, body, or commission a complete statement of his findings respecting the accuracy of such returns or reports.
