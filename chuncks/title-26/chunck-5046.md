#### § 5121. Recordkeeping by wholesale dealers
##### (c) Wholesale dealers

For purposes of this part

(1) Wholesale dealer in liquors

The term “wholesale dealer in liquors” means any dealer (other than a wholesale dealer in beer) who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer, to another dealer.

(2) Wholesale dealer in beer

The term “wholesale dealer in beer” means any dealer who sells, or offers for sale, beer, but not distilled spirits or wines, to another dealer.

(3) Dealer

The term “dealer” means any person who sells, or offers for sale, any distilled spirits, wines, or beer.

(4) Presumption in case of sale of 20 wine gallons or more

The sale, or offer for sale, of distilled spirits, wines, or beer, in quantities of 20 wine gallons or more to the same person at the same time, shall be presumptive evidence that the person making such sale, or offer for sale, is engaged in or carrying on the business of a wholesale dealer in liquors or a wholesale dealer in beer, as the case may be. Such presumption may be overcome by evidence satisfactorily showing that such sale, or offer for sale, was made to a person other than a dealer.
