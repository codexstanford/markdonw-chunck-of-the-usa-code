(B) the closing of such short sale occurs on or before the 45th day after the date of such short sale, then no deduction shall be allowed for such payment. The basis of the stock used to close the short sale shall be increased by the amount not allowed as a deduction by reason of the preceding sentence.

(2) Longer period in case of extraordinary dividends

If the payment described in paragraph (1)(A) is in respect of an extraordinary dividend, paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied by substituting “the day 1 year after the date of such short sale” for “the 45th day after the date of such short sale”.

(3) Extraordinary dividend

(B) Exception not to apply to extraordinary dividends

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if one or more payments or distributions is in respect of an extraordinary dividend.
