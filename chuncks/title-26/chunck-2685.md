#### § 856. Definition of real estate investment trust
##### (f) Interest

(1) In general

For purposes of paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B) of subsection (c), the term “interest” does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except that

(A) any amount so received or accrued shall not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, and

(B) where a real estate investment trust receives any amount which would be excluded from the term “interest” solely because the debtor of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from the debtor will be excluded from the term “interest”.

(2) Special rule

If

(A) a real estate investment trust receives or accrues with respect to an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property or an interest in real property amounts from a debtor which derives substantially all of its gross income with respect to such property (not taking into account any gain on any disposition) from the leasing of substantially all of its interests in such property to tenants, and

(B) a portion of the amount which such debtor receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from tenants consists of qualified rents (as defined in subsection (d)(6)(B)), then the amounts which the trust receives or accrues from such debtor shall not be excluded from the term “interest” by reason of being based on the income or profits of such debtor to the extent the amounts so received are attributable to qualified rents received or accrued by such debtor.
