##### (d) Rents from real property defined

(1) Amounts included

For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the term “rents from real property” includes (subject to paragraph (2))

(A) rents from interests in real property,

(B) charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property, whether or not such charges are separately stated, and

(C) rent attributable to personal property which is leased under, or in connection with, a lease of real property, but only if the rent attributable to such personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15 percent of the total rent for the taxable year attributable to both the real and personal property leased under, or in connection with, such lease. For purposes of subparagraph (C), with respect to each lease of real property, rent attributable to personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent for the taxable year as the average of the fair market values of the personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the average of the aggregate fair market values of both the real property and the personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year.

(2) Amounts excluded

For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the term “rents from real property” does not include

(A) except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (6), any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real or personal property, if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property (except that any amount so received or accrued shall not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales);

(B) except as provided in paragraph (8), any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly from any person if the real estate investment trust owns, directly or indirectly

(i) in the case of any person which is a corporation, stock of such person possessing 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 10 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such person; or

(ii) in the case of any person which is not a corporation, an interest of 10 percent or more in the assets or net profits of such person; and

(C) any impermissible tenant service income (as defined in paragraph (7)).

(3) Independent contractor defined

For purposes of this subsection and subsection (e), the term “independent contractor” means any person

(A) who does not own, directly or indirectly, more than 35 percent of the shares, or certificates of beneficial interest, in the real estate investment trust; and

(B) if such person is a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the total combined voting power of whose stock (or 35 percent of the total shares of all classes of whose stock), or, if such person is not a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the interest in whose assets or net profits is owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons owning 35 percent or more of the shares or certificates of beneficial interest in the trust. In the event that any class of stock of either the real estate investment trust or such person is regularly traded on an established securities market, only persons who own, directly or indirectly, more than 5 percent of such class of stock shall be taken into account as owning any of the stock of such class for purposes of applying the 35 percent limitation set forth in subparagraph (B) (but all of the outstanding stock of such class shall be considered outstanding in order to compute the denominator for purpose of determining the applicable percentage of ownership).

(4) Special rule for certain contingent rents

Where a real estate investment trust receives or accrues, with respect to real or personal property, any amount which would be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely because the tenant of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from subtenants any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from that tenant will be excluded from the term “rents from real property”.

(5) Constructive ownership of stock

For purposes of this subsection, the rules prescribed by section 318(a) for determining the ownership of stock shall apply in determining the ownership of stock, assets, or net profits of any person; except that

(A) “10 percent” shall be substituted for “50 percent” in subparagraph (C) of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 318(a), and

(B) section 318(a)(3)(A) shall be applied in the case of a partnership by taking into account only partners who own (directly or indirectly) 25 percent or more of the capital interest, or the profits interest, in the partnership.

(6) Special rule for certain property subleased by tenant of real estate investment trusts

(A) In general

If

(i) a real estate investment trust receives or accrues, with respect to real or personal property, amounts from a tenant which derives substantially all of its income with respect to such property from the subleasing of substantially all of such property, and

(ii) a portion of the amount such tenant receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from subtenants consists of qualified rents, then the amounts which the trust receives or accrues from the tenant shall not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” by reason of being based on the income or profits of such tenant to the extent the amounts so received or accrued are attributable to qualified rents received or accrued by such tenant.

(B) Qualified rents

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “qualified rents” means any amount which would be treated as rents from real property if received by the real estate investment trust.

If the amount described in subparagraph (A) with respect to a property for any taxable year exceeds 1 percent of all amounts received or accrued during such taxable year directly or indirectly by the real estate investment trust with respect to such property, the impermissible tenant service income of the trust with respect to the property shall include all such amounts.

(C) Exceptions

(D) Amount attributable to impermissible services

(8) Special rule for taxable REIT subsidiaries

For purposes of this subsection, amounts paid to a real estate investment trust by a taxable REIT subsidiary of such trust shall not be excluded from rents from real property by reason of paragraph (2)(B) if the requirements of either of the following subparagraphs are met:

(A) Limited rental exception

(I) at the time such lease is entered into,

(II) at the time of each extension of the lease, including a failure to exercise a right to terminate, and

(III) at the time of any modification of the lease between the trust and the taxable REIT subsidiary if the rent under such lease is effectively increased pursuant to such modification.  With respect to subclause (III), if the taxable REIT subsidiary of the trust is a controlled taxable REIT subsidiary of the trust, the term “rents from real property” shall not in any event include rent under such lease to the extent of the increase in such rent on account of such modification.

(iv) Controlled taxable REIT subsidiary

For purposes of clause (iii), the term “controlled taxable REIT subsidiary” means, with respect to any real estate investment trust, any taxable REIT subsidiary of such trust if such trust owns directly or indirectly
