The requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to any land if

For purposes of this paragraph and section 144(a), the acquisition by a first-time farmer of land or personal property from a related person (within the meaning of section 144(a)(3)) shall not be treated as an acquisition from a related person, if

If any amount as increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $100, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100.
