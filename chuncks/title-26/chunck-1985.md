#### § 468A. Special rules for nuclear decommissioning costs
##### (f) Transfers into qualified funds

(1) In general

Notwithstanding subsection (b), any taxpayer maintaining a Fund to which this section applies with respect to a nuclear power plant may transfer into such Fund not more than an amount equal to the present value of the portion of the total nuclear decommissioning costs with respect to such nuclear power plant previously excluded for such nuclear power plant under subsection (d)(2)(A) as in effect immediately before the date of the enactment of this subsection.

(2) Deduction for amounts transferred

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the deduction allowed by subsection (a) for any transfer permitted by this subsection shall be allowed ratably over the remaining estimated useful life (within the meaning of subsection (d)(2)(A)) of the nuclear power plant beginning with the taxable year during which the transfer is made.

(B) Denial of deduction for previously deducted amounts

No deduction shall be allowed for any transfer under this subsection of an amount for which a deduction was previously allowed to the taxpayer (or a predecessor) or a corresponding amount was not included in gross income of the taxpayer (or a predecessor). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a ratable portion of each transfer shall be treated as being from previously deducted or excluded amounts to the extent thereof.

(C) Transfers of qualified funds

If

(i) any transfer permitted by this subsection is made to any Fund to which this section applies, and

(ii) such Fund is transferred thereafter, any deduction under this subsection for taxable years ending after the date that such Fund is transferred shall be allowed to the transferor for the taxable year which includes such date.

(D) Special rules

(i) Gain or loss not recognized on transfers to Fund

No gain or loss shall be recognized on any transfer described in paragraph (1).

(ii) Transfers of appreciated property to Fund

If appreciated property is transferred in a transfer described in paragraph (1), the amount of the deduction shall not exceed the adjusted basis of such property.

(3) New ruling amount required

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any transfer unless the taxpayer requests from the Secretary a new schedule of ruling amounts in connection with such transfer.

(4) No basis in qualified funds

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the taxpayer’s basis in any Fund to which this section applies shall not be increased by reason of any transfer permitted by this subsection.
