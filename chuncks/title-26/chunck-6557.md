(2) Coordination with other penalties

(A) Coordination with fraud penalty

This section shall not apply to any portion of an understatement on which a penalty is imposed under section 6663.

(3) Special rule for amended returns

Except as provided in regulations, in no event shall any tax treatment included with an amendment or supplement to a return of tax be taken into account in determining the amount of any reportable transaction understatement if the amendment or supplement is filed after the earlier of the date the taxpayer is first contacted by the Secretary regarding the examination of the return or such other date as is specified by the Secretary.
