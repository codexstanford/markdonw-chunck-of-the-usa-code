(A) a city and 1 contiguous county, or

(B) 2 contiguous counties.

(2) Treatment of certain electric energy transmitted outside local area

(A) In general

A facility shall not be treated as failing to meet the local furnishing requirement of subsection (a)(8) by reason of electricity transmitted pursuant to an order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under section 211 or 213 of the Federal Power Act (as in effect on the date of the enactment of this paragraph) if the portion of the cost of the facility financed with tax-exempt bonds is not greater than the portion of the cost of the facility which is allocable to the local furnishing of electric energy (determined without regard to this paragraph).

(B) Special rule for existing facilities

In the case of a facility financed with bonds issued before the date of an order referred to in subparagraph (A) which would (but for this subparagraph) cease to be tax-exempt by reason of subparagraph (A), such bonds shall not cease to be tax-exempt bonds (and section 150(b)(4) shall not apply) if, to the extent necessary to comply with subparagraph (A)

(i) an escrow to pay principal of, premium (if any), and interest on the bonds is established within a reasonable period after the date such order becomes final, and

(3) Termination of future financing

For purposes of this section, no bond may be issued as part of an issue described in subsection (a)(8) with respect to a facility for the local furnishing of electric energy or gas on or after the date of the enactment of this paragraph unless

(A) the facility will

(i) be used by a person who is engaged in the local furnishing of that energy source on January 1, 1997 , and

(ii) be used to provide service within the area served by such person on January 1, 1997 (or within a county or city any portion of which is within such area), or

(B) the facility will be used by a successor in interest to such person for the same use and within the same service area as described in subparagraph (A).

(4) Election to terminate tax-exempt bond financing by certain furnishers

(A) In general

In the case of a facility financed with bonds issued before the date of the enactment of this paragraph which would cease to be tax-exempt by reason of the failure to meet the local furnishing requirement of subsection (a)(8) as a result of a service area expansion, such bonds shall not cease to be tax-exempt bonds (and section 150(b)(4) shall not apply) if the person engaged in such local furnishing by such facility makes an election described in subparagraph (B).

(B) Election

An election is described in this subparagraph if it is an election made in such manner as the Secretary prescribes, and such person (or its predecessor in interest) agrees that

(i) such election is made with respect to all facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy or gas, or both, by such person,

(ii) no bond exempt from tax under section 103 and described in subsection (a)(8) may be issued on or after the date of the enactment of this paragraph with respect to all such facilities of such person,

(I) is not financed with the proceeds of any exempt facility bond described in subsection (a)(8), and

(II) is not treated as a nonqualifying use under the rules of paragraph (2), and
