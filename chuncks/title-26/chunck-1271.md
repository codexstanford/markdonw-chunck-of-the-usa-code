### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 264. Certain amounts paid in connection with insurance contracts
##### (f) Pro rata allocation of interest expense to policy cash values

(1) In general

No deduction shall be allowed for that portion of the taxpayer’s interest expense which is allocable to unborrowed policy cash values.

(2) Allocation

For purposes of paragraph (1), the portion of the taxpayer’s interest expense which is allocable to unborrowed policy cash values is an amount which bears the same ratio to such interest expense as

(A) the taxpayer’s average unborrowed policy cash values of life insurance policies, and annuity and endowment contracts, issued after June 8, 1997 , bears to

(B) the sum of

(i) in the case of assets of the taxpayer which are life insurance policies or annuity or endowment contracts, the average unborrowed policy cash values of such policies and contracts, and

(ii) in the case of assets of the taxpayer not described in clause (i), the average adjusted bases (within the meaning of section 1016) of such assets.

(3) Unborrowed policy cash value

For purposes of this subsection, the term “unborrowed policy cash value” means, with respect to any life insurance policy or annuity or endowment contract, the excess of

(A) the cash surrender value of such policy or contract determined without regard to any surrender charge, over

(B) the amount of any loan with respect to such policy or contract. If the amount described in subparagraph (A) with respect to any policy or contract does not reasonably approximate its actual value, the amount taken into account under subparagraph (A) shall be the greater of the amount of the insurance company liability or the insurance company reserve with respect to such policy or contract (as determined for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) or shall be such other amount as is determined by the Secretary.

(4) Exception for certain policies and contracts

(A) Policies and contracts covering 20-percent owners, officers, directors, and employees

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any policy or contract owned by an entity engaged in a trade or business if such policy or contract covers only 1 individual and if such individual is (at the time first covered by the policy or contract)

(i) a 20-percent owner of such entity, or

(ii) an individual (not described in clause (i)) who is an officer, director, or employee of such trade or business. A policy or contract covering a 20-percent owner of such entity shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence by reason of covering the joint lives of such owner and such owner’s spouse.

(B) Contracts subject to current income inclusion

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any annuity contract to which section 72(u) applies.

(C) Coordination with paragraph (2)

Any policy or contract to which paragraph (1) does not apply by reason of this paragraph shall not be taken into account under paragraph (2).

(D) 20-percent owner

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “20-percent owner” has the meaning given such term by subsection (e)(4).

(E) Master contracts

If coverage for each insured under a master contract is treated as a separate contract for purposes of sections 817(h), 7702, and 7702A, coverage for each such insured shall be treated as a separate contract for purposes of subparagraph (A). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “master contract” shall not include any group life insurance contract (as defined in section 848(e)(2)).

(5) Exception for policies and contracts held by natural persons; treatment of partnerships and S corporations

(A) Policies and contracts held by natural persons

(i) In general

This subsection shall not apply to any policy or contract held by a natural person.

(ii) Exception where business is beneficiary

If a trade or business is directly or indirectly the beneficiary under any policy or contract, such policy or contract shall be treated as held by such trade or business and not by a natural person.

(iii) Special rules

(I) Certain trades or businesses not taken into account

Clause (ii) shall not apply to any trade or business carried on as a sole proprietorship and to any trade or business performing services as an employee.

(II) Limitation on unborrowed cash value

The amount of the unborrowed cash value of any policy or contract which is taken into account by reason of clause (ii) shall not exceed the benefit to which the trade or business is directly or indirectly entitled under the policy or contract.

(iv) Reporting

The Secretary shall require such reporting from policyholders and issuers as is necessary to carry out clause (ii).

(B) Treatment of partnerships and S corporations

In the case of a partnership or S corporation, this subsection shall be applied at the partnership and corporate levels.

(6) Special rules

(A) Coordination with subsection (a) and section 265

If interest on any indebtedness is disallowed under subsection (a) or section 265

(i) such disallowed interest shall not be taken into account for purposes of applying this subsection, and

(ii) the amount otherwise taken into account under paragraph (2)(B) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of such indebtedness.

(B) Coordination with section 263A

This subsection shall be applied before the application of section 263A (relating to capitalization of certain expenses where taxpayer produces property).

(7) Interest expense

The term “interest expense” means the aggregate amount allowable to the taxpayer as a deduction for interest (within the meaning of section 265(b)(4)) for the taxable year (determined without regard to this subsection, section 265(b), and section 291).

(8) Aggregation rules

(A) In general

All members of a controlled group (within the meaning of subsection (e)(5)(B)) shall be treated as 1 taxpayer for purposes of this subsection.

(B) Treatment of insurance companies

This subsection shall not apply to an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L, and subparagraph (A) shall be applied without regard to any member of an affiliated group which is an insurance company.
