#### § 59A. Tax on base erosion payments of taxpayers with substantial gross receipts
##### (h) Exception for certain payments made in the ordinary course of trade or business

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (3), any qualified derivative payment shall not be treated as a base erosion payment.

(2) Qualified derivative payment

(A) In general

The term “qualified derivative payment” means any payment made by a taxpayer pursuant to a derivative with respect to which the taxpayer

(i) recognizes gain or loss as if such derivative were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year (and such additional times as required by this title or the taxpayer’s method of accounting),

(ii) treats any gain or loss so recognized as ordinary, and

(iii) treats the character of all items of income, deduction, gain, or loss with respect to a payment pursuant to the derivative as ordinary.

(B) Reporting requirement

No payments shall be treated as qualified derivative payments under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year unless the taxpayer includes in the information required to be reported under section 6038B(b)(2) with respect to such taxable year such information as is necessary to identify the payments to be so treated and such other information as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

(3) Exceptions for payments otherwise treated as base erosion payments

This subsection shall not apply to any qualified derivative payment if

(A) the payment would be treated as a base erosion payment if it were not made pursuant to a derivative, including any interest, royalty, or service payment, or

(B) in the case of a contract which has derivative and nonderivative components, the payment is properly allocable to the nonderivative component.

(4) Derivative defined

For purposes of this subsection

(A) In general

The term “derivative” means any contract (including any option, forward contract, futures contract, short position, swap, or similar contract) the value of which, or any payment or other transfer with respect to which, is (directly or indirectly) determined by reference to one or more of the following:

(i) Any share of stock in a corporation.

(ii) Any evidence of indebtedness.

(iii) Any commodity which is actively traded.

(iv) Any currency.

(v) Any rate, price, amount, index, formula, or algorithm. Such term shall not include any item described in clauses (i) through (v).

(B) Treatment of American depository receipts and similar instruments

Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, for purposes of this part, American depository receipts (and similar instruments) with respect to shares of stock in foreign corporations shall be treated as shares of stock in such foreign corporations.

(C) Exception for certain contracts

Such term shall not include any insurance, annuity, or endowment contract issued by an insurance company to which subchapter L applies (or issued by any foreign corporation to which such subchapter would apply if such foreign corporation were a domestic corporation).
