### CHAPTER 78— DISCOVERY OF LIABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF TITLE
#### § 7612. Special procedures for summonses for computer software
##### (b) Circumstances under which computer software source code may be provided

(1) In general

Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to any portion, item, or component of tax-related computer software source code if

(A) the Secretary is unable to otherwise reasonably ascertain the correctness of any item on a return from

(i) the taxpayer’s books, papers, records, or other data; or

(ii) the computer software executable code (and any modifications thereof) to which such source code relates and any associated data which, when executed, produces the output to ascertain the correctness of the item;

(B) the Secretary identifies with reasonable specificity the portion, item, or component of such source code needed to verify the correctness of such item on the return; and

(C) the Secretary determines that the need for the portion, item, or component of such source code with respect to such item outweighs the risks of unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.

(2) Exceptions

Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to

(A) any inquiry into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws;

(B) any tax-related computer software source code acquired or developed by the taxpayer or a related person primarily for internal use by the taxpayer or such person rather than for commercial distribution;

(C) any communications between the owner of the tax-related computer software source code and the taxpayer or related persons; or

(D) any tax-related computer software source code which is required to be provided or made available pursuant to any other provision of this title.

(3) Cooperation required

For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph if

(A) the Secretary determines that it is not feasible to determine the correctness of an item without access to the computer software executable code and associated data described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii);

(B) the Secretary makes a formal request to the taxpayer for such code and data and to the owner of the computer software source code for such executable code; and

(C) such code and data is not provided within 180 days of such request.

(4) Right to contest summons

In any proceeding brought under section 7604 to enforce a summons issued under the authority of this subsection, the court shall, at the request of any party, hold a hearing to determine whether the applicable requirements of this subsection have been met.
