In the case of any taxable year for which an election is made under this paragraph

(B) Amount of reduced credit

The amount of credit determined under this subparagraph for any taxable year shall be the amount equal to the excess of

(I) the amount described in clause (i), and

(II) the maximum rate of tax under section 11(b).
