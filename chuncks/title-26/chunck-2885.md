(2) Deemed paid taxes

In the case of income, war profits, or excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 853 or 960 through a chain of ownership of stock in 1 or more corporations, no credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) for such taxes if

(B) the corporation holding the stock is under an obligation referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii).
