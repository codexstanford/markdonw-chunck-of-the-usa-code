#### § 433. Minimum funding standards for CSEC plans
##### (d) Extension of amortization periods

The period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability (described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B)) of any plan may be extended by the Secretary for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years) if the Secretary determines that such extension would carry out the purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and if the Secretary determines that the failure to permit such extension would result in

(1) a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or

(2) a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation.
