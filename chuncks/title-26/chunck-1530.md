#### § 382. Limitation on net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses following ownership change
##### (h) Special rules for built-in gains and losses and section 338 gains

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

(A) Net unrealized built-in gain

(i) In general

If the old loss corporation has a net unrealized built-in gain, the section 382 limitation for any recognition period taxable year shall be increased by the recognized built-in gains for such taxable year.

(ii) Limitation

The increase under clause (i) for any recognition period taxable year shall not exceed

(I) the net unrealized built-in gain, reduced by

(II) recognized built-in gains for prior years ending in the recognition period.

(B) Net unrealized built-in loss

(i) In general

If the old loss corporation has a net unrealized built-in loss, the recognized built-in loss for any recognition period taxable year shall be subject to limitation under this section in the same manner as if such loss were a pre-change loss.

(ii) Limitation

Clause (i) shall apply to recognized built-in losses for any recognition period taxable year only to the extent such losses do not exceed

(I) the net unrealized built-in loss, reduced by

(II) recognized built-in losses for prior taxable years ending in the recognition period.

(C) Special rules for certain section 338 gains

If an election under section 338 is made in connection with an ownership change and the net unrealized built-in gain is zero by reason of paragraph (3)(B), then, with respect to such change, the section 382 limitation for the post-change year in which gain is recognized by reason of such election shall be increased by the lesser of

(i) the recognized built-in gains by reason of such election, or

(ii) the net unrealized built-in gain (determined without regard to paragraph (3)(B)).

(2) Recognized built-in gain and loss

(A) Recognized built-in gain

The term “recognized built-in gain” means any gain recognized during the recognition period on the disposition of any asset to the extent the new loss corporation establishes that

(i) such asset was held by the old loss corporation immediately before the change date, and

(ii) such gain does not exceed the excess of

(I) the fair market value of such asset on the change date, over

(II) the adjusted basis of such asset on such date.

(B) Recognized built-in loss

The term “recognized built-in loss” means any loss recognized during the recognition period on the disposition of any asset except to the extent the new loss corporation establishes that

(i) such asset was not held by the old loss corporation immediately before the change date, or

(ii) such loss exceeds the excess of

(I) the adjusted basis of such asset on the change date, over

(II) the fair market value of such asset on such date. Such term includes any amount allowable as depreciation, amortization, or depletion for any period within the recognition period except to the extent the new loss corporation establishes that the amount so allowable is not attributable to the excess described in clause (ii).

(3) Net unrealized built-in gain and loss defined

(A) Net unrealized built-in gain and loss

(i) In general

The terms “net unrealized built-in gain” and “net unrealized built-in loss” mean, with respect to any old loss corporation, the amount by which

(I) the fair market value of the assets of such corporation immediately before an ownership change is more or less, respectively, than

(II) the aggregate adjusted basis of such assets at such time.

(ii) Special rule for redemptions or other corporate contractions

If a redemption or other corporate contraction occurs in connection with an ownership change, to the extent provided in regulations, determinations under clause (i) shall be made after taking such redemption or other corporate contraction into account.

(B) Threshold requirement

(i) In general

If the amount of the net unrealized built-in gain or net unrealized built-in loss (determined without regard to this subparagraph) of any old loss corporation is not greater than the lesser of

(I) 15 percent of the amount determined for purposes of subparagraph (A)(i)(I), or

(II) $10,000,000,  the net unrealized built-in gain or net unrealized built-in loss shall be zero.

(ii) Cash and cash items not taken into account

In computing any net unrealized built-in gain or net unrealized built-in loss under clause (i), except as provided in regulations, there shall not be taken into account

(I) any cash or cash item, or

(II) any marketable security which has a value which does not substantially differ from adjusted basis.

(4) Disallowed loss allowed as a carryforward

If a deduction for any portion of a recognized built-in loss is disallowed for any post-change year, such portion

(A) shall be carried forward to subsequent taxable years under rules similar to the rules for the carrying forward of net operating losses (or to the extent the amount so disallowed is attributable to capital losses, under rules similar to the rules for the carrying forward of net capital losses), but

(B) shall be subject to limitation under this section in the same manner as a pre-change loss.

(5) Special rules for post-change year which includes change date

For purposes of subsection (b)(3)

(A) in applying subparagraph (A) thereof, taxable income shall be computed without regard to recognized built-in gains to the extent such gains increased the section 382 limitation for the year (or recognized built-in losses to the extent such losses are treated as pre-change losses), and gain described in paragraph (1)(C), for the year, and

(B) in applying subparagraph (B) thereof, the section 382 limitation shall be computed without regard to recognized built-in gains, and gain described in paragraph (1)(C), for the year.

(6) Treatment of certain built-in items

(A) Income items

Any item of income which is properly taken into account during the recognition period but which is attributable to periods before the change date shall be treated as a recognized built-in gain for the taxable year in which it is properly taken into account.

(B) Deduction items

Any amount which is allowable as a deduction during the recognition period (determined without regard to any carryover) but which is attributable to periods before the change date shall be treated as a recognized built-in loss for the taxable year for which it is allowable as a deduction.

(C) Adjustments

The amount of the net unrealized built-in gain or loss shall be properly adjusted for amounts which would be treated as recognized built-in gains or losses under this paragraph if such amounts were properly taken into account (or allowable as a deduction) during the recognition period.

(7) Recognition period, etc.

(A) Recognition period

The term “recognition period” means, with respect to any ownership change, the 5-year period beginning on the change date.

(B) Recognition period taxable year

The term “recognition period taxable year” means any taxable year any portion of which is in the recognition period.

(8) Determination of fair market value in certain cases

If 80 percent or more in value of the stock of a corporation is acquired in 1 transaction (or in a series of related transactions during any 12-month period), for purposes of determining the net unrealized built-in loss, the fair market value of the assets of such corporation shall not exceed the grossed up amount paid for such stock properly adjusted for indebtedness of the corporation and other relevant items.

(9) Tax-free exchanges or transfers

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection where property held on the change date was acquired (or is subsequently transferred) in a transaction where gain or loss is not recognized (in whole or in part).
