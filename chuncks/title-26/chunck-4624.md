##### (c) Credit where crude oil returned to pipeline

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if an operator of a United States refinery

(1) removes crude oil from a pipeline, and

(2) returns a portion of such crude oil into a stream of other crude oil in the same pipeline, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by section 4611 to such operator an amount equal to the product of the rate of tax imposed by section 4611 on the crude oil so removed by such operator and the number of barrels of crude oil returned by such operator to such pipeline. Any crude oil so returned shall be treated for purposes of this subchapter as crude oil on which no tax has been imposed by section 4611.
