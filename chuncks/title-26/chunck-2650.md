### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 851. Definition of regulated investment company
##### (d) Determination of status

(1) In general

A corporation which meets the requirements of subsections (b)(3) and (c) at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a regulated investment company because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A corporation which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a regulated investment company if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.

(2) Special rules regarding failure to satisfy requirements

If paragraph (1) does not preserve a corporation’s status as a regulated investment company for any particular quarter

(A) In general

A corporation that fails to meet the requirements of subsection (b)(3) (other than a failure described in subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph) for such quarter shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such subsection for such quarter if

(i) following the corporation’s identification of the failure to satisfy the requirements of such subsection for such quarter, a description of each asset that causes the corporation to fail to satisfy the requirements of such subsection at the close of such quarter is set forth in a schedule for such quarter filed in the manner provided by the Secretary,

(ii) the failure to meet the requirements of such subsection for such quarter is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, and

(iii)

(I) the corporation disposes of the assets set forth on the schedule specified in clause (i) within 6 months after the last day of the quarter in which the corporation’s identification of the failure to satisfy the requirements of such subsection occurred or such other time period prescribed by the Secretary and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary, or

(II) the requirements of such subsection are otherwise met within the time period specified in subclause (I).

(B) Rule for certain de minimis failures

A corporation that fails to meet the requirements of subsection (b)(3) for such quarter shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such subsection for such quarter if

(i) such failure is due to the ownership of assets the total value of which does not exceed the lesser of

(I) 1 percent of the total value of the corporation’s assets at the end of the quarter for which such measurement is done, or

(II) $10,000,000, and

(ii)

(I) the corporation, following the identification of such failure, disposes of assets in order to meet the requirements of such subsection within 6 months after the last day of the quarter in which the corporation’s identification of the failure to satisfy the requirements of such subsection occurred or such other time period prescribed by the Secretary and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary, or

(II) the requirements of such subsection are otherwise met within the time period specified in subclause (I).

(C) Tax

(i) Tax imposed

If subparagraph (A) applies to a corporation for any quarter, there is hereby imposed on such corporation a tax in an amount equal to the greater of

(I) $50,000, or

(II) the amount determined (pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary) by multiplying the net income generated by the assets described in the schedule specified in subparagraph (A)(i) for the period specified in clause (ii) by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11.

(ii) Period

For purposes of clause (i)(II), the period described in this clause is the period beginning on the first date that the failure to satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) occurs as a result of the ownership of such assets and ending on the earlier of the date on which the corporation disposes of such assets or the end of the first quarter when there is no longer a failure to satisfy such subsection.

(iii) Administrative provisions

For purposes of subtitle F, a tax imposed by this subparagraph shall be treated as an excise tax with respect to which the deficiency procedures of such subtitle apply.
