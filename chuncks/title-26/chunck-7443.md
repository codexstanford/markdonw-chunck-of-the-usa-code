#### § 7851. Applicability of revenue laws
##### (b) Effect of repeal of Internal Revenue Code of 1939

(1) Existing rights and liabilities

The repeal of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall not affect any act done or any right accruing or accrued, or any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil cause, before such repeal; but all rights and liabilities under such code shall continue, and may be enforced in the same manner, as if such repeal had not been made.

(2) Existing offices

The repeal of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall not abolish, terminate, or otherwise change

(A) any internal revenue district,

(B) any office, position, board, or committee, or

(C) the appointment or employment of any officer or employee, existing immediately preceding the enactment of this title, the continuance of which is not manifestly inconsistent with any provision of this title, but the same shall continue unless and until changed by lawful authority.

(3) Existing delegations of authority

Any delegation of authority made pursuant to the provisions of Reorganization Plan Numbered 26 of 1950 or Reorganization Plan Numbered 1 of 1952, including any redelegation of authority made pursuant to any such delegation of authority, and in effect under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 immediately preceding the enactment of this title shall, notwithstanding the repeal of such code, remain in effect for purposes of this title, unless distinctly inconsistent or manifestly incompatible with the provisions of this title. The preceding sentence shall not be construed as limiting in any manner the power to amend, modify, or revoke any such delegation or redelegation of authority.
