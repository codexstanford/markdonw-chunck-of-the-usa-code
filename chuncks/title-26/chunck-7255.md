##### (c) American Samoa

(1) In general

With respect to calendar year 2021 and each calendar year thereafter, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, make payments to American Samoa equal to

(A) the lesser of

(i) the cost to American Samoa of the earned income tax credit for taxable years beginning in or with such calendar year, or

(ii) $16,000,000, plus

(B) in the case of calendar years 2021 through 2025, the lesser of

(i) the expenditures made by American Samoa during such calendar year for education efforts with respect to individual taxpayers and tax return preparers relating to such earned income tax credit, or

(ii) $50,000.

(2) Requirement to enact and maintain an earned income tax credit

The Secretary shall not make any payments under paragraph (1) with respect to any calendar year unless American Samoa has in effect an earned income tax credit for taxable years beginning in or with such calendar year which allows a refundable tax credit to individuals on the basis of the taxpayer’s earned income which is designed to substantially increase workforce participation.

(3) Inflation adjustment

In the case of any calendar year after 2021, the $16,000,000 amount in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) shall be increased by an amount equal to

(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, determined by substituting “calendar year 2020” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof. Any increase determined under this clause shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100,000.

(4) Application of certain rules

Rules similar to the rules of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subsection (a)(4) shall apply for purposes of this subsection.
