#### § 1503. Computation and payment of tax
##### (d) Dual consolidated loss

(1) In general

The dual consolidated loss for any taxable year of any corporation shall not be allowed to reduce the taxable income of any other member of the affiliated group for the taxable year or any other taxable year.

(2) Dual consolidated loss

For purposes of this section

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “dual consolidated loss” means any net operating loss of a domestic corporation which is subject to an income tax of a foreign country on its income without regard to whether such income is from sources in or outside of such foreign country, or is subject to such a tax on a residence basis.

(B) Special rule where loss not used under foreign law

To the extent provided in regulations, the term “dual consolidated loss” shall not include any loss which, under the foreign income tax law, does not offset the income of any foreign corporation.

(3) Treatment of losses of separate business units

To the extent provided in regulations, any loss of a separate unit of a domestic corporation shall be subject to the limitations of this subsection in the same manner as if such unit were a wholly owned subsidiary of such corporation.

(4) Income on assets acquired after the loss

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subsection by contributing assets to the corporation with the dual consolidated loss after such loss was sustained.
