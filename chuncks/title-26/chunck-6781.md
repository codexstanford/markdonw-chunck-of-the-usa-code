#### § 6867. Presumptions where owner of large amount of cash is not identified
##### (a) General rule

If the individual who is in physical possession of cash in excess of $10,000 does not claim such cash

(1) as his, or

(2) as belonging to another person whose identity the Secretary can readily ascertain and who acknowledges ownership of such cash, then, for purposes of sections 6851 and 6861, it shall be presumed that such cash represents gross income of a single individual for the taxable year in which the possession occurs, and that the collection of tax will be jeopardized by delay.
