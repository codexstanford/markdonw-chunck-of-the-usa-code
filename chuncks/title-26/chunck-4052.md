Solely for purposes of determining whether a transfer of an interest in trust to (or for the benefit of) a member of the transferor’s family is a gift (and the value of such transfer), the value of any interest in such trust retained by the transferor or any applicable family member (as defined in section 2701(e)(2)) shall be determined as provided in paragraph (2).

(2) Valuation of retained interests

(A) In general

The value of any retained interest which is not a qualified interest shall be treated as being zero.

(B) Valuation of qualified interest

The value of any retained interest which is a qualified interest shall be determined under section 7520.

(3) Exceptions

(A) In general

This subsection shall not apply to any transfer

(i) if such transfer is an incomplete gift,

(ii) if such transfer involves the transfer of an interest in trust all the property in which consists of a residence to be used as a personal residence by persons holding term interests in such trust, or

(iii) to the extent that regulations provide that such transfer is not inconsistent with the purposes of this section.
