#### § 2041. Powers of appointment
##### (a) In general

The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property

(1) Powers of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942

To the extent of any property with respect to which a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942 , is exercised by the decedent

(A) by will, or

(B) by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent, such property would be includible in the decedent’s gross estate under sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive; but the failure to exercise such a power or the complete release of such a power shall not be deemed an exercise thereof. If a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942 , has been partially released so that it is no longer a general power of appointment, the exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be the exercise of a general power of appointment if

(i) such partial release occurred before November 1, 1951 , or

(ii) the donee of such power was under a legal disability to release such power on October 21, 1942 , and such partial release occurred not later than 6 months after the termination of such legal disability.

(2) Powers created after October 21, 1942

To the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has at the time of his death a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942 , or with respect to which the decedent has at any time exercised or released such a power of appointment by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent, such property would be includible in the decedent’s gross estate under sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive. For purposes of this paragraph (2), the power of appointment shall be considered to exist on the date of the decedent’s death even though the exercise of the power is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though the exercise of the power takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after its exercise, whether or not on or before the date of the decedent’s death notice has been given or the power has been exercised.

(3) Creation of another power in certain cases

To the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent

(A) by will, or

(B) by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent such property would be includible in the decedent’s gross estate under section 2035, 2036, or 2037, exercises a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942 , by creating another power of appointment which under the applicable local law can be validly exercised so as to postpone the vesting of any estate or interest in such property, or suspend the absolute ownership or power of alienation of such property, for a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the first power.
