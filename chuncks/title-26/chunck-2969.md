(1) Applicable earnings

For purposes of this section, the term “applicable earnings” means, with respect to any controlled foreign corporation, the sum of

(A) the amount (not including a deficit) referred to in section 316(a)(1) to the extent such amount was accumulated in prior taxable years, and

(B) the amount referred to in section 316(a)(2), but reduced by distributions made during the taxable year and by earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1).

(2) Special rule for U.S. property acquired before corporation is a controlled foreign corporation

In applying subsection (a) to any taxable year, there shall be disregarded any item of United States property which was acquired by the controlled foreign corporation before the first day on which such corporation was treated as a controlled foreign corporation. The aggregate amount of property disregarded under the preceding sentence shall not exceed the portion of the applicable earnings of such controlled foreign corporation which were accumulated during periods before such first day.

(3) Special rule where corporation ceases to be controlled foreign corporation

If any foreign corporation ceases to be a controlled foreign corporation during any taxable year

(B) the average referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) for such taxable year shall be determined by only taking into account quarters ending on or before such last day, and

(C) in determining applicable earnings, the amount taken into account by reason of being described in paragraph (2) of section 316(a) shall be the portion of the amount so described which is allocable (on a pro rata basis) to the part of such year during which the corporation is a controlled foreign corporation.
