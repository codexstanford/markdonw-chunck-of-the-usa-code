For purposes of this subpart

(1) Unemployment insurance wages

(A) Agricultural labor

If the services performed by any employee for an employer during more than one-half of any pay period (within the meaning of section 3306(d)) taken into account with respect to any year constitute agricultural labor (within the meaning of section 3306(k)), the term “unemployment insurance wages” means, with respect to the remuneration paid by the employer to such employee for such year, an amount equal to so much of such remuneration as constitutes “wages” within the meaning of section 3121(a), except that the contribution and benefit base for each calendar year shall be deemed to be $6,000.

(B) Railway labor

If more than one-half of remuneration paid by an employer to an employee during any year is remuneration for service described in section 3306(c)(9), the term “unemployment insurance wages” means, with respect to such employee for such year, an amount equal to so much of the remuneration paid to such employee during such year which would be subject to contributions under section 8(a) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act ( 45 U.S.C. 358(a) ) if the maximum amount subject to such contributions were $500 per month.

(2) Wages

In any case to which subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) applies, the term “wages” means unemployment insurance wages (determined without regard to any dollar limitation).
