#### § 7448. Annuities to surviving spouses and dependent children of judges and special trial judges
##### (h) Entitlement to annuity

In case any judge or special trial judge electing under subsection (b) shall die while a judge or special trial judge after having rendered at least 5 years of civilian service computed as prescribed in subsection (n), for the last 5 years of which the salary deductions provided for by subsection (c)(1) or the deposits required by subsection (d) have actually been made or the salary deductions required by the civil service retirement laws have actually been made

(1) if such judge or special trial judge is survived by a surviving spouse but not by a dependent child, there shall be paid to such surviving spouse an annuity beginning with the day of the death of the judge or special trial judge or following the surviving spouse’s attainment of the age of 50 years, whichever is the later, in an amount computed as provided in subsection (m); or

(2) if such judge or special trial judge is survived by a surviving spouse and a dependent child or children, there shall be paid to such surviving spouse an immediate annuity in an amount computed as provided in subsection (m), and there shall also be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the lesser of

(A) 10 percent of the average annual salary of such judge or special trial judge (determined in accordance with subsection (m)), or

(B) 20 percent of such average annual salary, divided by the number of such children; or

(3) if such judge or special trial judge leaves no surviving spouse but leaves a surviving dependent child or children, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the lesser of

(A) 20 percent of the average annual salary of such judge or special trial judge (determined in accordance with subsection (m)), or

(B) 40 percent of such average annual salary, divided by the number of such children. The annuity payable to a surviving spouse under this subsection shall be terminable upon such surviving spouse’s death or such surviving spouse’s remarriage before attaining age 55. The annuity payable to a child under this subsection shall be terminable upon (A) his attaining the age of 18 years, (B) his marriage, or (C) his death, whichever first occurs, except that if such child is incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability his annuity shall be terminable only upon death, marriage, or recovery from such disability. In case of the death of a surviving spouse of a judge or special trial judge leaving a dependent child or children of the judge or special trial judge surviving such spouse, the annuity of such child or children shall be recomputed and paid as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection. In any case in which the annuity of a dependent child is terminated under this subsection, the annuities of any remaining dependent child or children, based upon the service of the same judge or special trial judge, shall be recomputed and paid as though the child whose annuity was so terminated had not survived such judge or special trial judge.
