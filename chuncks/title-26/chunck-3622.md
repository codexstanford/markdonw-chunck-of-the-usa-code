### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 1392. Eligibility criteria
##### (b) Special rules relating to determination of poverty rate

For purposes of subsection (a)(4)

(1) Treatment of census tracts with small populations

(A) Tracts with no population

In the case of a population census tract with no population

(i) such tract shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(4), but

(ii) such tract shall be treated as having a zero poverty rate for purposes of applying subparagraph (C) thereof.

(B) Tracts with populations of less than 2,000

A population census tract with a population of less than 2,000 shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(4) if more than 75 percent of such tract is zoned for commercial or industrial use.

(2) Discretion to adjust requirements for enterprise communities

In determining whether a nominated area is eligible for designation as an enterprise community, the appropriate Secretary may, where necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, reduce by 5 percentage points one of the following thresholds for not more than 10 percent of the population census tracts (or, if fewer, 5 population census tracts) in the nominated area:

(A) The 20 percent threshold in subsection (a)(4)(A).

(B) The 25 percent threshold in subsection (a)(4)(B).

(C) The 35 percent threshold in subsection (a)(4)(C). If the appropriate Secretary elects to reduce the threshold under subparagraph (C), such Secretary may (in lieu of applying the preceding sentence) reduce by 10 percentage points the threshold under subparagraph (C) for 3 population census tracts.

(3) Each noncontiguous area must satisfy poverty rate rule

A nominated area may not include a noncontiguous parcel unless such parcel separately meets (subject to paragraphs (1) and (2)) the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(4).

(4) Areas not within census tracts

In the case of an area which is not tracted for population census tracts, the equivalent county divisions (as defined by the Bureau of the Census for purposes of defining poverty areas) shall be used for purposes of determining poverty rates.
