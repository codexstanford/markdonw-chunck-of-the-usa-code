Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), each individual who was an eligible individual for such individual’s first taxable year beginning in 2019 shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such taxable year in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for such taxable year.

(2) Advance refund amount

For purposes of paragraph (1), the advance refund amount is the amount that would have been allowed as a credit under this section for such taxable year if this section (other than subsection (f) and this subsection) had applied to such taxable year.

(B) Treatment of deceased individuals

For purposes of determining the advance refund amount with respect to such taxable year

(i) any individual who was deceased before January 1, 2021 , shall be treated for purposes of applying subsection (e)(2) in the same manner as if the valid identification number of such person was not included on the return of tax for such taxable year (except that subparagraph (E) thereof shall not apply),

(ii) notwithstanding clause (i), in the case of a joint return with respect to which only 1 spouse is deceased before January 1, 2021 , such deceased spouse was a member of the Armed Forces of the United States at any time during the taxable year, and the valid identification number of such deceased spouse is included on the return of tax for the taxable year, the valid identification number of 1 (and only 1) spouse shall be treated as included on the return of tax for the taxable year for purposes of applying subsection (e)(2)(B) with respect to such joint return, and

The Secretary shall, subject to the provisions of this title and consistent with rules similar to the rules of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 6428A(f)(3), refund or credit any overpayment attributable to this subsection as rapidly as possible, consistent with a rapid effort to make payments attributable to such overpayments electronically if appropriate.

(4) No interest

No interest shall be allowed on any overpayment attributable to this subsection.

(5) Application to individuals who have filed a return of tax for 2020

(A) Application to 2020 returns filed at time of initial determination

If, at the time of any determination made pursuant to paragraph (3), the individual referred to in paragraph (1) has filed a return of tax for the individual’s first taxable year beginning in 2020, paragraph (1) shall be applied with respect to such individual by substituting “2020” for “2019”.

(B) Additional payment

(i) In general

In the case of any individual who files, before the additional payment determination date, a return of tax for such individual’s first taxable year beginning in 2020, the Secretary shall make a payment (in addition to any payment made under paragraph (1)) to such individual equal to the excess (if any) of

(I) the amount which would be determined under paragraph (1) (after the application of subparagraph (A)) by applying paragraph (1) as of the additional payment determination date, over

(II) the amount of any payment made with respect to such individual under paragraph (1).

(ii) Additional payment determination date

The term “additional payment determination date” means the earlier of

(I) the date which is 90 days after the 2020 calendar year filing deadline, or

(II) September 1, 2021 .

(iii) 2020 calendar year filing deadline

The term “2020 calendar year filing deadline” means the date specified in section 6072(a) with respect to returns for calendar year 2020. Such date shall be determined after taking into account any period disregarded under section 7508A if such disregard applies to substantially all returns for calendar year 2020 to which section 6072(a) applies.

(6) Application to certain individuals who have not filed a return of tax for 2019 or 2020 at time of determination

In the case of any individual who, at the time of any determination made pursuant to paragraph (3), has filed a tax return for neither the year described in paragraph (1) nor for the year described in paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall, consistent with rules similar to the rules of section 6428A(f)(5)(H)(i), apply paragraph (1) on the basis of information available to the Secretary and shall, on the basis of such information, determine the advance refund amount with respect to such individual without regard to subsection (d) unless the Secretary has reason to know that such amount would otherwise be reduced by reason of such subsection.

(7) Special rule related to time of filing return

Solely for purposes of this subsection, a return of tax shall not be treated as filed until such return has been processed by the Internal Revenue Service.

(8) Restriction on use of certain previously issued prepaid debit cards

Payments made by the Secretary to individuals under this section shall not be in the form of an increase in the balance of any previously issued prepaid debit card if, as of the time of the issuance of such card, such card was issued solely for purposes of making payments under section 6428 or 6428A.
