(F) the total contract price does not substantially exceed the rental value of the property for the contract period.

(2) Other arrangements

An arrangement (including a partnership or other pass-thru entity) which is not described in paragraph (1) shall be treated as a lease if such arrangement is properly treated as a lease, taking into account all relevant factors including factors similar to those set forth in paragraph (1).

(3) Special rules for contracts or arrangements involving solid waste disposal, energy, and clean water facilities

(A) In general

Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), and except as provided in paragraph (4), any contract or arrangement between a service provider and a service recipient

(i) with respect to

(I) the operation of a qualified solid waste disposal facility,

(II) the sale to the service recipient of electrical or thermal energy produced at a cogeneration or alternative energy facility,

(III) the operation of a water treatment works facility, or

(IV) the operation of a storage facility, and

(ii) which purports to be a service contract, shall be treated as a service contract.

(B) Qualified solid waste disposal facility

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “qualified solid waste disposal facility” means any facility if such facility provides solid waste disposal services for residents of part or all of 1 or more governmental units and substantially all of the solid waste processed at such facility is collected from the general public.

(C) Cogeneration facility

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “cogeneration facility” means a facility which uses the same energy source for the sequential generation of electrical or mechanical power in combination with steam, heat, or other forms of useful energy.

(D) Alternative energy facility

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “alternative energy facility” means a facility for producing electrical or thermal energy if the primary energy source for the facility is not oil, natural gas, coal, or nuclear power.

(E) Water treatment works facility

(F) Storage facility

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “storage facility” means a facility which uses energy storage technology within the meaning of section 48(c)(6).

(4) Paragraph (3) not to apply in certain cases

(A) In general

Paragraph (3) shall not apply to any qualified solid waste disposal facility, cogeneration facility, alternative energy facility, water treatment works facility, or storage facility used under a contract or arrangement if

(i) the service recipient (or a related entity) operates such facility,

(ii) the service recipient (or a related entity) bears any significant financial burden if there is nonperformance under the contract or arrangement (other than for reasons beyond the control of the service provider),

(iii) the service recipient (or a related entity) receives any significant financial benefit if the operating costs of such facility are less than the standards of performance or operation under the contract or arrangement, or

(iv) the service recipient (or a related entity) has an option to purchase, or may be required to purchase, all or a part of such facility at a fixed and determinable price (other than for fair market value). For purposes of this paragraph, the term “related entity” has the same meaning as when used in section 168(h).

(B) Special rules for application of subparagraph (A) with respect to certain rights and allocations under the contract

For purposes of subparagraph (A), there shall not be taken into account

(i) any right of a service recipient to inspect any facility, to exercise any sovereign power the service recipient may possess, or to act in the event of a breach of contract by the service provider, or

(ii) any allocation of any financial burden or benefits in the event of any change in any law.

(C) Special rules for application of subparagraph (A) in the case of certain events

(i) Temporary shut-downs, etc.

For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), there shall not be taken into account any temporary shut-down of the facility for repairs, maintenance, or capital improvements, or any financial burden caused by the bankruptcy or similar financial difficulty of the service provider.

(ii) Reduced costs

For purposes of clause (iii) of subparagraph (A), there shall not be taken into account any significant financial benefit merely because payments by the service recipient under the contract or arrangement are decreased by reason of increased production or efficiency or the recovery of energy or other products.
