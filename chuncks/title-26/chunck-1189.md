##### (j) Determination of whether numerical limits are exceeded

(1) Determination of whether limit exceeded for 1997

The numerical limitation for 1997 is exceeded if, based on the reports required under paragraph (4), the number of Archer MSAs established as of

(A) April 30, 1997 , exceeds 375,000, or

(B) June 30, 1997 , exceeds 525,000.

(2) Determination of whether limit exceeded for 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, or 2006

(A) In general

The numerical limitation for 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, or 2006 is exceeded if the sum of

(i) the number of MSA returns filed on or before April 15 of such calendar year for taxable years ending with or within the preceding calendar year, plus

(ii) the Secretary’s estimate (determined on the basis of the returns described in clause (i)) of the number of MSA returns for such taxable years which will be filed after such date, exceeds 750,000 (600,000 in the case of 1998). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “MSA return” means any return on which any exclusion is claimed under section 106(b) or any deduction is claimed under this section.

(i) 90 percent of the sum determined under subparagraph (A) for such calendar year, plus

(ii) the product of 2.5 and the number of Archer MSAs established during the portion of such year preceding July 1 (based on the reports required under paragraph (4)) for taxable years beginning in such year, exceeds 750,000.

(C) No limitation for 2000 or 2003

The numerical limitation shall not apply for 2000 or 2003.

(3) Previously uninsured individuals not included in determination

(A) In general

The determination of whether any calendar year is a cut-off year shall be made by not counting the Archer MSA of any previously uninsured individual.

(B) Previously uninsured individual

For purposes of this subsection, the term “previously uninsured individual” means, with respect to any Archer MSA, any individual who had no health plan coverage (other than coverage referred to in subsection (c)(1)(B)) at any time during the 6-month period before the date such individual’s coverage under the high deductible health plan commences.

(4) Reporting by MSA trustees

(A) In general

(i) the number of Archer MSAs established before such July 1 (for taxable years beginning in such calendar year) of which such person is the trustee,

(ii) the name and TIN of the account holder of each such account, and

(iii) the number of such accounts which are accounts of previously uninsured individuals.

(B) Additional report for 1997

Not later than June 1, 1997 , each person who is the trustee of an Archer MSA established before May 1, 1997 , shall make an additional report described in subparagraph (A) but only with respect to accounts established before May 1, 1997 .

(C) Penalty for failure to file report

The penalty provided in section 6693(a) shall apply to any report required by this paragraph, except that

(ii) the maximum penalty imposed on any trustee shall not exceed $5,000.

(D) Aggregation of accounts

To the extent practicable, in determining the number of Archer MSAs on the basis of the reports under this paragraph, all Archer MSAs of an individual shall be treated as 1 account and all accounts of individuals who are married to each other shall be treated as 1 account.

(5) Date of making determinations

Any determination under this subsection that a calendar year is a cut-off year shall be made by the Secretary and shall be published not later than October 1 of such year.
