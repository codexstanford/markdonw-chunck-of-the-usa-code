#### § 614. Definition of property
##### (e) Special rule as to nonoperating mineral interests

(1) Aggregation of separate interests

If a taxpayer owns two or more separate nonoperating mineral interests in a single tract or parcel of land or in two or more adjacent tracts or parcels of land, the Secretary shall, on showing by the taxpayer that a principal purpose is not the avoidance of tax, permit the taxpayer to treat (for all purposes of this subtitle) all such mineral interests in each separate kind of mineral deposit as one property. If such permission is granted for any taxable year, the taxpayer shall treat such interests as one property for all subsequent taxable years unless the Secretary consents to a different treatment.

(2) Nonoperating mineral interests defined

For purposes of this subsection, the term “nonoperating mineral interests” includes only interests which are not operating mineral interests.
