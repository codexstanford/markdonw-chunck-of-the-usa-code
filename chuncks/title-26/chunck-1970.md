If

(A) the lessor under any section 467 rental agreement disposes of any property subject to such agreement during the term of such agreement, and

The amount determined under subparagraph (B) shall be reduced by the amount of any gain treated as ordinary income on the disposition under any other provision of this subtitle.

(3) Prior understated inclusions

For purposes of this subsection, the term “prior understated inclusion” means the excess (if any) of

(A) the amount which would have been taken into account by the lessor under subsection (a) for periods before the disposition if subsection (b)(2) had applied to the agreement, over
