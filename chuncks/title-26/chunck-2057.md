A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of this subparagraph merely because the benefits received under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation, or the basic or regular rate of compensation, of the employees covered by the plan, and

(D) in the case of a plan under which an employee may designate certain contributions as deductible

(i) such contributions do not exceed the amount with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 219(b)(3),

(iii) such contributions are treated as elective deferrals for purposes of section 402(g), and

(iv) the requirements of section 401(a)(30) are met. For purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), rules similar to the rules of section 401(k)(8) shall apply. For purposes of section 4979, any excess contribution under clause (ii) shall be treated as an excess contribution under a cash or deferred arrangement.
