#### § 45R. Employee health insurance expenses of small employers
##### (g) Application of section for calendar years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013

In the case of any taxable year beginning in 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013, the following modifications to this section shall apply in determining the amount of the credit under subsection (a):

(1) No credit period required

The credit shall be determined without regard to whether the taxable year is in a credit period and for purposes of applying this section to taxable years beginning after 2013, no credit period shall be treated as beginning with a taxable year beginning before 2014.

(2) Amount of credit

The amount of the credit determined under subsection (b) shall be determined

(A) by substituting “35 percent (25 percent in the case of a tax-exempt eligible small employer)” for “50 percent (35 percent in the case of a tax-exempt eligible small employer)”,

(B) by reference to an eligible small employer’s nonelective contributions for premiums paid for health insurance coverage (within the meaning of section 9832(b)(1)) of an employee, and

(C) by substituting for the average premium determined under subsection (b)(2) the amount the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines is the average premium for the small group market in the State in which the employer is offering health insurance coverage (or for such area within the State as is specified by the Secretary).

(3) Contribution arrangement

An arrangement shall not fail to meet the requirements of subsection (d)(4) solely because it provides for the offering of insurance outside of an Exchange.
