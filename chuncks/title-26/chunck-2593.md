(D) the difference between the fair market value and adjusted basis referred to in paragraph (1) shall be reduced (to not less than zero) by the excess of (i) the gain that would have been recognized but for this subsection on all prior sales or dispositions after December 31, 1958 , of properties referred to in subparagraph (C), over (ii) the gain which was recognized on such sales or other dispositions, and
