#### § 857. Taxation of real estate investment trusts and their beneficiaries
##### (d) Earnings and profits

(1) In general

The earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust for any taxable year (but not its accumulated earnings) shall not be reduced by any amount which

(A) is not allowable in computing its taxable income for such taxable year, and

(B) was not allowable in computing its taxable income for any prior taxable year.

(2) Coordination with tax on undistributed income

A real estate investment trust shall be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution (other than in a redemption to which section 302(a) applies) which is treated as a dividend by such trust. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the amount distributed during any calendar year by the trust exceeds the required distribution for such calendar year (as determined under section 4981).

(3) Distributions to meet requirements of subsection (a)(2)(B)

Any distribution which is made in order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(2)(B)

(A) shall be treated for purposes of this subsection and subsection (a)(2)(B) as made from earnings and profits which, but for the distribution, would result in a failure to meet such requirements (and allocated to such earnings on a first-in, first-out basis), and

(B) to the extent treated under subparagraph (A) as made from accumulated earnings and profits, shall not be treated as a distribution for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B) and section 858.

(4) Real estate investment trust

For purposes of this subsection, the term “real estate investment trust” includes a domestic corporation, trust, or association which is a real estate investment trust determined without regard to the requirements of subsection (a).

(5) Special rules for determining earnings and profits for purposes of the deduction for dividends paid

For special rules for determining the earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust for purposes of the deduction for dividends paid, see section 562(e)(1).
