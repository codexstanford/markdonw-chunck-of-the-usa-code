(1) In general

In the case of a taxpayer which elects (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may provide) the application of this subsection with respect to any qualified building, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year which includes the date of the qualifying final certification with respect to the qualified retrofit plan of such building, an amount equal to the lesser of

(A) the excess described in subsection (b) (determined by substituting “energy use intensity” for “total annual energy and power costs” in paragraph (2) thereof), or

(B) the aggregate adjusted basis (determined after taking into account all adjustments with respect to such taxable year other than the reduction under subsection (e)) of energy efficient building retrofit property placed in service by the taxpayer pursuant to such qualified retrofit plan.

(2) Qualified retrofit plan

For purposes of this subsection, the term “qualified retrofit plan” means a written plan prepared by a qualified professional which specifies modifications to a building which, in the aggregate, are expected to reduce such building’s energy use intensity by 25 percent or more in comparison to the baseline energy use intensity of such building. Such plan shall provide for a qualified professional to

(A) as of any date during the 1-year period ending on the date on which the property installed pursuant to such plan is placed in service, certify the energy use intensity of such building as of such date,

(B) certify the status of property installed pursuant to such plan as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3), and

(C) as of any date that is more than 1 year after the date on which the property installed pursuant to such plan is placed in service, certify the energy use intensity of such building as of such date.

(6) Baseline energy use intensity

(A) In general

For purposes of this subsection, the term “baseline energy use intensity” means the energy use intensity certified under paragraph (2)(A), as adjusted to take into account weather.

(B) Determination of adjustment

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the adjustments described in such subparagraph shall be determined in such manner as the Secretary may provide.

(7) Other definitions

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Energy use intensity

The term “energy use intensity” means the annualized, measured site energy use intensity determined in accordance with such regulations or other guidance as the Secretary may provide and measured in British thermal units.

(B) Qualified professional

The term “qualified professional” means an individual who is a licensed architect or a licensed engineer and meets such other requirements as the Secretary may provide.

(8) Coordination with deduction otherwise allowed under subsection (a)

(A) In general

In the case of any building with respect to which an election is made under paragraph (1), the term “energy efficient commercial building property” shall not include any energy efficient building retrofit property with respect to which a deduction is allowable under this subsection.
