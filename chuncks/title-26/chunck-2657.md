### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 852. Taxation of regulated investment companies and their shareholders
##### (b) Method of taxation of companies and shareholders

(1) Imposition of tax on regulated investment companies

There is hereby imposed for each taxable year upon the investment company taxable income of every regulated investment company a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.

(2) Investment company taxable income

The investment company taxable income shall be the taxable income of the regulated investment company adjusted as follows:

(A) There shall be excluded the amount of the net capital gain, if any.

(B) The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.

(C) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) in subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.

(D) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends.

(E) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).

(F) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount basis) if the company so elects in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.

(G) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by subsections (d)(2) and (i) of section 851 for the taxable year.

(3) Capital gains

(A) Imposition of tax

There is hereby imposed for each taxable year in the case of every regulated investment company a tax, determined as provided in section 11(b), on the excess, if any, of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only.

(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders

A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.

(C) Definition of capital gain dividend

For purposes of this part

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is reported by the company as a capital gain dividend in written statements furnished to its shareholders.

(ii) Excess reported amounts

If the aggregate reported amount with respect to the company for any taxable year exceeds the net capital gain of the company for such taxable year, a capital gain dividend is the excess of

(I) the reported capital gain dividend amount, over

(II) the excess reported amount which is allocable to such reported capital gain dividend amount.

(iii) Allocation of excess reported amount

(I) In general

Except as provided in subclause (II), the excess reported amount (if any) which is allocable to the reported capital gain dividend amount is that portion of the excess reported amount which bears the same ratio to the excess reported amount as the reported capital gain dividend amount bears to the aggregate reported amount.

(II) Special rule for noncalendar year taxpayers

In the case of any taxable year which does not begin and end in the same calendar year, if the post-December reported amount equals or exceeds the excess reported amount for such taxable year, subclause (I) shall be applied by substituting “post-December reported amount” for “aggregate reported amount” and no excess reported amount shall be allocated to any dividend paid on or before December 31 of such taxable year.

(iv) Definitions

For purposes of this subparagraph

(I) Reported capital gain dividend amount

The term “reported capital gain dividend amount” means the amount reported to its shareholders under clause (i) as a capital gain dividend.

(II) Excess reported amount

The term “excess reported amount” means the excess of the aggregate reported amount over the net capital gain of the company for the taxable year.

(III) Aggregate reported amount

The term “aggregate reported amount” means the aggregate amount of dividends reported by the company under clause (i) as capital gain dividends for the taxable year (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 855).

(IV) Post-December reported amount

The term “post-December reported amount” means the aggregate reported amount determined by taking into account only dividends paid after December 31 of the taxable year.

(v) Adjustment for determinations

If there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A) for the taxable year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), the company may, subject to the limitations of this subparagraph, increase the amount of capital gain dividends reported under clause (i).

(vi) Special rule for losses late in the calendar year

For special rule for certain losses after October 31, see paragraph (8).

(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains

(i) Every shareholder of a regulated investment company at the close of the company’s taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the company’s taxable year falls, such amount as the company shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after close of its taxable year, but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the company to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.

(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholder shall be allowed credit or refund, as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.

(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the shareholder shall be increased, with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).

(iv) In the event of such designation the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) shall be paid by the regulated investment company within 30 days after close of its taxable year.

(v) The earnings and profits of such regulated investment company, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

(E) Certain distributions

In the case of a distribution to which section 897 does not apply by reason of the second sentence of section 897(h)(1), the amount of such distribution which would be included in computing long-term capital gains for the shareholder under subparagraph (B) or (D) (without regard to this subparagraph)

(i) shall not be included in computing such shareholder’s long-term capital gains, and

(ii) shall be included in such shareholder’s gross income as a dividend from the regulated investment company.

(4) Loss on sale or exchange of stock held 6 months or less

(A) Loss attributable to capital gain dividend

If

(i) subparagraph (B) or (D) of paragraph (3) provides that any amount with respect to any share is to be treated as long-term capital gain, and

(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less, then any loss (to the extent not disallowed under subparagraph (B)) on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount described in clause (i), be treated as a long-term capital loss.

(B) Loss attributable to exempt-interest dividend

If

(i) a shareholder of a regulated investment company receives an exempt-interest dividend with respect to any share, and

(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less, then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount of such exempt-interest dividend, be disallowed.

(C) Determination of holding periods

For purposes of this paragraph, in determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock

(i) the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 246(c) shall apply, and

(ii) there shall not be taken into account any day which is more than 6 months after the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend.

(D) Losses incurred under a periodic liquidation plan

To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to losses incurred on the sale or exchange of shares of stock in a regulated investment company pursuant to a plan which provides for the periodic liquidation of such shares.

(E) Exception to holding period requirement for certain regularly declared exempt-interest dividends

(i) Daily dividend companies

Except as otherwise provided by regulations, subparagraph (B) shall not apply with respect to a regular dividend paid by a regulated investment company which declares exempt-interest dividends on a daily basis in an amount equal to at least 90 percent of its net tax-exempt interest and distributes such dividends on a monthly or more frequent basis.

(ii) Authority to shorten required holding period with respect to other companies

In the case of a regulated investment company (other than a company described in clause (i)) which regularly distributes at least 90 percent of its net tax-exempt interest, the Secretary may by regulations prescribe that subparagraph (B) (and subparagraph (C) to the extent it relates to subparagraph (B)) shall be applied on the basis of a holding period requirement shorter than 6 months; except that such shorter holding period requirement shall not be shorter than the greater of 31 days or the period between regular distributions of exempt-interest dividends.

(5) Exempt-interest dividends

If, at the close of each quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the value (as defined in section 851(c)(4)) of the total assets of the regulated investment company consists of obligations described in section 103(a), such company shall be qualified to pay exempt-interest dividends, as defined herein, to its shareholders.

(iii) Allocation of excess reported amount

(I) In general

(II) Special rule for noncalendar year taxpayers

In the case of any taxable year which does not begin and end in the same calendar year, if the post-December reported amount equals or exceeds the excess reported amount for such taxable year, subclause (I) shall be applied by substituting “post-December reported amount” for “aggregate reported amount” and no excess reported amount shall be allocated to any dividend paid on or before December 31 of such taxable year.
