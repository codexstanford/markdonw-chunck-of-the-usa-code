(D) Any obligation to pay rents from real property (as defined in subsection (d)(1)).

(E) Any security issued by a State or any political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but only if the determination of any payment received or accrued under such security does not depend in whole or in part on the profits of any entity not described in this subparagraph or payments on any obligation issued by such an entity,

(F) Any security issued by a real estate investment trust.

(G) Any other arrangement as determined by the Secretary.

(2) Special rules relating to straight debt securities

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), securities meet the requirements of this paragraph if such securities are straight debt, as defined in section 1361(c)(5) (without regard to subparagraph (B)(iii) thereof).

(B) Special rules relating to certain contingencies

For purposes of subparagraph (A), any interest or principal shall not be treated as failing to satisfy section 1361(c)(5)(B)(i) solely by reason of the fact that

(i) the time of payment of such interest or principal is subject to a contingency, but only if

(I) any such contingency does not have the effect of changing the effective yield to maturity, as determined under section 1272, other than a change in the annual yield to maturity which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 percent or 5 percent of the annual yield to maturity, or

(II) neither the aggregate issue price nor the aggregate face amount of the issuer’s debt instruments held by the trust exceeds $1,000,000 and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid thereunder, or

(ii) the time or amount of payment is subject to a contingency upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt, but only if such contingency is consistent with customary commercial practice.

(C) Special rules relating to corporate or partnership issuers

In the case of an issuer which is a corporation or a partnership, securities that otherwise would be described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be considered not to be so described if the trust holding such securities and any of its controlled taxable REIT subsidiaries (as defined in subsection (d)(8)(A)(iv)) hold any securities of the issuer which

(i) are not described in paragraph (1) (prior to the application of this subparagraph), and

(ii) have an aggregate value greater than 1 percent of the issuer’s outstanding securities determined without regard to paragraph (3)(A)(i).

(3) Look-through rule for partnership securities

(A) In general

For purposes of applying subclause (III) of subsection (c)(4)(B)(iv)

(i) a trust’s interest as a partner in a partnership (as defined in section 7701(a)(2)) shall not be considered a security, and

(ii) the trust shall be deemed to own its proportionate share of each of the assets of the partnership.

(B) Determination of trust’s interest in partnership assets

For purposes of subparagraph (A), with respect to any taxable year beginning after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph

(i) the trust’s interest in the partnership assets shall be the trust’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership (determined without regard to subparagraph (A)(i) and paragraph (4), but not including securities described in paragraph (1)), and

(ii) the value of any debt instrument shall be the adjusted issue price thereof, as defined in section 1272(a)(4).

(4) Certain partnership debt instruments not treated as a security

For purposes of applying subclause (III) of subsection (c)(4)(B)(iv)

(A) any debt instrument issued by a partnership and not described in paragraph (1) shall not be considered a security to the extent of the trust’s interest as a partner in the partnership, and

(B) any debt instrument issued by a partnership and not described in paragraph (1) shall not be considered a security if at least 75 percent of the partnership’s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) is derived from sources referred to in subsection (c)(3).

(5) Secretarial guidance

The Secretary is authorized to provide guidance (including through the issuance of a written determination, as defined in section 6110(b)) that an arrangement shall not be considered a security held by the trust for purposes of applying subclause (III) of subsection (c)(4)(B)(iv) notwithstanding that such arrangement otherwise could be considered a security under subparagraph (F) of subsection (c)(5).
