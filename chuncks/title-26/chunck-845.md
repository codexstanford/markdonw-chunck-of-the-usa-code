#### § 143. Mortgage revenue bonds: qualified mortgage bond and qualified veterans’ mortgage bond
##### (g) Requirements related to arbitrage

(1) In general

An issue meets the requirements of this subsection only if such issue meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection and, in the case of an issue described in subsection (b)(1), such issue also meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of this subsection. Such requirements shall be in addition to the requirements of section 148.

(2) Effective rate of mortgage interest cannot exceed bond yield by more than 1.125 percentage points

(A) In general

An issue shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph only if the excess of

(i) the effective rate of interest on the mortgages provided under the issue, over

(ii) the yield on the issue, is not greater than 1.125 percentage points.

(B) Effective rate of mortgage interest

(i) In general

In determining the effective rate of interest on any mortgage for purposes of this paragraph, there shall be taken into account all fees, charges, and other amounts borne by the mortgagor which are attributable to the mortgage or to the bond issue.

(ii) Specification of some of the amounts to be treated as borne by the mortgagor

For purposes of clause (i), the following items (among others) shall be treated as borne by the mortgagor:

(I) all points or similar charges paid by the seller of the property, and

(II) the excess of the amounts received from any person other than the mortgagor by any person in connection with the acquisition of the mortgagor’s interest in the property over the usual and reasonable acquisition costs of a person acquiring like property where owner-financing is not provided through the use of qualified mortgage bonds or qualified veterans’ mortgage bonds.

(iii) Specification of some of the amounts to be treated as not borne by the mortgagor

For purposes of clause (i), the following items shall not be taken into account:

(I) any expected rebate of arbitrage profits, and

(II) any application fee, survey fee, credit report fee, insurance charge, or similar amount to the extent such amount does not exceed amounts charged in such area in cases where owner-financing is not provided through the use of qualified mortgage bonds or qualified veterans’ mortgage bonds.  Subclause (II) shall not apply to origination fees, points, or similar amounts.

(iv) Prepayment assumptions

In determining the effective rate of interest

(I) it shall be assumed that the mortgage prepayment rate will be the rate set forth in the most recent applicable mortgage maturity experience table published by the Federal Housing Administration, and

(II) prepayments of principal shall be treated as received on the last day of the month in which the issuer reasonably expects to receive such prepayments.  The Secretary may by regulation adjust the mortgage prepayment rate otherwise used in determining the effective rate of interest to the extent the Secretary determines that such an adjustment is appropriate by reason of the impact of subsection (m).

(C) Yield on the issue

For purposes of this subsection, the yield on an issue shall be determined on the basis of

(i) the issue price (within the meaning of sections 1273 and 1274), and

(ii) an expected maturity for the bonds which is consistent with the assumptions required under subparagraph (B)(iv).

(3) Arbitrage and investment gains to be used to reduce costs of owner-financing

(A) In general

An issue shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph only if an amount equal to the sum of

(i) the excess of

(I) the amount earned on all nonpurpose investments (other than investments attributable to an excess described in this clause), over

(II) the amount which would have been earned if such investments were invested at a rate equal to the yield on the issue, plus

(ii) any income attributable to the excess described in clause (i), is paid or credited to the mortgagors as rapidly as may be practicable.

(B) Investment gains and losses

For purposes of subparagraph (A), in determining the amount earned on all nonpurpose investments, any gain or loss on the disposition of such investments shall be taken into account.

(C) Reduction where issuer does not use full 1.125 percentage points under paragraph (2)

(i) In general

The amount required to be paid or credited to mortgagors under subparagraph (A) (determined under this paragraph without regard to this subparagraph) shall be reduced by the unused paragraph (2) amount.

(ii) Unused paragraph (2) amount

For purposes of clause (i), the unused paragraph (2) amount is the amount which (if it were treated as an interest payment made by mortgagors) would result in the excess referred to in paragraph (2)(A) being equal to 1.125 percentage points. Such amount shall be fixed and determined as of the yield determination date.

(D) Election to pay United States

Subparagraph (A) shall be satisfied with respect to any issue if the issuer elects before issuing the bonds to pay over to the United States

(i) not less frequently than once each 5 years after the date of issue, an amount equal to 90 percent of the aggregate amount which would be required to be paid or credited to mortgagors under subparagraph (A) (and not theretofore paid to the United States), and

(ii) not later than 60 days after the redemption of the last bond, 100 percent of such aggregate amount not theretofore paid to the United States.

(E) Simplified accounting

The Secretary shall permit any simplified system of accounting for purposes of this paragraph which the issuer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary will assure that the purposes of this paragraph are carried out.

(F) Nonpurpose investment

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “nonpurpose investment” has the meaning given such term by section 148(f)(6)(A).
