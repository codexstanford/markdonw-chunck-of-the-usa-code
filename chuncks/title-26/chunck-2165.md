##### (c) Tax treatment

(1) Distributions

(A) In general

Any distribution under a qualified ABLE program shall be includible in the gross income of the distributee in the manner as provided under section 72 to the extent not excluded from gross income under any other provision of this chapter.

(B) Distributions for qualified disability expenses

For purposes of this paragraph, if distributions from a qualified ABLE program

(i) do not exceed the qualified disability expenses of the designated beneficiary, no amount shall be includible in gross income, and

(ii) in any other case, the amount otherwise includible in gross income shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to such amount as such expenses bear to such distributions.

(C) Change in designated beneficiaries or programs

(i) Rollovers from ABLE accounts

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any amount paid or distributed from an ABLE account to the extent that the amount received is paid, not later than the 60th day after the date of such payment or distribution, into another ABLE account for the benefit of the same designated beneficiary or an eligible individual who is a member of the family of the designated beneficiary.

(ii) Change in designated beneficiaries

Any change in the designated beneficiary of an interest in a qualified ABLE program during a taxable year shall not be treated as a distribution for purposes of subparagraph (A) if the new beneficiary is an eligible individual for such taxable year and a member of the family of the former beneficiary.

(iii) Limitation on certain rollovers

Clause (i) shall not apply to any transfer if such transfer occurs within 12 months from the date of a previous transfer to any qualified ABLE program for the benefit of the designated beneficiary.

(2) Gift tax rules

For purposes of chapters 12 and 13

(A) Contributions

Any contribution to a qualified ABLE program on behalf of any designated beneficiary

(i) shall be treated as a completed gift to such designated beneficiary which is not a future interest in property, and

(ii) shall not be treated as a qualified transfer under section 2503(e).

(B) Treatment of distributions

In no event shall a distribution from an ABLE account to such account’s designated beneficiary be treated as a taxable gift.

(C) Treatment of transfer to new designated beneficiary

The taxes imposed by chapters 12 and 13 shall not apply to a transfer by reason of a change in the designated beneficiary under subsection (c)(1)(C).

(3) Additional tax for distributions not used for disability expenses

(A) In general

The tax imposed by this chapter for any taxable year on any taxpayer who receives a distribution from a qualified ABLE program which is includible in gross income shall be increased by 10 percent of the amount which is so includible.

(B) Exception

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the payment or distribution is made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the designated beneficiary) on or after the death of the designated beneficiary.

(C) Contributions returned before certain date

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the distribution of any contribution made during a taxable year on behalf of the designated beneficiary if

(i) such distribution is received on or before the day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for filing such designated beneficiary’s return for such taxable year, and

(ii) such distribution is accompanied by the amount of net income attributable to such excess contribution. Any net income described in clause (ii) shall be included in gross income for the taxable year in which such excess contribution was made.

(4) Loss of ABLE account treatment

If an ABLE account is established for a designated beneficiary, no account subsequently established for such beneficiary shall be treated as an ABLE account. The preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of an account established for purposes of a rollover described in paragraph (1)(C)(i) of this section if the transferor account is closed as of the end of the 60th day referred to in paragraph (1)(C)(i).
