The term “regulated natural gas” means domestic natural gas produced and sold by the producer, before July 1, 1976 , subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, the price for which has not been adjusted to reflect to any extent the increase in liability of the seller for tax under this chapter by reason of the repeal of percentage depletion for gas. Price increases after February 1, 1975 , shall be presumed to take increases in tax liabilities into account unless the taxpayer demonstrates the contrary by clear and convincing evidence.

(C) Qualified natural gas from geopressured brine

The term “qualified natural gas from geopressured brine” means any natural gas

(i) which is determined in accordance with section 503 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to be produced from geopressured brine, and
