##### (f) Special rules

(1) Only qualified carbon oxide captured and disposed of or used within the united states taken into account

(A) the United States (within the meaning of section 638(1)), or

(B) a possession of the United States (within the meaning of section 638(2)).

(2) Secure geological storage

The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior, shall establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of qualified carbon oxide under subsection (a) such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Such term shall include storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.

(3) Credit attributable to taxpayer

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B) or in any regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any credit under this section shall be attributable to

(i) in the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the person that captures and physically or contractually ensures the disposal, utilization, or use as a tertiary injectant of such qualified carbon oxide, and

(ii) in the case of qualified carbon oxide captured using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the person that owns the carbon capture equipment and physically or contractually ensures the capture and disposal, utilization, or use as a tertiary injectant of such qualified carbon oxide.

(B) Election

If the person described in subparagraph (A) makes an election under this subparagraph in such time and manner as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations, the credit under this section

(i) shall be allowable to the person that disposes of the qualified carbon oxide, utilizes the qualified carbon oxide, or uses the qualified carbon oxide as a tertiary injectant, and

(ii) shall not be allowable to the person described in subparagraph (A).

(4) Recapture

The Secretary shall, by regulations, provide for recapturing the benefit of any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any qualified carbon oxide which ceases to be captured, disposed of, or used as a tertiary injectant in a manner consistent with the requirements of this section.

(5) Utilization of qualified carbon oxide

(A) In general

For purposes of this section, utilization of qualified carbon oxide means

(i) the fixation of such qualified carbon oxide through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, such as through the growing of algae or bacteria,

(ii) the chemical conversion of such qualified carbon oxide to a material or chemical compound in which such qualified carbon oxide is securely stored, or

(iii) the use of such qualified carbon oxide for any other purpose for which a commercial market exists (with the exception of use as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project), as determined by the Secretary.

(B) Measurement

(i) In general

For purposes of determining the amount of qualified carbon oxide utilized by the taxpayer under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) or (4)(B)(ii) of subsection (a), such amount shall be equal to the metric tons of qualified carbon oxide which the taxpayer demonstrates, based upon an analysis of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and subject to such requirements as the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, determines appropriate, were

(I) captured and permanently isolated from the atmosphere, or

(II) displaced from being emitted into the atmosphere,  through use of a process described in subparagraph (A).

(ii) Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions

For purposes of clause (i), the term “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” has the same meaning given such term under subparagraph (H) of section 211( o )(1) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7545 ( o )(1)), as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, except that “product” shall be substituted for “fuel” each place it appears in such subparagraph.

(6) Election for applicable facilities

For purposes of this section, in the case of an applicable facility, for any taxable year in which such facility captures not less than 500,000 metric tons of qualified carbon oxide during the taxable year, the person described in paragraph (3)(A)(ii) may elect to have such facility, and any carbon capture equipment placed in service at such facility, deemed as having been placed in service on the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

(B) Applicable facility

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “applicable facility” means a qualified facility

(i) which was placed in service before the date of the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and

(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by

(B) the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) for such calendar year, determined by substituting “2008” for “1990”.

(8) Credit reduced for tax-exempt bonds

Rules similar to the rule under section 45(b)(3) shall apply for purposes of this section.

(A) no taxpayer claimed a credit under this section with respect to such carbon capture equipment for any prior taxable year,
