(2) Any tax, the assessment, collection, or payment of which is barred under subsection (a), or any such tax which has been abated or remitted shall be assessed or reassessed whenever it shall appear that payment of the tax will not diminish the assets as aforesaid.

(4) The running of the statute of limitations on the making of assessment and collection shall be suspended during, and for 90 days beyond, the period for which, pursuant to this section, assessment or collection may not be made, and a tax may be reassessed as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection and collected, during the time within which, had there been no abatement, collection might have been made.
