#### § 860. Deduction for deficiency dividends
##### (f) Deficiency dividends

(1) Definition

For purposes of this section, the term “deficiency dividends” means a distribution of property made by the qualified investment entity on or after the date of the determination and before filing claim under subsection (g), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists if distributed during such taxable year. No distribution of property shall be considered as deficiency dividends for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the determination, and unless a claim for a deficiency dividend deduction with respect to such distribution is filed pursuant to subsection (g).

(2) Limitations

(A) Ordinary dividends

The amount of deficiency dividends (other than deficiency dividends qualifying as capital gain dividends) paid by a qualified investment entity for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists shall not exceed the sum of

(i) the excess of the amount of increase referred to in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies) over the amount of any increase in the deduction for dividends paid (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) for such taxable year which results from such determination, and

(ii) the amount of decrease referred to in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies).

(B) Capital gain dividends

The amount of deficiency dividends qualifying as capital gain dividends paid by a qualified investment entity for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists shall not exceed the amount by which (i) the increase referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies), exceeds (ii) the amount of any dividends paid during such taxable year which are designated or reported (as the case may be) as capital gain dividends after such determination.

(3) Effect on dividends paid deduction

(A) For taxable year in which paid

Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year.

(B) For prior taxable year

Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be allowed for purposes of section 855(a) or 858(a) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.
