(1) Controlled group defined

For purposes of this section, the term “controlled group” has the meaning given to such term by section 1563(a), except that

(A) “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a), and

(B) the determination shall be made without regard to subsections (a)(4) and (e)(3)(C) of section 1563.

(2) Deferral (rather than denial) of loss from sale or exchange between members

In the case of any loss from the sale or exchange of property which is between members of the same controlled group and to which subsection (a)(1) applies (determined without regard to this paragraph but with regard to paragraph (3))

(A) subsections (a)(1) and (d) shall not apply to such loss, but

(B) such loss shall be deferred until the property is transferred outside such controlled group and there would be recognition of loss under consolidated return principles or until such other time as may be prescribed in regulations.

(3) Loss deferral rules not to apply in certain cases

(A) Transfer to DISC

For purposes of applying subsection (a)(1), the term “controlled group” shall not include a DISC.

(B) Certain sales of inventory

Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to the sale or exchange of property between members of the same controlled group (or persons described in subsection (b)(10)) if

(i) such property in the hands of the transferor is property described in section 1221(a)(1),

(ii) such sale or exchange is in the ordinary course of the transferor’s trade or business,

(iii) such property in the hands of the transferee is property described in section 1221(a)(1), and

(C) Certain foreign currency losses

To the extent provided in regulations, subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to any loss sustained by a member of a controlled group on the repayment of a loan made to another member of such group if such loan is payable in a foreign currency or is denominated in such a currency and such loss is attributable to a reduction in value of such foreign currency.

(D) Redemptions by fund-of-funds regulated investment companies

Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to any distribution in redemption of stock of a regulated investment company if

(i) such company issues only stock which is redeemable upon the demand of the stockholder, and

(ii) such redemption is upon the demand of another regulated investment company.

(4) Determination of relationship resulting in disallowance of loss, for purposes of other provisions

For purposes of any other section of this title which refers to a relationship which would result in a disallowance of losses under this section, deferral under paragraph (2) shall be treated as disallowance.
