(ii) the lesser of

(I) the amount of such deduction attributable to an applicable net operating loss with respect to which an election is made under section 172(b)(1)(H) (as in effect before its repeal by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014), or

(II) alternative minimum taxable income determined without regard to such deduction and the deduction under section 199  1 reduced by the amount determined under clause (i), and

(i) the net operating loss (within the meaning of section 172(c)) for any loss year shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (2), and
