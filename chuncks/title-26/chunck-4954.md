#### § 5006. Determination of tax
##### (b) Taxable loss

(1) On original quantity

Where there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been any loss of distilled spirits from any cask or other package deposited on bonded premises, other than a loss which by reason of section 5008(a) is not taxable, the Secretary may require the withdrawal from bonded premises of such distilled spirits, and direct the officer designated by him to collect the tax accrued on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such cask or package; except that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, when the extent of any loss from causes other than theft or unauthorized voluntary destruction can be established by the proprietor to the satisfaction of the Secretary an allowance of the tax on the loss so established may be credited against the tax on the original quantity. If such tax is not paid on demand it shall be assessed and collected as other taxes are assessed and collected.

(2) Alternative method

Where there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been access, other than is authorized by law, to the contents of casks or packages stored on bonded premises, and the extent of such access is such as to evidence a lack of due diligence or a failure to employ necessary and effective controls on the part of the proprietor, the Secretary (in lieu of requiring the casks or packages to which such access has been had to be withdrawn and tax paid on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such casks or packages as provided in paragraph (1)) may assess an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of distilled spirits at the prevailing rate on each of the total number of such casks or packages as determined by him.

(3) Application of subsection

The provisions of this subsection shall apply to distilled spirits which are filled into casks or packages, as authorized by law, after entry and deposit on bonded premises, whether by recasking, filling from storage tanks, consolidation of packages, or otherwise; and the quantity filled into such casks or packages shall be deemed to be the original quantity for the purpose of this subsection, in the case of loss from such casks or packages.
