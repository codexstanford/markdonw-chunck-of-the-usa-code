(ii) Retirements of indebtedness

If the federally-subsidized indebtedness is completely repaid during any year of the 4-year period beginning on the testing date, the holding period percentage for succeeding years shall be determined by reducing ratably to zero over the succeeding 5 years the holding period percentage which would have been determined under this subparagraph had the taxpayer disposed of his interest in the residence on the date of the repayment.

(6) Special rules relating to limitation on recapture amount based on gain realized

(A) In general

For purposes of paragraph (1), gain shall be taken into account whether or not recognized, and the adjusted basis of the taxpayer’s interest in the residence shall be determined without regard to sections 1033(b) and 1034(e) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997) for purposes of determining gain.

(B) Dispositions other than sales, exchanges, and involuntary conversions

(C) Transfers to spouses and former spouses

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any transfer on which no gain or loss is recognized under section 1041. In any such case, the transferee shall be treated under this subsection in the same manner as the transferor would have been treated had such transfer not occurred.
