## Subtitle A— Income Taxes
### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 877. Expatriation to avoid tax
##### (d) Special rules for source, etc.

For purposes of subsection (b)

(1) Source rules

The following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources within the United States:

(A) Sale of property

Gains on the sale or exchange of property (other than stock or debt obligations) located in the United States.

(B) Stock or debt obligations

Gains on the sale or exchange of stock issued by a domestic corporation or debt obligations of United States persons or of the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.

(C) Income or gain derived from controlled foreign corporation

Any income or gain derived from stock in a foreign corporation but only

(i) if the individual losing United States citizenship owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)), or is considered as owning (by applying the ownership rules of section 958(b)), at any time during the 2-year period ending on the date of the loss of United States citizenship, more than 50 percent of

(I) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such corporation, or

(II) the total value of the stock of such corporation, and

(ii) to the extent such income or gain does not exceed the earnings and profits attributable to such stock which were earned or accumulated before the loss of citizenship and during periods that the ownership requirements of clause (i) are met.

(2) Gain recognition on certain exchanges

(A) In general

In the case of any exchange of property to which this paragraph applies, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, such property shall be treated as sold for its fair market value on the date of such exchange, and any gain shall be recognized for the taxable year which includes such date.

(B) Exchanges to which paragraph applies

This paragraph shall apply to any exchange during the 10-year period beginning on the date the individual loses United States citizenship if

(i) gain would not (but for this paragraph) be recognized on such exchange in whole or in part for purposes of this subtitle,

(ii) income derived from such property was from sources within the United States (or, if no income was so derived, would have been from such sources), and

(iii) income derived from the property acquired in the exchange would be from sources outside the United States.

(C) Exception

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the individual enters into an agreement with the Secretary which specifies that any income or gain derived from the property acquired in the exchange (or any other property which has a basis determined in whole or part by reference to such property) during such 10-year period shall be treated as from sources within the United States. If the property transferred in the exchange is disposed of by the person acquiring such property, such agreement shall terminate and any gain which was not recognized by reason of such agreement shall be recognized as of the date of such disposition.

(D) Secretary may extend period

To the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting the 15-year period beginning 5 years before the loss of United States citizenship for the 10-year period referred to therein. In the case of any exchange occurring during such 5 years, any gain recognized under this subparagraph shall be recognized immediately after such loss of citizenship.

(E) Secretary may require recognition of gain in certain cases

To the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary

(i) the removal of appreciated tangible personal property from the United States, and

(ii) any other occurrence which (without recognition of gain) results in a change in the source of the income or gain from property from sources within the United States to sources outside the United States, shall be treated as an exchange to which this paragraph applies.

(3) Substantial diminishing of risks of ownership

For purposes of determining whether this section applies to any gain on the sale or exchange of any property, the running of the 10-year period described in subsection (a) and the period applicable under paragraph (2) shall be suspended for any period during which the individual’s risk of loss with respect to the property is substantially diminished by

(A) the holding of a put with respect to such property (or similar property),

(B) the holding by another person of a right to acquire the property, or

(C) a short sale or any other transaction.

(4) Treatment of property contributed to controlled foreign corporations

(A) In general

If

(i) an individual losing United States citizenship contributes property during the 10-year period beginning on the date the individual loses United States citizenship to any corporation which, at the time of the contribution, is described in subparagraph (B), and

(ii) income derived from such property immediately before such contribution was from sources within the United States (or, if no income was so derived, would have been from such sources), any income or gain on such property (or any other property which has a basis determined in whole or part by reference to such property) received or accrued by the corporation shall be treated as received or accrued directly by such individual and not by such corporation. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent the property has been treated under subparagraph (C) as having been sold by such corporation.

(B) Corporation described

A corporation is described in this subparagraph with respect to an individual if, were such individual a United States citizen

(i) such corporation would be a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957), and

(ii) such individual would be a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) with respect to such corporation.

(C) Disposition of stock in corporation

If stock in the corporation referred to in subparagraph (A) (or any other stock which has a basis determined in whole or part by reference to such stock) is disposed of during the 10-year period referred to in subsection (a) and while the property referred to in subparagraph (A) is held by such corporation, a pro rata share of such property (determined on the basis of the value of such stock) shall be treated as sold by the corporation immediately before such disposition.

(D) Anti-abuse rules

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this paragraph, including where

(i) the property is sold to the corporation, and

(ii) the property taken into account under subparagraph (A) is sold by the corporation.

(E) Information reporting

The Secretary shall require such information reporting as is necessary to carry out the purposes of this paragraph.
