For purposes of this section

(A) In general

The term “qualified current retiree liabilities” means, with respect to any taxable year, the aggregate amounts (including administrative expenses) which would have been allowable as a deduction to the employer for such taxable year with respect to applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits provided during such taxable year if

(i) such benefits were provided directly by the employer, and

(ii) the employer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rule of section 419(c)(3)(B) shall apply.

(B) Reductions for amounts previously set aside

The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by the amount (determined separately for applicable health benefits and applicable life insurance benefits) which bears the same ratio to such amount as

(i) the value (as of the close of the plan year preceding the year of the qualified transfer) of the assets in all health benefits accounts or applicable life insurance accounts or welfare benefit funds (as defined in section 419(e)(1)) set aside to pay for the qualified current retiree liability, bears to

(ii) the present value of the qualified current retiree liabilities for all plan years (determined without regard to this subparagraph).

(C) Applicable health benefits

The term “applicable health benefits” means health benefits or coverage which are provided to

(i) retired employees who, immediately before the qualified transfer, are entitled to receive such benefits by reason of retirement and who are entitled to pension benefits under the plan, and

(ii) their spouses and dependents.

(D) Applicable life insurance benefits

The term “applicable life insurance benefits” means group-term life insurance coverage provided to retired employees who, immediately before the qualified transfer, are entitled to receive such coverage by reason of retirement and who are entitled to pension benefits under the plan, but only to the extent that such coverage is provided under a policy for retired employees and the cost of such coverage is excludable from the retired employee’s gross income under section 79.

(E) Key employees excluded

If an employee is a key employee (within the meaning of section 416(i)(1)) with respect to any plan year ending in a taxable year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing qualified current retiree liabilities for such taxable year or in calculating applicable employer cost under subsection (c)(3)(B).

(2) Excess pension assets

The term “excess pension assets” means the excess (if any) of

(A) the lesser of

(i) the fair market value of the plan’s assets (reduced by the prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance determined under section 430(f)), or

(ii) the value of plan assets as determined under section 430(g)(3) after reduction under section 430(f), over

(B) 125 percent of the sum of the funding target and the target normal cost determined under section 430 for such plan year.

(3) Health benefits account

The term “health benefits account” means an account established and maintained under section 401(h).

(4) Applicable life insurance account

The term “applicable life insurance account” means a separate account established and maintained for amounts transferred under this section for qualified current retiree liabilities based on premiums for applicable life insurance benefits.

(5) Coordination with sections 430 and 433

In the case of a qualified transfer, any assets so transferred shall not, for purposes of this section and sections 430 and 433, be treated as assets in the plan.

(6) Application to multiemployer plans

In the case of a multiemployer plan, this section shall be applied to any such plan

(A) by treating any reference in this section to an employer as a reference to all employers maintaining the plan (or, if appropriate, the plan sponsor), and

(B) in accordance with such modifications of this section (and the provisions of this title relating to this section) as the Secretary determines appropriate to reflect the fact the plan is not maintained by a single employer.
