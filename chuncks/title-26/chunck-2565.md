#### § 814. Contiguous country branches of domestic life insurance companies
##### (e) Transactions between contiguous country branch and domestic life insurance company

(1) Reimbursement for home office services, etc.

Any payment, transfer, reimbursement, credit, or allowance which is made from a separate account established pursuant to subsection (c) to one or more other accounts of a domestic life insurance company as reimbursement for costs incurred for or with respect to the insurance (or reinsurance) of risks accounted for in such separate account shall be taken into account by the domestic life insurance company in the same manner as if such payment, transfer, reimbursement, credit, or allowance had been received from a separate person.

(2) Repatriation of income

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any amount directly or indirectly transferred or credited from a branch account established pursuant to subsection (c) to one or more other accounts of such company shall, unless such transfer or credit is a reimbursement to which paragraph (1) applies, be added to the income of the domestic life insurance company.

(B) Limitation

The addition provided by subparagraph (A) for the taxable year with respect to any contiguous country life insurance branch shall not exceed the amount by which

(i) the aggregate decrease in the tentative LICTI of the domestic life insurance company for the taxable year and for all prior taxable years resulting solely from the application of subsection (a) of this section with respect to such branch, exceeds

(ii) the amount of additions to tentative LICTI pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to such contiguous country branch for all prior taxable years.

(C) Transitional rule

For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a prior taxable year beginning before January 1, 1984 , the term “tentative LICTI” means life insurance company taxable income determined under this part (as in effect for such year) without regard to this paragraph.
