#### § 743. Special rules where section 754 election or substantial built-in loss
##### (e) Alternative rules for electing investment partnerships

(1) No adjustment of partnership basis

For purposes of this section, an electing investment partnership shall not be treated as having a substantial built-in loss with respect to any transfer occurring while the election under paragraph (6)(A) is in effect.

(2) Loss deferral for transferee partner

In the case of a transfer of an interest in an electing investment partnership, the transferee partner’s distributive share of losses (without regard to gains) from the sale or exchange of partnership property shall not be allowed except to the extent that it is established that such losses exceed the loss (if any) recognized by the transferor (or any prior transferor to the extent not fully offset by a prior disallowance under this paragraph) on the transfer of the partnership interest.

(3) No reduction in partnership basis

Losses disallowed under paragraph (2) shall not decrease the transferee partner’s basis in the partnership interest.

(4) Certain basis reductions treated as losses

In the case of a transferee partner whose basis in property distributed by the partnership is reduced under section 732(a)(2), the amount of the loss recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the partnership interest which is taken into account under paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the amount of such basis reduction.
