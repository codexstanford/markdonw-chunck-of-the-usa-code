#### § 877A. Tax responsibilities of expatriation
##### (h) Other rules

(1) Termination of deferrals, etc.

In the case of any covered expatriate, notwithstanding any other provision of this title

(A) any time period for acquiring property which would result in the reduction in the amount of gain recognized with respect to property disposed of by the taxpayer shall terminate on the day before the expatriation date, and

(B) any extension of time for payment of tax shall cease to apply on the day before the expatriation date and the unpaid portion of such tax shall be due and payable at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary.

(2) Step-up in basis

Solely for purposes of determining any tax imposed by reason of subsection (a), property which was held by an individual on the date the individual first became a resident of the United States (within the meaning of section 7701(b)) shall be treated as having a basis on such date of not less than the fair market value of such property on such date. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the individual elects not to have such sentence apply. Such an election, once made, shall be irrevocable.

(3) Coordination with section 684

If the expatriation of any individual would result in the recognition of gain under section 684, this section shall be applied after the application of section 684.
