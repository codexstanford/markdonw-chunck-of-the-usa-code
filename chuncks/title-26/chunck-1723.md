### CHAPTER 1— NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES
#### § 416. Special rules for top-heavy plans
##### (g) Top-heavy plan defined

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

(A) Plans not required to be aggregated

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “top-heavy plan” means, with respect to any plan year

(i) any defined benefit plan if, as of the determination date, the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits under the plan for key employees exceeds 60 percent of the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits under the plan for all employees, and

(ii) any defined contribution plan if, as of the determination date, the aggregate of the accounts of key employees under the plan exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate of the accounts of all employees under such plan.

(B) Aggregated plans

Each plan of an employer required to be included in an aggregation group shall be treated as a top-heavy plan if such group is a top-heavy group.

(2) Aggregation

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Aggregation group

(i) Required aggregation

The term “aggregation group” means

(I) each plan of the employer in which a key employee is a participant, and

(II) each other plan of the employer which enables any plan described in subclause (I) to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) or 410.

(ii) Permissive aggregation

The employer may treat any plan not required to be included in an aggregation group under clause (i) as being part of such group if such group would continue to meet the requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410 with such plan being taken into account.

(B) Top-heavy group

The term “top-heavy group” means any aggregation group if

(i) the sum (as of the determination date) of

(I) the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits for key employees under all defined benefit plans included in such group, and

(II) the aggregate of the accounts of key employees under all defined contribution plans included in such group,

(ii) exceeds 60 percent of a similar sum determined for all employees.

(3) Distributions during last year before determination date taken into account

(A) In general

For purposes of determining

(i) the present value of the cumulative accrued benefit for any employee, or

(ii) the amount of the account of any employee, such present value or amount shall be increased by the aggregate distributions made with respect to such employee under the plan during the 1-year period ending on the determination date. The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated would have been required to be included in an aggregation group.

(B) 5-year period in case of in-service distribution

In the case of any distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death, or disability, subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “5-year period” for “1-year period”.

(4) Other special rules

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Rollover contributions to plan not taken into account

Except to the extent provided in regulations, any rollover contribution (or similar transfer) initiated by the employee and made after December 31, 1983 , to a plan shall not be taken into account with respect to the transferee plan for purposes of determining whether such plan is a top-heavy plan (or whether any aggregation group which includes such plan is a top-heavy group).

(B) Benefits not taken into account if employee ceases to be key employee

If any individual is a non-key employee with respect to any plan for any plan year, but such individual was a key employee with respect to such plan for any prior plan year, any accrued benefit for such employee (and the account of such employee) shall not be taken into account.

(C) Determination date

The term “determination date” means, with respect to any plan year

(i) the last day of the preceding plan year, or

(ii) in the case of the first plan year of any plan, the last day of such plan year.

(D) Years

To the extent provided in regulations, this section shall be applied on the basis of any year specified in such regulations in lieu of plan years.

(E) Benefits not taken into account if employee not employed for last year before determination date

If any individual has not performed services for the employer maintaining the plan at any time during the 1-year period ending on the determination date, any accrued benefit for such individual (and the account of such individual) shall not be taken into account.

(F) Accrued benefits treated as accruing ratably

The accrued benefit of any employee (other than a key employee) shall be determined

(i) under the method which is used for accrual purposes for all plans of the employer, or

(ii) if there is no method described in clause (i), as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under section 411(b)(1)(C).

(G) Simple retirement accounts

The term “top-heavy plan” shall not include a simple retirement account under section 408(p).

(H) Cash or deferred arrangements using alternative methods of meeting nondiscrimination requirements

The term “top-heavy plan” shall not include a plan which consists solely of

(i) a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of section 401(k)(12) or 401(k)(13), and

(ii) matching contributions with respect to which the requirements of section 401(m)(11) or 401(m)(12) are met. If, but for this subparagraph, a plan would be treated as a top-heavy plan because it is a member of an aggregation group which is a top-heavy group, contributions under the plan may be taken into account in determining whether any other plan in the group meets the requirements of subsection (c)(2).
