The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the development and implementation of an electronic fund transfer system which is required to be used for the collection of depository taxes. Such system shall be designed in such manner as may be necessary to ensure that such taxes are credited to the general account of the Treasury on the date on which such taxes would otherwise have been required to be deposited under the Federal tax deposit system.

(B) Exemptions

The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) may contain such exemptions as the Secretary may deem appropriate.

(2) Definitions

For purposes of this subsection

(A) Depository tax

The term “depository tax” means any tax if the Secretary is authorized to require deposits of such tax.

(B) Electronic fund transfer

The term “electronic fund transfer” means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution or other financial intermediary to debit or credit an account.

(3) Coordination with other electronic fund transfer requirements

Under regulations, any tax required to be paid by electronic fund transfer under section 5061(e) or 5703(b) shall be paid in such a manner as to ensure that the requirements of the second sentence of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection are satisfied.
