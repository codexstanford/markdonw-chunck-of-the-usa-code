#### § 5006. Determination of tax
##### (a) Requirements

(1) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax on distilled spirits shall be determined when the spirits are withdrawn from bond. Such tax shall be determined by such means as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, and with the use of such devices and apparatus (including but not limited to tanks and pipelines) as the Secretary may require. The tax on distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant shall be determined upon completion of the gauge for determination of tax and before withdrawal from bonded premises, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe.

(2) Distilled spirits not accounted for

If the Secretary finds that the distiller has not accounted for all the distilled spirits produced by him, he shall, from all the evidence he can obtain, determine what quantity of distilled spirits was actually produced by such distiller, and an assessment shall be made for the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity shown to have been actually produced at the rate of tax imposed by law for every proof gallon.
