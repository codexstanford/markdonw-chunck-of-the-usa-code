The payment of a special tax imposed by this subchapter shall not exempt from an additional special tax the person carrying on a trade or business in any other place than that stated in the register kept in the office of the official in charge of the internal revenue district.

(2) Storage

Nothing contained in paragraph (1) shall require a special tax for the storage of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes at a location other than the place where tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes are sold or offered for sale.

(3) Definition of place

The term “place” as used in this section means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship; and passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises, shall not be deemed sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the various divisions are otherwise contiguous.
