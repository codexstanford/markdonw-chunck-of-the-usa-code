The term “ordinary income” means the investment company taxable income (as defined in section 852(b)(2)) determined

(A) without regard to subparagraphs (A) and (D) of section 852(b)(2),

(B) by not taking into account any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, and

(2) Capital gain net income

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “capital gain net income” has the meaning given such term by section 1222(9) (determined by treating the 1-year period ending on October 31 of any calendar year as the company’s taxable year).

(B) Reduction by net ordinary loss for calendar year

The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced (but not below the net capital gain) by the amount of the company’s net ordinary loss for the calendar year.

(C) Definitions

For purposes of this paragraph

(i) Net capital gain

The term “net capital gain” has the meaning given such term by section 1222(11) (determined by treating the 1-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year as the company’s taxable year).

(ii) Net ordinary loss

The net ordinary loss for the calendar year is the amount which would be the net operating loss of the company for the calendar year if the amount of such loss were determined in the same manner as ordinary income is determined under paragraph (1).

(3) Treatment of deficiency distributions

In the case of any deficiency dividend (as defined in section 860(f))

(4) Election to use taxable year in certain cases

(A) In general

If

(i) the taxable year of the regulated investment company ends with the month of November or December, and

(ii) such company makes an election under this paragraph, subsection (b)(1)(B) and paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be applied by taking into account the company’s taxable year in lieu of the 1-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year.

(B) Election revocable only with consent

An election under this paragraph, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

(5) Treatment of specified gains and losses after October 31 of calendar year

(A) In general

Any specified gain or specified loss which (but for this paragraph) would be properly taken into account for the portion of the calendar year after October 31 shall be treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year.

(B) Specified gains and losses

For purposes of this paragraph

(i) Specified gain

The term “specified gain” means ordinary gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property (including the termination of a position with respect to such property).

In the case of any company making an election under paragraph (4), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting the last day of the company’s taxable year for October 31.

(6) Treatment of mark to market gain

(A) In general

For purposes of determining a regulated investment company’s ordinary income, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C), each specified mark to market provision shall be applied as if such company’s taxable year ended on October 31. In the case of a company making an election under paragraph (4), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting the last day of the company’s taxable year for October 31.

(B) Specified mark to market provision

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “specified mark to market provision” means sections 1256 and 1296 and any other provision of this title (or regulations thereunder) which treats property as disposed of on the last day of the taxable year or which determines income by reference to the value of an item on the last day of the taxable year.

(7) Elective deferral of certain ordinary losses

Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in the case of a regulated investment company which has a taxable year other than the calendar year

(A) such company may elect to determine its ordinary income and net ordinary loss (as defined in paragraph (2)(C)(ii)) for the calendar year without regard to any portion of any net ordinary loss (determined without regard to specified gains and losses taken into account under paragraph (5)) which is attributable to the portion of such calendar year which is after the beginning of the taxable year which begins in such calendar year, and

(B) any amount of net ordinary loss not taken into account for a calendar year by reason of subparagraph (A) shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the following calendar year.
