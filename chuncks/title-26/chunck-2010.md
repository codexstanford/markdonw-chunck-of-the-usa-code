##### (d) Exception for certain leases

This section shall not apply to any lease of property which meets the requirements of all of the following paragraphs:

(1) Availability of funds

(A) In general

A lease of property meets the requirements of this paragraph if (at all times during the lease term) not more than an allowable amount of funds are

(i) subject to any arrangement referred to in subparagraph (B), or

(ii) set aside or expected to be set aside, to or for the benefit of the lessor or any lender, or to or for the benefit of the lessee to satisfy the lessee’s obligations or options under the lease. For purposes of clause (ii), funds shall be treated as set aside or expected to be set aside only if a reasonable person would conclude, based on the facts and circumstances, that such funds are set aside or expected to be set aside.

(B) Arrangements

The arrangements referred to in this subparagraph include a defeasance arrangement, a loan by the lessee to the lessor or any lender, a deposit arrangement, a letter of credit collateralized with cash or cash equivalents, a payment undertaking agreement, prepaid rent (within the meaning of the regulations under section 467), a sinking fund arrangement, a guaranteed investment contract, financial guaranty insurance, and any similar arrangement (whether or not such arrangement provides credit support).

(C) Allowable amount

(i) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the term “allowable amount” means an amount equal to 20 percent of the lessor’s adjusted basis in the property at the time the lease is entered into.

(ii) Higher amount permitted in certain cases

To the extent provided in regulations, a higher percentage shall be permitted under clause (i) where necessary because of the credit-worthiness of the lessee. In no event may such regulations permit a percentage of more than 50 percent.

(iii) Option to purchase

If under the lease the lessee has the option to purchase the property for a fixed price or for other than the fair market value of the property (determined at the time of exercise), the allowable amount at the time such option may be exercised may not exceed 50 percent of the price at which such option may be exercised.

(iv) No allowable amount for certain arrangements

The allowable amount shall be zero with respect to any arrangement which involves

(I) a loan from the lessee to the lessor or a lender,

(II) any deposit received, letter of credit issued, or payment undertaking agreement entered into by a lender otherwise involved in the transaction, or

(III) in the case of a transaction which involves a lender, any credit support made available to the lessor in which any such lender does not have a claim that is senior to the lessor.  For purposes of subclause (I), the term “loan” shall not include any amount treated as a loan under section 467 with respect to a section 467 rental agreement.

(2) Lessor must make substantial equity investment

(A) In general

A lease of property meets the requirements of this paragraph if

(i) the lessor

(I) has at the time the lease is entered into an unconditional at-risk equity investment (as determined by the Secretary) in the property of at least 20 percent of the lessor’s adjusted basis in the property as of that time, and

(II) maintains such investment throughout the term of the lease, and

(ii) the fair market value of the property at the end of the lease term is reasonably expected to be equal to at least 20 percent of such basis.

(B) Risk of loss

For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the fair market value at the end of the lease term shall be reduced to the extent that a person other than the lessor bears a risk of loss in the value of the property.

(C) Paragraph not to apply to short-term leases

This paragraph shall not apply to any lease with a lease term of 5 years or less.

(3) Lessee may not bear more than minimal risk of loss

(A) In general

A lease of property meets the requirements of this paragraph if there is no arrangement under which the lessee bears

(i) any portion of the loss that would occur if the fair market value of the leased property were 25 percent less than its reasonably expected fair market value at the time the lease is terminated, or

(ii) more than 50 percent of the loss that would occur if the fair market value of the leased property at the time the lease is terminated were zero.

(B) Exception

The Secretary may by regulations provide that the requirements of this paragraph are not met where the lessee bears more than a minimal risk of loss.

(C) Paragraph not to apply to short-term leases

This paragraph shall not apply to any lease with a lease term of 5 years or less.

(4) Property with more than 7-year class life

In the case of a lease

(A) of property with a class life (as defined in section 168(i)(1)) of more than 7 years, other than fixed-wing aircraft and vessels, and

(B) under which the lessee has the option to purchase the property, the lease meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the purchase price under the option equals the fair market value of the property (determined at the time of exercise).
