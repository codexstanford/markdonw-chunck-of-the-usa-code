#### § 7519. Required payments for entities electing not to have required taxable year
##### (d) Net base year income

For purposes of this section

(1) In general

An entity’s net base year income shall be equal to the sum of

(A) the deferral ratio multiplied by the entity’s net income for the base year, plus

(B) the excess (if any) of

(i) the deferral ratio multiplied by the aggregate amount of applicable payments made by the entity during the base year, over

(ii) the aggregate amount of such applicable payments made during the deferral period of the base year. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “deferral ratio” means the ratio which the number of months in the deferral period of the base year bears to the number of months in the partnership’s or S corporation’s taxable year.

(2) Net income

Net income is determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the following items

(A) Partnerships

In the case of a partnership, net income shall be the amount (not below zero) determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the partnership’s items described in section 702(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income).

(B) S corporations

In the case of an S corporation, net income shall be the amount (not below zero) determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the S corporation’s items described in section 1366(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income). If the S corporation was a C corporation for the base year, its taxable income for such year shall be treated as its net income for such year (and such corporation shall be treated as an S corporation for such taxable year for purposes of paragraph (3)).

(C) Certain limitations disregarded

For purposes of subparagraph (A) or (B), any limitation on the amount of any item described in either such paragraph which may be taken into account for purposes of computing the taxable income of a partner or shareholder shall be disregarded.

(B) Exceptions

The term “applicable payment” shall not include any

(i) gain from the sale or exchange of property between the partner or shareholder and the partnership or S corporation, and

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the applicable percentage for any partnership or S corporation shall be 100 percent unless more than 50 percent of such entity’s net income for the short taxable year which would have resulted if the entity had not made an election under section 444 would have been allocated to partners or shareholders who would have been entitled to the benefits of section 806(e)(2)(C) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 with respect to such income.

(5) Treatment of guaranteed payments

(A) In general

Any guaranteed payment by a partnership shall not be treated as an applicable payment, and the amount of the net income of the partnership shall be determined by not taking such guaranteed payment into account.

(B) Guaranteed payment

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “guaranteed payment” means any payment referred to in section 707(c).
