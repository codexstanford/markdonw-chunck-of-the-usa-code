### CHAPTER 80— GENERAL RULES
#### § 7874. Rules relating to expatriated entities and their foreign parents
##### (e) Special rules

(1) Credits not allowed against tax on inversion gain

Credits (other than the credit allowed by section 901) shall be allowed against the tax imposed by this chapter on an expatriated entity for any taxable year described in subsection (a) only to the extent such tax exceeds the product of

(A) the amount of the inversion gain for the taxable year, and

(B) the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b). For purposes of determining the credit allowed by section 901, inversion gain shall be treated as from sources within the United States.

(2) Special rules for partnerships

In the case of an expatriated entity which is a partnership

(A) subsection (a)(1) shall apply at the partner rather than the partnership level,

(B) the inversion gain of any partner for any taxable year shall be equal to the sum of

(i) the partner’s distributive share of inversion gain of the partnership for such taxable year, plus

(ii) gain recognized for the taxable year by the partner by reason of the transfer during the applicable period of any partnership interest of the partner in such partnership to the surrogate foreign corporation, and

(C) the highest rate of tax specified in the rate schedule applicable to the partner under this chapter shall be substituted for the rate of tax referred to in paragraph (1).

(3) Coordination with section 172 and minimum tax

Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 860E(a) shall apply for purposes of subsection (a).

(4) Statute of limitations

(A) In general

The statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to the inversion gain of any taxpayer for any pre-inversion year shall not expire before the expiration of 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified by the taxpayer (in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe) of the acquisition described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) to which such gain relates and such deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.

(B) Pre-inversion year

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “pre-inversion year” means any taxable year if

(i) any portion of the applicable period is included in such taxable year, and

(ii) such year ends before the taxable year in which the acquisition described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) is completed.
