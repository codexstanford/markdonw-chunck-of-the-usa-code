(i) which (at the time of such use), is registered, or is required to be registered, for highway use under the laws of any State or foreign country, or

(ii) which, in the case of a highway vehicle owned by the United States, is used on the highway.

Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the term “off-highway business use” does not include any use in a motorboat.

For purposes of clause (ii)(I), the design-based test is met if the vehicle consists of a chassis

(I) to which there has been permanently mounted (by welding, bolting, riveting, or other means) machinery or equipment to perform a construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling, timbering, or similar operation if the operation of the machinery or equipment is unrelated to transportation on or off the public highways,

(II) which has been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage and mount (and a power source, where applicable) for the particular machinery or equipment involved, whether or not such machinery or equipment is in operation, and
