###### (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) through (g), and subject to subsection (h), of this section, the period during which an individual entitled to educational assistance under this chapter may use such individual’s entitlement expires at the end of the 10-year period beginning on the date of such individual’s last discharge or release from active duty, except that such 10-year period shall begin

(1) in the case of an individual who becomes entitled to such assistance under clause (A) or (B) of section 3012(a)(1) of this title , on the later of the date of such individual’s last discharge or release from active duty or the date on which the four-year requirement described in clause (A)(ii) or (B)(ii), respectively, of such section 3012(a)(1) is met;

(2) in the case of an individual who becomes entitled to such assistance under section 3011(a)(1)(B), on the later of the date of such individual’s last discharge or release from active duty or January 1, 1990 ; and

(3) in the case of an individual who becomes entitled to such assistance under section 3011(a)(1)(C) or 3012(a)(1)(C) of this title, on December 27, 2001 .

(b) In the case of any eligible individual who has been prevented, as determined by the Secretary, from pursuing a program of education under this chapter within the 10-year period prescribed by subsection (a) of this section because such individual had not met the nature of discharge requirement of this chapter before the nature of such individual’s discharge or release was changed by appropriate authority, such 10-year period shall not run during the period of time that such individual was so prevented from pursuing such program of education.

(c) In the case of an individual eligible for educational assistance under the provisions of this chapter who, after such individual’s last discharge or release from active duty, was detained by a foreign government or power, the 10-year period described in subsection (a) of this section shall not run (1) while such individual is so detained, or (2) during any period immediately following such individual’s release from such detention during which such individual is hospitalized at a military, civilian, or Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility.

(d)

(1) In the case of an individual eligible for educational assistance under this chapter who is prevented from pursuing the individual’s chosen program of education before the expiration of the 10-year period for the use of entitlement under this chapter otherwise applicable under this section because of a physical or mental disability which is not the result of the individual’s own willful misconduct, such 10-year period

(A) shall not run during the period the individual is so prevented from pursuing such program; and

(B) shall again begin running on the first day after the individual’s recovery from such disability on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for the individual to initiate or resume pursuit of a program of education with educational assistance under this chapter.
