### CHAPTER 41— JOB COUNSELING, TRAINING, AND PLACEMENT SERVICE FOR VETERANS
#### § 4107. Administrative controls; annual report

(a) The Secretary shall establish administrative controls for the following purposes:

(1) To insure that each eligible veteran, especially veterans of the Vietnam era and disabled veterans, and each eligible person who requests assistance under this chapter shall promptly be placed in a satisfactory job or job training opportunity or receive some other specific form of assistance designed to enhance such veteran’s and eligible person’s employment prospects substantially, such as individual job development or intensive services.

(2) To determine whether or not the employment service agencies in each State have committed the necessary staff to insure that the provisions of this chapter are carried out; and to arrange for necessary corrective action where staff resources have been determined by the Secretary to be inadequate.

(b) The Secretary shall apply performance standards established under section 4102A(f) of this title for determining compliance by the State public employment service agencies with the provisions of this chapter and chapter 42 of this title. Not later than February 1 of each year, the Secretary shall report to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the performance of States and organizations and entities carrying out employment, training, and placement services under this chapter, as measured under subsection (b)(7) of section 4102A of this title . In the case of a State that the Secretary determines has not met the minimum standard of performance (established by the Secretary under subsection (f) of such section), the Secretary shall include an analysis of the extent and reasons for the State’s failure to meet that minimum standard, together with the State’s plan for corrective action during the succeeding year.
