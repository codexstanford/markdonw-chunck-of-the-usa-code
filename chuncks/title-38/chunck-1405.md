###### (b) Discontinuance of Allowances .

(1) The Secretary may discontinue the educational assistance allowance of any eligible veteran or eligible person if the Secretary finds that the program of education or any course in which the veteran or person is enrolled fails to meet any of the requirements of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or if the Secretary finds that the educational institution offering such program or course has violated any provision of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or fails to meet any of the requirements of such chapters.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, any action by the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection to discontinue (including to suspend) assistance provided to any eligible veteran or eligible person under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title shall be based upon evidence that the veteran or eligible person is not or was not entitled to such assistance. Whenever the Secretary so discontinues any such assistance, the Secretary shall concurrently provide written notice to such veteran or person of such discontinuance and that such veteran or person is entitled thereafter to a statement of the reasons for such action and an opportunity to be heard thereon.

(3)

(A) The Secretary may suspend educational assistance to eligible veterans and eligible persons already enrolled, and may disapprove the enrollment or reenrollment of any eligible veteran or eligible person, in any course as to which the Secretary has evidence showing a substantial pattern of eligible veterans or eligible persons, or both, who are receiving such assistance by virtue of their enrollment in such course but who are not entitled to such assistance because (i) the course approval requirements of this chapter are not being met, or (ii) the educational institution offering such course has violated one or more of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this chapter or chapter 30, 32, 33, 34, or 35 of this title.
