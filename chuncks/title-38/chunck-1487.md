### CHAPTER 37— HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS
#### § 3712. Loans to purchase manufactured homes and lots
######## (A) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title

(i) the loan must be secured by the same manufactured home as was the loan being refinanced and such manufactured home must be owned and occupied by the veteran (except as provided in section 3704(c)(2) of this title ) as such veteran’s home; and

(ii) the amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of

(I) the purchase price of the lot,

(II) the amount (if any) determined by the Secretary to be appropriate under paragraph (2) of this subsection to cover the cost of necessary preparation of such lot,

(III) the balance of the loan being refinanced, and

(IV) such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(E) of this title ) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan.

(B) When a loan is made to a veteran for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title , and the loan being refinanced was guaranteed, insured, or made under this section, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing such loan may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran’s guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such portion of such loan. For the purposes of section 3702(b) of this title , such portion of such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.

(b)

(1) Use of entitlement for purposes specified in this section for the purchase of a manufactured home unit shall preclude the use of remaining entitlement for the purchase of an additional manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.

(2) The Secretary shall restore entitlement to all housing loan benefits under this chapter for the veteran when the conditions prescribed in section 3702(b) of this title have been met.

(c)

(1) Loans for any of the purposes authorized by subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to the closing of the loan, except that the Secretary may exempt any lender of a class listed in section 3702(d) of this title from compliance with such prior approval requirement if the Secretary determines that the experience of such lender or class of lenders in manufactured home financing warrants such exemption.

(2) Upon determining that a loan submitted for prior approval is eligible for guaranty for purposes specified in this section, the Secretary shall issue a commitment to guarantee such loan and shall thereafter guarantee the loan when made if such loan qualifies therefor in all respects.

(3)

(A) The Secretary’s guaranty may not exceed the lesser of (i) the lesser of $20,000 or 40 percent of the loan, or (ii) the maximum amount of the guaranty entitlement available to the veteran as specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection.
