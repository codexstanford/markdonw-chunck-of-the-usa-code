(A) may not charge the eligible individual for any cost of such emergent suicide care; and

(B) shall pay for any costs of emergency transportation to a facility for such emergent suicide care (as such costs are determined pursuant to section 1725 of this title , to the extent practicable).

(2)

(A) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), if the Secretary pays for emergent suicide care provided under subsection (a) to an eligible individual at a non-Department facility, the Secretary shall reimburse the facility for the reasonable value of such emergent suicide care.

(B)

(i) In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary may determine the amount to reimburse a non-Department facility in a similar manner to the manner in which the Secretary determines reimbursement amounts for that non-Department facility for medical care and services provided under another provision of this chapter.

(ii) The requirements of section 1725(c)(3) of this title shall apply with respect to payments made under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

(3) In the case of an eligible individual who receives emergent suicide care under this section and who is entitled to emergent suicide care (or payment for emergent suicide care) under a health-plan contract, the Secretary may recover the costs of such emergent suicide care provided under this section, other than for such care for a service-connected disability.

(4) In carrying out subsection (d), the Secretary may not charge an eligible individual for any cost of emergent suicide care provided under subsection (a) solely by reason of the Secretary not having been notified of such care pursuant to such subsection.
