### CHAPTER 53— SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO BENEFITS
#### § 5314. Indebtedness offsets
###### (b) Deductions may not be made under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the indebtedness of a person described in such subsection unless the Secretary

(1) has made reasonable efforts to notify such person of such person’s right to dispute through prescribed administrative processes the existence or amount of such indebtedness and of such person’s right to request a waiver of such indebtedness under section 5302 of this title ;

(2) has made a determination with respect to any such dispute or request or has determined that the time required to make such a determination before making deductions would jeopardize the Secretary’s ability to recover the full amount of such indebtedness through deductions from such payments; and
