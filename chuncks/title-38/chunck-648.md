#### § 1729. Recovery by the United States of the cost of certain care and services

(a)

(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in any case in which the United States is required by law to furnish or pay for care or services under this chapter for a non-service-connected disability described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States has the right to recover or collect from a third party the reasonable charges of care or services so furnished or paid for to the extent that the recipient or provider of the care or services would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such third party if the care or services had not been furnished or paid for by a department or agency of the United States.

(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a non-service-connected disability

(A) that is incurred incident to the individual’s employment and that is covered under a workers’ compensation law or plan that provides for payment for the cost of health care and services provided to the individual by reason of the disability;

(B) that is incurred as the result of a motor vehicle accident to which applies a State law that requires the owners or operators of motor vehicles registered in that State to have in force automobile accident reparations insurance;

(C) that is incurred as the result of a crime of personal violence that occurred in a State, or a political subdivision of a State, in which a person injured as the result of such a crime is entitled to receive health care and services at such State’s or subdivision’s expense for personal injuries suffered as the result of such crime;

(D) that is incurred by an individual who is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract; or

(E) for which care and services are furnished under this chapter to a veteran who

(i) has a service-connected disability; and

(ii) is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract.

(3) In the case of a health-plan contract that contains a requirement for payment of a deductible or copayment by the individual

(A) the individual’s not having paid such deductible or copayment with respect to care or services furnished under this chapter shall not preclude recovery or collection under this section; and

(B) the amount that the United States may collect or recover under this section shall be reduced by the appropriate deductible or copayment amount, or both.

(b)

(1) As to the right provided in subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the individual (or the individual’s personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) may have against a third party.

(2)

(A) In order to enforce any right or claim to which the United States is subrogated under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the United States may intervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by the individual (or the individual’s personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) against a third party.
