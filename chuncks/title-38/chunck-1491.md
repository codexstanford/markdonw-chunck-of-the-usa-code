### CHAPTER 37— HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS
#### § 3712. Loans to purchase manufactured homes and lots
###### (e) No loan shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless

(1) the loan is repayable in approximately equal monthly installments;

(2) the terms of repayment bear a proper relationship to the veteran’s present and anticipated income and expenses, and the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, as determined in accordance with the regulations prescribed under section 3710(g) of this title and taking into account the purpose of this program to make available lower cost housing to low and lower income veterans, especially those who have been recently discharged or released from active military, naval, air, or space service, who may not have previously established credit ratings;

(3) the loan is secured by a first lien on the manufactured home purchased with the proceeds of the loan and on any lot acquired or improved with the proceeds of the loan;

(4) the amount of the loan to be paid by the veteran is not in excess of the amount determined to be reasonable, based upon

(A) with respect to any portion of the loan to purchase a new manufactured home, such cost factors as the Secretary considers proper to take into account;

(B) with respect to any portion of the loan to purchase a used manufactured home, the reasonable value of the property, as determined by the Secretary;

(C) with respect to any portion of the loan to purchase a lot, the reasonable value of such lot, as determined by the Secretary; and

(D) with respect to any portion of the loan to cover the cost of necessary site preparation, an appropriate amount, as determined by the Secretary;

(5) the veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the veteran will personally occupy the property as the veteran’s home; except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply (A) in the case of a guaranteed loan that is for the purpose described in paragraph (1)(F) of subsection (a), or (B) in the case described in section 3704(c)(2);

(6) the manufactured home is or will be placed on a site which meets specifications which the Secretary shall establish by regulation; and

(7) the interest rate to be charged on the loan does not exceed the permissible rate established by the Secretary.

(f) The Secretary shall establish such rate of interest for manufactured home loans and manufactured home lot loans as the Secretary determines to be necessary in order to assure a reasonable supply of manufactured home loan financing for veterans for purposes specified in this section.

(g) The Secretary shall promulgate such regulations as the Secretary determines to be necessary or appropriate in order to fully implement the provisions of this section, and such regulations may specify which provisions in other sections of this chapter the Secretary determines should be applicable to loans guaranteed or made for purposes specified in this section. The Secretary shall have such powers and responsibilities in respect to matters arising under this section as the Secretary has in respect to loans made or guaranteed or under other sections of this chapter.

(h)

(1) No loan for the purchase of a manufactured home shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless the manufactured home and lot, if any, meet or exceed standards for planning, construction, and general acceptability as prescribed by the Secretary and no loan for the purchase of a lot on which to place a manufactured home owned by a veteran shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless the lot meets such standards prescribed for manufactured home lots. Such standards shall be designed to encourage the maintenance and development of sites for manufactured homes which will be attractive residential areas and which will be free from, and not substantially contribute to, adverse scenic or environmental conditions.

(2) Any manufactured housing unit properly displaying a certification of conformity to all applicable Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards pursuant to section 616 of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 ( 42 U.S.C. 5415 ) shall be deemed to meet the standards required by paragraph (1).

(i) The Secretary shall require the manufacturer to become a warrantor of any new manufactured home which is approved for purchase with financing through the assistance of this chapter and to furnish to the purchaser a written warranty in such form as the Secretary shall require. Such warranty shall include (1) a specific statement that the manufactured home meets the standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section; and (2) a provision that the warrantor’s liability to the purchaser or owner is limited under the warranty to instances of substantial nonconformity to such standards which become evident within one year from date of purchase and as to which the purchaser or owner gives written notice to the warrantor not later than ten days after the end of the warranty period. The warranty prescribed herein shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, all other rights and privileges which such purchaser or owner may have under any other law or instrument and shall so provide in the warranty document.
