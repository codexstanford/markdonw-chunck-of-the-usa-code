#### § 1720D. Counseling and treatment for sexual trauma

(a)

(1) The Secretary shall operate a program under which the Secretary provides counseling and appropriate care and services, to include care for physical health conditions, as appropriate, to former members of the Armed Forces who the Secretary determines require such counseling and care and services to treat a condition, which in the judgment of a health care professional employed by the Department, resulted from a physical assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while the former member of the Armed Forces was serving on duty, regardless of duty status or line of duty determination (as that term is used in section 12323 of title 10 ).

(2)

(A) In operating the program required by paragraph (1), the Secretary may, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, provide counseling and care and services to members of the Armed Forces (including members of the National Guard and Reserves) to treat a condition described in that paragraph that was suffered by the member while serving on duty, regardless of duty status or line of duty determination (as that term is used in section 12323 of title 10 ).

(B) A member described in subparagraph (A) shall not be required to obtain a referral before receiving counseling and care and services under this paragraph.

(3) In furnishing counseling to an individual under this subsection, the Secretary may provide such counseling pursuant to a contract with a qualified mental health professional if (A) in the judgment of a mental health professional employed by the Department, the receipt of counseling by that individual in facilities of the Department would be clinically inadvisable, or (B) Department facilities are not capable of furnishing such counseling to that individual economically because of geographical inaccessibility.

(b)

(1) The Secretary shall give priority to the establishment and operation of the program to provide counseling and care and services under subsection (a). In the case of a former member of the Armed Forces eligible for counseling and care and services under subsection (a), the Secretary shall ensure that the former member of the Armed Forces is furnished counseling and care and services under this section in a way that is coordinated with the furnishing of such care and services under this chapter.

(2) In establishing a program to provide counseling under subsection (a), the Secretary shall

(A) provide for appropriate training of mental health professionals and such other health care personnel as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out the program effectively;

(B) seek to ensure that such counseling is furnished in a setting that is therapeutically appropriate, taking into account the circumstances that resulted in the need for such counseling; and

(C) provide referral services to assist former members of the Armed Forces who are not eligible for services under this chapter to obtain those from sources outside the Department.
