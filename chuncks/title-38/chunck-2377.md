(2) The provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 1927(b)(3) of the Social Security Act shall apply to drugs described in paragraph (1) and the Secretary in the same manner as such provisions apply to covered outpatient drugs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services under such subparagraphs, except that references in such subparagraphs to prices or information reported or required under “subparagraph (A)” shall be deemed to refer to information reported under paragraph (1).

(3) In order to determine the accuracy of a drug price that is reported to the Secretary under paragraph (1), the Secretary may audit the relevant records of the manufacturer or of any wholesaler that distributes the drug, and may delegate the authority to audit such records to the appropriate Federal agency described in subsection (b).

(4) Any information contained in a report submitted to the Secretary under paragraph (1) or obtained by the Secretary through any audit conducted under paragraph (3) shall remain confidential, except as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out this section and to permit the Comptroller General and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to review the information provided.
