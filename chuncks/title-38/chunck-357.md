#### § 1173. Formal evaluation of recommendations
###### (c) Conduct of Evaluations .

(1) The Secretary shall ensure that each formal evaluation under subsection (a)

(A) reviews scientific evidence in a manner that

(i) conforms to principles of scientific and data integrity;

(ii) is free from suppression or distortion of scientific or technological findings, data, information, conclusions, or technical results; and

(B)

(i) evaluates the likelihood that a positive association exists between an illness and a toxic exposure while serving in the active military, naval, air, or space service; and

(ii) assesses the toxic exposures and illnesses and determines whether the evidence supports a finding of a positive association between the toxic exposure and the illness.

(2) In carrying out paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a formal evaluation under subsection (a) shall include reviewing all relevant data to determine the strength of evidence for a positive association based on the following four categories:

(A) The “sufficient” category, where the evidence is sufficient to conclude that a positive association exists.

(B) The “equipoise and above” category, where the evidence is sufficient to conclude that a positive association is at least as likely as not, but not sufficient to conclude that a positive association exists.

(C) The “below equipoise” category, where the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that a positive association is at least as likely as not, or is not sufficient to make a scientifically informed judgment.

(D) The “against” category, where the evidence suggests the lack of a positive association.
