#### § 1720. Transfers for nursing home care; adult day health care

(a)

(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may transfer to a non-Department nursing home, for care at the expense of the United States

(A) a veteran

(i) who has been furnished care by the Secretary in a facility under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary; and

(ii) who the Secretary determines

(I) requires a protracted period of nursing home care which can be furnished in the non-Department nursing home; and

(II) in the case of a veteran who has been furnished hospital care in a facility under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary, has received maximum benefits from such care; and

(B) a member of the Armed Forces

(i) who has been furnished care in a hospital of the Armed Forces;

(ii) who the Secretary concerned determines has received maximum benefits from such care but requires a protracted period of nursing home care; and

(iii) who upon discharge from the Armed Forces will become a veteran.

(2) The Secretary may transfer a person to a nursing home under this subsection only if the Secretary determines that the cost to the United States of the care of such person in the nursing home will not exceed

(A) the amount equal to 45 percent of the cost of care furnished by the Department in a general hospital under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary (as such cost may be determined annually by the Secretary); or

(B) the amount equal to 50 percent of such cost, if such higher amount is determined to be necessary by the Secretary (upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health) to provide adequate care.

(3) Nursing home care may not be furnished under this subsection at the expense of the United States for more than six months in the aggregate in connection with any one transfer except

(A) in the case of a veteran

(i) who is transferred to a non-Department nursing home from a hospital under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary; and

(ii) whose hospitalization was primarily for a service-connected disability;

(B) in a case in which the nursing home care is required for a service-connected disability; or

(C) in a case in which, in the judgment of the Secretary, a longer period of nursing home care is warranted.

(4) A veteran who is furnished care by the Secretary in a hospital or domiciliary facility in Alaska or Hawaii may be furnished nursing home care at the expense of the United States under this subsection even if such hospital or domiciliary facility is not under the direct jurisdiction of the Secretary.

(b) No veteran may be transferred or admitted to any institution for nursing home care under this section, unless such institution is determined by the Secretary to meet such standards as the Secretary may prescribe. The standards prescribed and any report of inspection of institutions furnishing care to veterans under this section made by or for the Secretary shall, to the extent possible, be made available to all Federal, State, and local agencies charged with the responsibility of licensing or otherwise regulating or inspecting such institutions.
