### CHAPTER 6A— EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES
#### § 635i–3. Tied Aid Credit Fund and program
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) tied aid and partially untied aid credits offered by other countries are a predatory method of financing exports because of their market-distorting effects;

(2) these distortions have caused the United States to lose export sales, with resulting losses in economic growth and employment;

(3) these practices undermine market mechanisms that would otherwise result in export purchase decisions made on the basis of price, quality, delivery, and other factors directly related to the export, where official financing is not subsidized and would be a neutral factor in the transaction;

(4) support of commercial exports by donor countries with tied aid and partially untied aid credits impedes the growth of developing countries because it diverts development assistance funds from essential developmental purposes;

(5) the Bank has, at a minimum, the following two tasks

(A)

(i) first, the Bank should match foreign export credit agencies and aid agencies when they engage in tied aid outside the confines of the Arrangement and when they exploit loopholes, such as untied aid;

(ii) such matching is needed to provide the United States with leverage in efforts at the OECD to reduce the overall level of export subsidies;

(iii) only through matching foreign export credit offers can the Bank buttress United States negotiators in their efforts to bring these loopholes within the disciplines of the Arrangement; and

(iv) in order to bring untied aid within the discipline of the Arrangement, the Bank should consider initiating highly competitive financial support when the Bank learns that foreign untied aid offers will be made; and

(B) second, the Bank should support United States exporters when the exporters face foreign competition that is consistent with the Arrangement and the Subsidies Code of the World Trade Organization, but which places United States exporters at a competitive disadvantage; and

(6) there should be established in the Bank a tied aid program to target the export markets of those countries, including those that are not a party to the Arrangement, which make extensive use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits, or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid, for commercial advantage for the purposes of

(A) enforcing compliance with the existing Arrangement restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits for commercial purposes; and

(B) facilitating efforts to negotiate, establish, and enforce new or revised comprehensive international arrangements effectively restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits, or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid, for commercial purposes; and

(C) promoting compliance with Arrangement rules among foreign export credit agencies that are not a party to the Arrangement; and such program should be used aggressively for such purposes.
