### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1823. Corporation monies
##### (h) Reopening or aversion of closing of insured branch of foreign bank

The powers conferred on the Board of Directors and the Corporation by this section to take action to reopen an insured depository institution in default or to avert the default of an insured depository institution may be used with respect to an insured branch of a foreign bank if, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, the public interest in avoiding the default of such branch substantially outweighs any additional risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund which the exercise of such powers would entail.
