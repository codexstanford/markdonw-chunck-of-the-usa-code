(B) the holding company is predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in paragraph (2); and

(C) the company engaged in such activity continues to engage only in the same activities that such company conducted on September 30, 1999 , and other activities permissible under this chapter.

(2) Predominantly financial

For purposes of this subsection, a company is predominantly engaged in financial activities if the annual gross revenues derived by the holding company and all subsidiaries of the holding company (excluding revenues derived from subsidiary depository institutions), on a consolidated basis, from engaging in activities that are financial in nature or are incidental to a financial activity under subsection (k) represent at least 85 percent of the consolidated annual gross revenues of the company.

(3) No expansion of grandfathered commercial activities through merger or consolidation

A financial holding company that engages in activities or holds shares pursuant to this subsection, or a subsidiary of such financial holding company, may not acquire, in any merger, consolidation, or other type of business combination, assets of any other company that is engaged in any activity that the Board has not determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity under subsection (k), except this paragraph shall not apply with respect to a company that owns a broadcasting station licensed under title III of the Communications Act of 1934 [ 47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and the shares of which are under common control with an insurance company since January 1, 1998 , unless such company is acquired by, or otherwise becomes an affiliate of, a bank holding company that, at the time such acquisition or affiliation is consummated, is 1 of the 5 largest domestic bank holding companies (as determined on the basis of the consolidated total assets of such companies).

(4) Continuing revenue limitation on grandfathered commercial activities

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a financial holding company may continue to engage in activities or hold shares in companies pursuant to this subsection only to the extent that the aggregate annual gross revenues derived from all such activities and all such companies does not exceed 15 percent of the consolidated annual gross revenues of the financial holding company (excluding revenues derived from subsidiary depository institutions).

(5) Cross marketing restrictions applicable to commercial activities

(A) In general

A depository institution controlled by a financial holding company shall not

(i) offer or market, directly or through any arrangement, any product or service of a company whose activities are conducted or whose shares are owned or controlled by the financial holding company pursuant to this subsection or subparagraph (H) or (I) of subsection (k)(4); or

(ii) permit any of its products or services to be offered or marketed, directly or through any arrangement, by or through any company described in clause (i).

(B) Rule of construction

Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as prohibiting an arrangement between a depository institution and a company owned or controlled pursuant to subparagraph (H) or (I) of subsection (k)(4) for the marketing of products or services through statement inserts or Internet websites if

(i) such arrangement does not violate section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 [ 12 U.S.C. 1971 et seq.]; and

(ii) the Board determines that the arrangement is in the public interest, does not undermine the separation of banking and commerce, and is consistent with the safety and soundness of depository institutions.

A depository institution controlled by a financial holding company may not engage in a covered transaction (as defined in section 371c(b)(7) of this title ) with any affiliate controlled by the company pursuant to this subsection.

A financial holding company engaged in any activity, or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of shares of a company, pursuant to this subsection, shall terminate such activity and divest ownership or control of the shares of such company before the end of the 10-year period beginning on November 12, 1999 . The Board may, upon application by a financial holding company, extend such 10-year period by a period not to exceed an additional 5 years if such extension would not be detrimental to the public interest.
