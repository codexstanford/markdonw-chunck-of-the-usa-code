(1) Establishment of Advanced Building Technology Council

There is established within the Institute, the Advanced Building Technology Council (hereafter referred to as the “Council”).

(2) Purposes

The Council shall carry out an Advanced Building Technology Program for the purposes of

(A) identifying, selecting, and evaluating existing and new building technologies, including energy cost savings technologies, that conform to recognized performance criteria and meet applicable test standards for maintenance of life, safety, health, and public welfare when used in occupied buildings;

(B) to the extent necessary, developing criteria for the use of such technology;

(C) conducting economic analyses of proposed new technologies when produced and installed in buildings at volumes associated with comparable conventional technologies;

(D) in cooperation with the appropriate Federal agencies, advising building designers, installers, subcontractors, contractors and supervisory officials on the appropriate design and use of new building technology incorporated in federally owned or operated buildings;

(E) in cooperation with the appropriate Federal agencies, monitoring and evaluating the performance of new building technologies for at least 1 year after installation and building occupancy; and

(F) disseminating resulting data to affected parties through automated information management systems.

(3) Council membership

The Council shall be comprised of not less than 6 and not more than 11 members selected by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from among representatives of the various segments of the nationwide building community that have extensive experience in building industries, including, but not limited to

(A) product manufacturers;

(B) experts in the fields of health, fire hazards, and safety; and

(C) independent representatives of the public interest such as architects, professional engineers, and representatives of consumer organizations, except that serving members of the National Institute of Building Sciences Advisory Council shall not be eligible to serve simultaneously on the Council.

(4) Federal participation

(B) Required assurances

Upon agreement between a participating Federal agency and the Council, with respect to the selection of the appropriate technology and the schedule of necessary work, the Council shall

(i) provide the Federal agency with a 5-year guarantee from the technology manufacturer that

(I) all necessary corrections to the technology will be made in the design, installation, and maintenance of the technology;

(II) all malfunctions will be repaired without delay; and

(III) the technology manufacturer will be responsible for removal of the technology in the event of its failure to perform as required;

(ii) provide the Federal agency and its officials responsible for constructing or renovating buildings utilizing the new technology, as well as the designers, installers, subcontractors, and contractors responsible for the design, construction, or renovation of the buildings utilizing such technology with the technical information necessary to ensure its most appropriate use,

(iii) in cooperation with the Federal agency, monitor and evaluate the performance of the new technology, and

(iv) prepare reports to be made available to public agencies at all levels of government, the industry, and the public on the performance of the new technology.

(5) Report to the Institute

The Council shall submit to the Institute annually a description of its activities under the Advanced Building Technology Program for inclusion in the Institute’s annual report to the Congress under subsection (j).
