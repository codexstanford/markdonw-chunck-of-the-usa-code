##### (i) Insurance for accepting and discounting promissory notes; contract provisions; default in payments; remedies; debentures; interest; premium charges

(1) In addition to the insurance of the principal loan to finance the manufacture of housing, as provided in this section, and in order to provide short-term financing in the sale of houses to be delivered pursuant to the purchase contract or contracts assigned as security for such principal loan, the Secretary is authorized, under such terms and conditions and subject to such limitations as he may prescribe, to insure the lender against any losses it may sustain resulting from the acceptance and discount of a promissory note or notes executed by a purchaser of any such houses representing an unpaid portion of the purchase price of any such houses. No such promissory note or notes accepted and discounted by the lender pursuant to this subsection shall involve a principal obligation in excess of 80 per centum of the purchase price of the manufactured house or houses; have a maturity in excess of one hundred and eighty days from the date of the note or bear interest in excess of 4 per centum per annum; nor may the principal amount of such promissory notes, with respect to any individual principal loan, outstanding and unpaid at any one time, exceed in the aggregate an amount prescribed by the Secretary.

(2) The Secretary is authorized to include in any contract of insurance executed by him with respect to the insurance of a loan to finance the manufacture of houses, provisions to effectuate the insurance against any such losses under this subsection.

(3) The failure of the purchaser to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of any note or notes executed by the purchaser and accepted and discounted by the lender under the provisions of this subsection, shall be considered as a default under this subsection, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance, as provided in subsection (d) of this section except that debentures issued pursuant to this subsection shall have a face value equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of default to the date the application is filed for the insurance benefits.

(4) Debentures issued with respect to the insurance granted under this subsection shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of section 1739(d) of this title except that such debentures shall be dated as of the date application is filed for the insurance benefits and shall bear interest from such date.

(5) The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance granted under this subsection, in addition to the premium charge authorized under subsection (h) of this section. Such premium charge shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the original principal of such promissory note or notes and shall be paid at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary.
