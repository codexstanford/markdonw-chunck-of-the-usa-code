### CHAPTER 14— FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS
#### § 1790d. Prompt corrective action
##### (b) Regulations required

(1) Insured credit unions

(A) In general

The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is

(i) consistent with this section; and

(ii) comparable to section 1831 o of this title.

(B) Cooperative character of credit unions

The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that

(i) do not issue capital stock;

(ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and

(iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.

(2) New credit unions

(A) In general

In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).

(B) Criteria for alternative system

The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)

(i) to carry out the purpose of this section;

(ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;

(iii) to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either

(I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or

(II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;

(iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and

(v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.
