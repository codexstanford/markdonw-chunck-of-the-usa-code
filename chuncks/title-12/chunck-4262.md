(A) reducing such matching requirement by 50 percent; or

(B) permitting an applicant to provide matching funds in a form to be determined at the discretion of the Fund, if such applicant

(ii) serves nonmetropolitan or rural areas; and

(iii) is not requesting more than $25,000 in assistance.

(3) Limitation

Not more than 25 percent of the total funds disbursed in any fiscal year by the Fund may be matched as authorized under paragraph (2).
