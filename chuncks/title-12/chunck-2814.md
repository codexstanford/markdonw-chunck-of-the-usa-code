##### (e) Restructuring

(2) Computation of cost of restructuring

In determining whether the potential cost to the qualified lender of restructuring a distressed loan is less than or equal to the potential cost of foreclosure, a qualified lender shall consider all relevant factors, including

(A) the present value of interest income and principal forgone by the lender in carrying out the restructuring plan;

(B) reasonable and necessary administrative expenses involved in working with the borrower to finalize and implement the restructuring plan;

(C) whether the borrower has presented a preliminary restructuring plan and cash-flow analysis taking into account income from all sources to be applied to the debt and all assets to be pledged, showing a reasonable probability that orderly debt retirement will occur as a result of the proposed restructuring; and

(D) whether the borrower has furnished or is willing to furnish complete and current financial statements in a form acceptable to the institution.
