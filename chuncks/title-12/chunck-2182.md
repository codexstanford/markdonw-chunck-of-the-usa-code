The appropriate Federal banking agency shall, not less than once during each 12-month period, conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of each insured depository institution.

(2) Examinations by Corporation

Paragraph (1) shall not apply during any 12-month period in which the Corporation has conducted a full-scope, on-site examination of the insured depository institution.

(3) State examinations acceptable

The examinations required by paragraph (1) may be conducted in alternate 12-month periods, as appropriate, if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that an examination of the insured depository institution conducted by the State during the intervening 12-month period carries out the purpose of this subsection.

(4) 18-month rule for certain small institutions

Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall apply with “18-month” substituted for “12-month” if

(A) the insured depository institution has total assets of less than $3,000,000,000;

(B) the institution is well capitalized, as defined in section 1831 o of this title;

(C) when the institution was most recently examined, it was found to be well managed, and its composite condition

(D) the insured institution is not currently subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or order by the Corporation or the appropriate Federal banking agency; and

(E) no person acquired control of the institution during the 12-month period in which a full-scope, on-site examination would be required but for this paragraph.

(5) Certain Government-controlled institutions exempted

Paragraph (1) does not apply to

(A) any institution for which the Corporation is conservator; or

(B) any bridge depository institution, none of the voting securities of which are owned by a person or agency other than the Corporation.

(6) Coordinated examinations

To minimize the disruptive effects of examinations on the operations of insured depository institutions

(A) each appropriate Federal banking agency shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with principles of safety and soundness and the public interest

(i) coordinate examinations to be conducted by that agency at an insured depository institution and its affiliates;

(ii) coordinate with the other appropriate Federal banking agencies in the conduct of such examinations;

(iii) work to coordinate with the appropriate State bank supervisor

(I) the conduct of all examinations made pursuant to this subsection; and

(II) the number, types, and frequency of reports required to be submitted to such agencies and supervisors by insured depository institutions, and the type and amount of information required to be included in such reports; and

(iv) use copies of reports of examinations of insured depository institutions made by any other Federal banking agency or appropriate State bank supervisor to eliminate duplicative requests for information; and

(B) not later than 2 years after September 23, 1994 , the Federal banking agencies shall jointly establish and implement a system for determining which one of the Federal banking agencies or State bank supervisors shall be the lead agency responsible for managing a unified examination of each insured depository institution and its affiliates, as required by this subsection.

(7) Separate examinations permitted

Notwithstanding paragraph (6), each appropriate Federal banking agency may conduct a separate examination in an emergency or under other exigent circumstances, or when the agency believes that a violation of law may have occurred.

(8) Report

At the time the system provided for in paragraph (6) is established, the Federal banking agencies shall submit a joint report describing the system to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives. Thereafter, the Federal banking agencies shall annually submit a joint report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives regarding the progress of the agencies in implementing the system and indicating areas in which enhancements to the system, including legislature improvements, would be appropriate.

(9) Standards for determining adequacy of State examinations

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council shall issue guidelines establishing standards to be used at the discretion of the appropriate Federal banking agency for purposes of making a determination under paragraph (3).

(10) Agencies authorized to increase maximum asset amount of institutions for certain purposes

At any time after the end of the 2-year period beginning on September 23, 1994 , the appropriate Federal banking agency, in the agency’s discretion, may increase the maximum amount limitation contained in paragraph (4)(C)(ii), by regulation, from $200,000,000 to an amount not to exceed $3,000,000,000 for purposes of such paragraph, if the agency determines that the greater amount would be consistent with the principles of safety and soundness for insured depository institutions.
