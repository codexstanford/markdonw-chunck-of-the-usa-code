### CHAPTER 42— LOW-INCOME HOUSING PRESERVATION AND RESIDENT HOMEOWNERSHIP
#### § 4113. Assistance for displaced tenants
##### (c) Continued occupancy

(1) In general

Each owner that prepays the mortgage (or terminates the mortgage insurance contract) on eligible low-income housing shall, as provided in paragraph (3), allow the tenants occupying units in such housing on the date of the submission of notice of intent under section 4102 of this title to remain in the housing for a period of 3 years, at rent levels (except for increases necessary for increased operating costs) existing at the time of prepayment.

(2) Provision of assistance by owner

In any case in which the Secretary requires an owner to allow tenants to occupy units under paragraph (1), an owner may fulfill the requirements of such paragraph by providing such assistance necessary for the tenant to rent a decent, safe, and sanitary unit in another project for the same period and at a rental cost to the tenant not in excess of the rental amount the tenant would have been required to pay in the housing of the owner, except that the tenant must freely agree to waive the right to occupy the unit in the owner’s housing.

(3) Applicability to low-vacancy areas and special needs tenants

The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to

(A) eligible low income housing located in a low-vacancy area (as such term is defined by the Secretary); and

(B) tenants in any eligible low-income housing in any area who have special needs restricting their ability to relocate (including elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities), as determined under regulations established by the Secretary.
