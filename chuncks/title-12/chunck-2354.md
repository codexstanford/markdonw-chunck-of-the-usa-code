### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1831f. Brokered deposits
##### (d) Limited exception for certain conservatorships

In the case of any insured depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed as conservator, subsection (a) shall not apply to the acceptance of deposits (described in such subsection) by such institution if the Corporation determines that the acceptance of such deposits

(1) is not an unsafe or unsound practice;

(2) is necessary to enable the institution to meet the demands of its depositors or pay its obligations in the ordinary course of business; and

(3) is consistent with the conservator’s fiduciary duty to minimize the institution’s losses. Effective 90 days after the date on which the institution was placed in conservatorship, the institution may not accept such deposits.
