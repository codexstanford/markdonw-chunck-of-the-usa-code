The aggregate amount that may be obligated over the duration of the contracts entered into with the authority provided on or after October 1, 1983 (other than obligations in connection with mortgages insured under subsection (r)), may not exceed such sums of new budget authority as may be appropriated after November 30, 1983 . The Secretary shall begin issuing new commitments and reservations to provide mortgage insurance and assistance payments under this section before the expiration of the 30-day period following the approval in any appropriation Act of budget authority for this section after November 30, 1983 . Upon the expiration of one year following August 22, 1974 , the Secretary shall not enter into new contracts for assistance payments under this section utilizing authority approved in appropriation Acts prior to July 1, 1974 . The Secretary shall not enter into new contracts for assistance payments under this section (except under subsection (r)) after May 20, 1983 , utilizing amounts approved in appropriation Acts before November 30, 1983 , except (i) pursuant to a firm commitment issued on or before May 20, 1983 , (ii) pursuant to other commitments issued by the Secretary prior to June 30, 1981 , reserving funds for housing to be assisted under this section  where  such  housing  is  included  in  a project pursuant to section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [ 42 U.S.C. 5318 ], or (iii) pursuant to other commitments issued on or before September 30, 1981 , where housing under this section is to be developed on land which was municipally owned on September 30, 1981 , and where a local government contributes at least $1,000 per unit of funds obtained under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [ 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] and at least $2,000 per unit of additional funds to assist housing under this section.

(2) Assistance payments under this section may be made only with respect to a family whose income at the time of initial occupancy does not exceed 95 per centum of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 95 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low median family incomes, or other factors.

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(2) and (i)(3)(A) with respect to the prior construction or rehabilitation of a dwelling, or of the project in which there is a dwelling unit, for which assistance payments may be made, and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (j)(1) authorizing the purchase of housing which is neither deteriorating nor substandard, not more than
