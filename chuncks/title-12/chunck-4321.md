### CHAPTER 47— COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BANKING
#### § 4719. Grants to establish loan-loss reserve funds
##### (a) Purposes

The purposes of this section are

(1) to make financial assistance available from the Fund in order to help community development financial institutions defray the costs of operating small dollar loan programs, by providing the amounts necessary for such institutions to establish their own loan loss reserve funds to mitigate some of the losses on such small dollar loan programs; and

(2) to encourage community development financial institutions to establish and maintain small dollar loan programs that would help give consumers access to mainstream financial institutions and combat high cost small dollar lending.
