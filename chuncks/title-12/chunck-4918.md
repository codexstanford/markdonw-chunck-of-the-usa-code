### CHAPTER 53— WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
#### § 5464. Standards for systemically important financial market utilities and payment, clearing, or settlement activities
##### (a) Authority to prescribe standards

(1) Board of Governors

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Board of Governors, by rule or order, and in consultation with the Council and the Supervisory Agencies, shall prescribe risk management standards, taking into consideration relevant international standards and existing prudential requirements, governing

(A) the operations related to the payment, clearing, and settlement activities of designated financial market utilities; and

(B) the conduct of designated activities by financial institutions.

(2) Special procedures for designated clearing entities and designated activities of certain financial institutions

(A) CFTC and Commission

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Commission may each prescribe regulations, in consultation with the Council and the Board of Governors, containing risk management standards, taking into consideration relevant international standards and existing prudential requirements, for those designated clearing entities and financial institutions engaged in designated activities for which each is the Supervisory Agency or the appropriate financial regulator, governing

(i) the operations related to payment, clearing, and settlement activities of such designated clearing entities; and

(ii) the conduct of designated activities by such financial institutions.

(B) Review and determination

The Board of Governors may determine that existing prudential requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Commission, or both (including requirements prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (A)) with respect to designated clearing entities and financial institutions engaged in designated activities for which the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the Supervisory Agency or the appropriate financial regulator are insufficient to prevent or mitigate significant liquidity, credit, operational, or other risks to the financial markets or to the financial stability of the United States.

(C) Written determination

Any determination by the Board of Governors under subparagraph (B) shall be provided in writing to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Commission, as applicable, and the Council, and shall explain why existing prudential requirements, considered as a whole, are insufficient to ensure that the operations and activities of the designated clearing entities or the activities of financial institutions described in subparagraph (B) will not pose significant liquidity, credit, operational, or other risks to the financial markets or to the financial stability of the United States. The Board of Governors’ determination shall contain a detailed analysis supporting its findings and identify the specific prudential requirements that are insufficient.

(D) CFTC and Commission response

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Commission, as applicable, shall within 60 days either object to the Board of Governors’ determination with a detailed analysis as to why existing prudential requirements are sufficient, or submit an explanation to the Council and the Board of Governors describing the actions to be taken in response to the Board of Governors’ determination.

(E) Authorization

Upon an affirmative vote by not fewer than 2/3 of members then serving on the Council, the Council shall either find that the response submitted under subparagraph (D) is sufficient, or require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the Commission, as applicable, to prescribe such risk management standards as the Council determines is necessary to address the specific prudential requirements that are determined to be insufficient.”  1
