### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1709. Insurance of mortgages
##### (g) Limitation on use of single family mortgage insurance by investors

(1) The Secretary may insure a mortgage under this subchapter that is secured by a 1- to 4-family dwelling, or approve a substitute mortgagor with respect to any such mortgage, only if the mortgagor is to occupy the dwelling as his or her principal residence or as a secondary residence, as determined by the Secretary. In making this determination with respect to the occupancy of secondary residences, the Secretary may not insure mortgages with respect to such residences unless the Secretary determines that it is necessary to avoid undue hardship to the mortgagor. In no event may a secondary residence under this subsection include a vacation home, as determined by the Secretary.

(2) The occupancy requirement established in paragraph (1) shall not apply to any mortgagor (or co-mortgagor, as appropriate) that is

(A) a public entity, as provided in section 1715d or 1715z–12 of this title, or any other State or local government or an agency thereof;

(B) a private nonprofit or public entity, as provided in section 1715 l (h) or 1715z(j) of this title, or other private nonprofit organization that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of title 26 and intends to sell or lease the mortgaged property to low or moderate-income persons, as determined by the Secretary;

(C) an Indian tribe, as provided in section 1715z–13 of this title ;

(D) a serviceperson who is unable to meet such requirement because of his or her duty assignment, as provided in section 1715g of this title or subsection (b)(4) or (f) of section 1715m  1 of this title;

(E) a mortgagor or co-mortgagor under subsection (k); or

(F) a mortgagor that, pursuant to section 1715n(a)(7) of this title , is refinancing an existing mortgage insured under this chapter for not more than the outstanding balance of the existing mortgage, if the amount of the monthly payment due under the refinancing mortgage is less than the amount due under the existing mortgage for the month in which the refinancing mortgage is executed.

(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term “substitute mortgagor” means a person who, upon the release by a mortgagee of a previous mortgagor from personal liability on the mortgage note, assumes such liability and agrees to pay the mortgage debt.
