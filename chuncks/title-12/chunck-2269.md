##### (h) Penalty for failure to timely pay assessments

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (3), any insured depository institution which fails or refuses to pay any assessment shall be subject to a penalty in an amount of not more than 1 percent of the amount of the assessment due for each day that such violation continues.

(2) Exception in case of dispute

Paragraph (1) shall not apply if

(A) the failure to pay an assessment is due to a dispute between the insured depository institution and the Corporation over the amount of such assessment; and

(B) the insured depository institution deposits security satisfactory to the Corporation for payment upon final determination of the issue.

(3) Special rule for small assessment amounts

If the amount of the assessment which an insured depository institution fails or refuses to pay is less than $10,000 at the time of such failure or refusal, the amount of any penalty to which such institution is subject under paragraph (1) shall not exceed $100 for each day that such violation continues.

(4) Authority to modify or remit penalty

The Corporation, in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may compromise, modify or remit any penalty which the Corporation may assess or has already assessed under paragraph (1) upon a finding that good cause prevented the timely payment of an assessment.
