### CHAPTER 55— ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE (LIBOR)
#### § 5803. LIBOR contracts
##### (e) Adjustment by Board

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraph (2), on the LIBOR replacement date, the Board shall adjust the Board-selected benchmark replacement for each category of LIBOR contract that the Board may identify to include the relevant tenor spread adjustment.

(2) Consumer loans

For LIBOR contracts that are consumer loans, the Board shall adjust the Board-selected benchmark replacement as follows:

(A) During the 1-year period beginning on the LIBOR replacement date, incorporate an amount, to be determined for any business day during that period, that transitions linearly from the difference between the Board-selected benchmark replacement and the corresponding LIBOR tenor determined as of the day immediately before the LIBOR replacement date to the relevant tenor spread adjustment.

(B) On and after the date that is 1 year after the LIBOR replacement date, incorporate the relevant tenor spread adjustment.
