#### § 4547. Enterprise guarantee fees
##### (b) Increase

(1) In general

(A) Phased increase required

Subject to subsection (c), the Director shall require each enterprise to charge a guarantee fee in connection with any guarantee of the timely payment of principal and interest on securities, notes, and other obligations based on or backed by mortgages on residential real properties designed principally for occupancy of from 1 to 4 families, consummated after December 23, 2011 .

(B) Amount

The amount of the increase required under this section shall be determined by the Director to appropriately reflect the risk of loss, as well  1 the cost of capital allocated to similar assets held by other fully private regulated financial institutions, but such amount shall be not less than an average increase of 10 basis points for each origination year or book year above the average fees imposed in 2011 for such guarantees. The Director shall prohibit an enterprise from offsetting the cost of the fee to mortgage originators, borrowers, and investors by decreasing other charges, fees, or premiums, or in any other manner.

(2) Authority to limit offer of guarantee

The Director shall prohibit an enterprise from consummating any offer for a guarantee to a lender for mortgage-backed securities, if

(A) the guarantee is inconsistent with the requirements of this section; or

(B) the risk of loss is allowed to increase, through lowering of the underwriting standards or other means, for the primary purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.

(3) Deposit in Treasury

Amounts received from fee increases imposed under this section shall be deposited directly into the United States Treasury, and shall be available only to the extent provided in subsequent appropriations Acts. The fees charged pursuant to this section shall not be considered a reimbursement to the Federal Government for the costs or subsidy provided to an enterprise.
