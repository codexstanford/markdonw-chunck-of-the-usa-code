##### (c) Applicability to loan, mortgage, credit sale, or advance secured by first lien on residential manufactured home

The provisions of subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to a loan, mortgage, credit sale, or advance which is secured by a first lien on a residential manufactured home unless the terms and conditions relating to such loan, mortgage, credit sale, or advance comply with consumer protection provisions specified in regulations prescribed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

(4) include such other provisions as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may prescribe after a finding that additional protections are required.
