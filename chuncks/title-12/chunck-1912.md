Except for those loans or lines of credit required to be approved by the board of directors in section 1757(5) of this title , approval of an application shall be by majority of the committee who are present at the meeting at which it is considered provided that a majority of the full committee is present. The credit committee may appoint and delegate to loan officers the authority to approve applications.
