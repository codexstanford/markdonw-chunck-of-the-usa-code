##### (q) Periodic assistance payments for emergency stimulation of housing market; contracts, terms and conditions, eligibility, etc., for payments

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, except subsection (n), if the Secretary determines that there is a substantial need for emergency stimulation of the housing market, the Secretary is authorized to make and enter into contracts to make periodic assistance payments, to the extent of not to exceed 75 per centum of the authority available pursuant to subsection (h)(1), on behalf of homeowners, including owners of manufactured homes, to mortgagees or other lenders holding mortgages, loans, or advances of credit which meet the requirements of this subsection. The Secretary may establish such criteria, terms, and conditions relating to homeowners and mortgages, loans, or advances of credit assisted under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate, consistent with the provisions of this subsection. The Secretary is authorized to insure a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is to be assisted under this subsection. The authority to enter into contracts to provide assistance payments and to insure mortgages under this subsection shall terminate on September 30, 1989 , or at such earlier date as the Secretary may deem appropriate, upon a determination by the Secretary that the conditions which gave rise to the exercise of authority under this subsection are no longer present, except pursuant to a commitment entered into prior to such date.

(2) Payments under this subsection may be made only on behalf of a homeowner who satisfies such eligibility requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary and who

(A)

(i) is a mortgagor under a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is insured under this subsection, or (ii) is the original owner of a new manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which the manufactured home is situated, where insurance under section 1703 of this title covering the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing such loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of such manufactured home and lot has been granted to the lender making such loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation; and

(B) has a family income, at the time of initial occupancy, which does not exceed 130 per centum of the area median income for the area (with adjustments for smaller and larger families, unusually high or low median family income, or other factors), as determined by the Secretary.

(3) Assistance payments to a mortgagee or other lender by the Secretary on behalf of a homeowner shall be made only during such time as the homeowner shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit. The Secretary may, where a mortgage insured under this subsection has been assigned to the Secretary, continue making such assistance payments.

(4) The amount of the assistance payments in the case of a mortgage shall not at any time exceed the lesser of

(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying a minimum of 25 per centum of the mortgagor’s income, except that the Secretary may reduce such per centum of income to the extent he deems necessary, but not lower than 20 per centum of the mortgagor’s income; or

(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance premium which would be required if the mortgage were a level payment mortgage bearing interest at a rate equal to the maximum interest rate which is applicable to level payment mortgages insured under section 1709(b) of this title , other than mortgages subject to section 1709–1(2)  1 of this title, and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were a level payment mortgage bearing interest at the rate of at least 9½ per centum per annum.

(5) Assistance payments on behalf of the owner of a manufactured home shall not at any time exceed the lesser of

(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying a minimum of 25 per centum of the manufactured homeowner’s income, except that the Secretary may reduce such per centum of income to the extent he deems necessary, but not lower than 20 per centum of the mortgagor’s income; or

(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear an interest rate determined by the Secretary which shall not be less than 12 per centum per annum.

(6) The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee or other lender such amount, in addition to the amount computed under paragraph (4) or (5), as the Secretary deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee or other lender for its reasonable and necessary expenses in handling the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit.

(7) The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not greater than the appraised value as determined by the Secretary.

(8) Assistance payments pursuant to paragraph (5) shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this subsection.

(9) The Secretary may, in addition to mortgages insured under subsection (i) or (j), insure, upon application by the mortgagee, a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who meets the eligibility requirements for assistance payments prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (2). Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(A) be a first lien on real estate held in fee simple, or on a leasehold under a lease which meets terms and conditions established by the Secretary;

(B) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;

(C) involve a one- to four-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary prior to the beginning of construction, or if not so approved, has been completed within one year prior to the filing of the application for insurance and which has never been sold other than to the mortgagor;

(D) involve a principal residence the sales price of which does not exceed 82 per centum of the applicable maximum principal obligation of a mortgage which may be insured in the area pursuant to section 1709(b)(2) of this title , determined without regard to the last sentence of such section;

(F) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance, and service charges if any) at not to exceed the applicable maximum rate for mortgages insured pursuant to section 1709(b) of this title ;

(G) be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid in cash or its equivalent, on account of the property, at least an amount equal to 3 per centum of the Secretary’s estimate of the cost of acquisition; and

(H) contain such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(11) The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, insure mortgages under this subsection which are secured by properties which contribute to the conservation of land and energy resources.

(12) A mortgage to be assisted under this subsection shall, where the Secretary deems it appropriate, provide for graduated payments pursuant to section 1715z–10  1 of this title.

(13) The Secretary shall develop and utilize a system to allocate assistance under this subsection in a manner which assures a reasonable distribution of such assistance among the various regions of the country and which takes into consideration such factors as population, relative decline in building permits, the need for increased housing production, and other factors he deems appropriate. Assistance provided under this subsection shall not be subject to section 1439 of title 42 .

(14) Upon the disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this subsection, or where the homeowner rents the property (or the owner’s unit in the case of a two- to four-family residence) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount of assistance actually received under this subsection, other than any amount provided under paragraph (6), or (B) an amount at least equal to 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “net appreciation of the property” means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage balance as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z–10  1 of this title. In providing for such recapture, the Secretary shall include incentives for the homeowner to maintain the property in a marketable condition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.

(15) Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertification of the homeowner’s income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of such assistance payments within the limits of the formula described in paragraph (4) or (5).
