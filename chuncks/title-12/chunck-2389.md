#### § 1831m. Early identification of needed improvements in financial management
##### (i) Requirements for insured subsidiaries of holding companies

(1) In general

Except with respect to any audit requirements established under or pursuant to subsection (d), the requirements of this section may be satisfied for insured depository institutions that are subsidiaries of a holding company, if

(A) services and functions comparable to those required under this section are provided at the holding company level; and

(B) the institution

(i) has total assets, as of the beginning of such fiscal year, of less than $5,000,000,000; or

(ii) has

(I) total assets, as of the beginning of such fiscal year, of $5,000,000,000, or more; and

(II) a CAMEL composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an equivalent rating by any such agency under a comparable rating system) as of the most recent examination of such institution by the Corporation or the appropriate Federal banking agency.

(2) Large institutions

For purposes of this subsection, in the case of an insured depository institution described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii) that the Corporation determines to be a large institution, the audit committee of the holding company of such an institution shall not include any large customers of the institution.

(3) Applicability based on risk to fund

The appropriate Federal banking agency may require an institution with total assets in excess of $9,000,000,000 to comply with this section, notwithstanding the exemption provided by this subsection, if it determines that such exemption would create a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund if applied to that institution.
