#### § 1787. Payment of insurance
##### (n) Withholding of payment due to liability of credit union member

The Board may withhold payment of such portion of the insured account of any member of a closed credit union as may be required to provide for the payment of any direct or indirect liability of such member to the closed credit union or its liquidating agent, which is not offset against a claim due from such credit union, pending the determination and payment of such liability by such member or any other person liable therefor.
