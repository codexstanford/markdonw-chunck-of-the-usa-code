#### § 2279aa–6. Guarantee of qualified loans
##### (b) Other responsibilities of and limitations on certified facilities

As a condition for providing any guarantees under this section for securities issued by a certified facility that represent interests in, or obligations backed by, any pool of qualified loans, the Corporation shall require such facility to agree to comply with the following requirements:

(1) Loan default resolution

The facility shall act in accordance with the standards of a prudent institutional lender to resolve loan defaults.

(2) Subrogation of United States and Corporation to interests of facility

The proceeds of any collateral, judgments, settlements, or guarantees received by the facility with respect to any loan in such pool, shall be applied, after payment of costs of collection

(A) first, to reduce the amount of any principal outstanding on any obligation of the Corporation that was purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 2279aa–13 of this title to the extent the proceeds of such obligation were used to make guarantees in connection with such securities; and

(B) second, to reimburse the Corporation for any such guarantee payments.

(3) Loan servicing

The originator of any loan in such pool shall be permitted to retain the right to service the loan.

(4) Minority participation in public offerings

The facility shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that minority owned or controlled investment banking firms, underwriters, and bond counsels throughout the United States have an opportunity to participate to a significant degree in any public offering of securities.

(5) No discrimination against States with borrowers rights

The facility may not refuse to purchase qualified loans originating in States that have established borrowers rights laws either by statute or under the constitution of such States, except that the facility may require discounts or charge fees reasonably related to costs and expenses arising from such statutes or constitutional provisions.
