### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1701z–11. Management and disposition of multifamily housing projects
##### (f) Discretionary assistance

In addition to the actions required under subsection (e) for a subsidized, formerly subsidized, or unsubsidized multifamily housing project, the Secretary may, pursuant to the disposition plan and the goals in subsection (a), take one or more of the following actions:

(1) Discounted sales price

In accordance with the authority provided under the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], the Secretary may reduce the selling price of the project. Such reduced sales price shall be reasonably related to the intended use of the property after sale, any rehabilitation requirements for the project, the rents for units in the project that can be supported by the market, the amount of rental assistance available for the project under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ], the occupancy profile of the project (including family size and income levels for tenant families), and any other factors that the Secretary considers appropriate.

(2) Use and rent restrictions

The Secretary may require certain units in a project to be subject to use or rent restrictions providing that such units will be available to and affordable by low- and very low-income persons for the remaining useful life of the property, as defined by the Secretary.

(3) Short-term loans

The Secretary may provide short-term loans to facilitate the sale of a multifamily housing project if

(A) authority for such loans is provided in advance in an appropriation Act;

(B) such loan has a term of not more than 5 years;

(C) the Secretary determines, based upon documentation provided to the Secretary, that the borrower has obtained a commitment of permanent financing to replace the short-term loan from a lender who meets standards established by the Secretary; and

(D) the terms of such loan are consistent with prevailing practices in the marketplace or the provision of such loan results in no cost to the Government, as defined in section 661a of title 2 .

(4) Up-front grants

If the Secretary determines that action under this paragraph is more cost-effective than establishing rents pursuant to subsection (h)(2), the Secretary may utilize the budget authority provided for contracts issued under this section for project-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ] to (in addition to providing project-based section 8 rental assistance) provide up-front grants for the necessary cost of rehabilitation and other related development costs. This paragraph shall be effective during fiscal years 2006 through 2010 only to the extent that such budget authority is made available for use under this paragraph in advance in appropriation Acts.

(5) Tenant-based assistance

The Secretary may make available tenant-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to families residing in a multifamily housing project that do not otherwise qualify for project-based assistance.

(6) Alternative uses

(A) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after providing notice to and an opportunity for comment by preexisting tenants, the Secretary may allow not more than

(i) 10 percent of the total number of units in multifamily housing projects that are disposed of by the Secretary during any fiscal year to be made available for uses other than rental or cooperative uses, including low-income homeownership opportunities, or in any particular project, community space, office space for tenant or housing-related service providers or security programs, or small business uses, if such uses benefit the tenants of the project; and

(ii) 5 percent of the total number of units in multifamily housing projects that are disposed of by the Secretary during any fiscal year to be used in any manner, if the Secretary and the unit of general local government or area-wide governing body determine that such use will further fair housing, community development, or neighborhood revitalization goals.

(B) Displacement protection

The Secretary may take actions under subparagraph (A) only if

(i) tenant-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ] is made available to each eligible family residing in the project that is displaced as a result of such actions; and

(ii) the Secretary determines that sufficient habitable, affordable rental housing is available in the market area in which the project is located to ensure use of such assistance.

(7) Transfer for use under other programs of Secretary

(A) In general

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e), the Secretary may, pursuant to an agreement under subparagraph (B), transfer a multifamily housing project

(i) to a public housing agency for use of the project as public housing; or

(ii) to an entity eligible to own or operate housing assisted under section 1701q of this title or under section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [ 42 U.S.C. 8013 ] for use as supportive housing under either of such sections.

(B) Requirements for agreement

An agreement providing for the transfer of a project described in subparagraph (A) shall

(i) contain such terms, conditions, and limitations as the Secretary determines appropriate, including requirements to ensure use of the project as public housing, supportive housing under section 1701q of this title , or supportive housing under section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [ 42 U.S.C. 8013 ], as applicable; and

(ii) ensure that no tenant of the project will be displaced as a result of actions taken under this paragraph.

(8) Rebuilding

Notwithstanding any provision of section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ], the Secretary may provide project-based assistance in accordance with subsection (e) of this section to support the rebuilding of a multifamily housing project rebuilt or to be rebuilt (in whole or in part and on-site, off-site, or in a combination of both) in connection with disposition under this section, if the Secretary determines that

(A) the project is not being maintained in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition;

(B) rebuilding the project would be less expensive than substantial rehabilitation;

(C) the unit of general local government in which the project is located approves the rebuilding and makes a financial contribution or other commitment to the project; and

(D) the rebuilding is a part of a local neighborhood revitalization plan approved by the unit of general local government. The provisions of subsection (j)(2) shall apply to any tenants of the project who are displaced.

(9) Emergency assistance funds

The Secretary may make arrangements with State agencies and units of general local government of States receiving emergency assistance under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] for the provision of assistance under such Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] on behalf of eligible families who would reside in any multifamily housing projects.
