##### (c) Deposit with National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; amount, return, distribution, etc.
######### (iii) Periodic adjustment .

The amount of each insured credit union’s deposit shall be adjusted as follows, in accordance with procedures determined by the Board, to reflect changes in the credit union’s insured shares:

(I) annually, in the case of an insured credit union with total assets of not more than $50,000,000; and

(II) semi-annually, in the case of an insured credit union with total assets of $50,000,000 or more.

(B)

(i) The deposit shall be returned to an insured credit union in the event that its insurance coverage is terminated, it converts to insurance coverage from another source, or in the event the operations of the fund are transferred from the National Credit Union Administration Board.

(ii) The deposit shall be returned in accordance with procedures and valuation methods determined by the Board, but in no event shall the deposit be returned any later than one year after the final date on which no shares of the credit union are insured by the Board.

(iii) The deposit shall not be returned in the event of liquidation on account of bankruptcy or insolvency.

(iv) The deposit funds may be used by the fund if necessary to meet its expenses, in which case the amount so used shall be expensed and shall be replenished by insured credit unions in accordance with procedures established by the Board.

(2) Insurance premium charges.

(A) In general .

Each insured credit union shall, at such times as the Board prescribes (but not more than twice in any calendar year), pay to the Fund a premium charge for insurance in an amount stated as a percentage of insured shares (which shall be the same for all insured credit unions).

(B) Relation of premium charge to equity ratio of Fund .

The Board may assess a premium charge only if

(i) the Fund’s equity ratio is less than 1.3 percent; and

(ii) the premium charge does not exceed the amount necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.3 percent.

(C) Premium charge required if equity ratio falls below 1.2 percent .

If the Fund’s equity ratio is less than 1.2 percent, the Board shall, subject to subparagraph (B), assess a premium charge in such an amount as the Board determines to be necessary to restore the equity ratio to, and maintain that ratio at, 1.2 percent.

(D) Fund restoration plans.

(i) In general .

Whenever

(I) the Board projects that the equity ratio of the Fund will, within 6 months of such determination, fall below the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (C); or

(II) the equity ratio of the Fund actually falls below the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (C) without any determination under sub-clause (I) having been made, the Board shall establish and implement a restoration plan within 90 days that meets the requirements of clause (ii) and such other conditions as the Board determines to be appropriate.

(ii) Requirements of restoration plan .

A restoration plan meets the requirements of this clause if the plan provides that the equity ratio of the Fund will meet or exceed the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (C) before the end of the 8-year period beginning upon the implementation of the plan (or such longer period as the Board may determine to be necessary due to extraordinary circumstances).

(iii) Transparency .

Not more than 30 days after the Board establishes and implements a restoration plan under clause (i), the Board shall publish in the Federal Register a detailed analysis of the factors considered and the basis for the actions taken with regard to the plan.

(3) Distributions from Fund required.

(A) In general .

The Board shall, subject to the requirements of section 1790e(e) of this title , effect a pro rata distribution to insured credit unions after each calendar year if, as of the end of that calendar year

(i) any loans to the Fund from the Federal Government, and any interest on those loans, have been repaid;

(ii) the Fund’s equity ratio exceeds the normal operating level; and

(iii) the Fund’s available assets ratio exceeds 1.0 percent.

(B) Amount of distribution .

The Board shall distribute under subparagraph (A) the maximum possible amount that

(i) does not reduce the Fund’s equity ratio below the normal operating level; and

(ii) does not reduce the Fund’s available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.

(C) Calculation based on certified statements .

In calculating the Fund’s equity ratio and available assets ratio for purposes of this paragraph, the Board shall determine the aggregate amount of the insured shares in all insured credit unions from insured credit unions certified statements under subsection (b) for the final reporting period of the calendar year referred to in subparagraph (A).

(4) Timeliness and accuracy of data .

In calculating the available assets ratio and equity ratio of the Fund, the Board shall use the most current and accurate data reasonably available.
