### CHAPTER 42— LOW-INCOME HOUSING PRESERVATION AND RESIDENT HOMEOWNERSHIP
#### § 4103. Appraisal and preservation value of eligible low-income housing
##### (c) Guidelines

The Secretary shall provide written guidelines for appraisals of preservation value, which shall assume repayment of the existing federally assisted mortgage, termination of the existing low-income affordability restrictions, simultaneous termination of any Federal rental assistance, and costs of compliance with any State or local laws of general applicability. The guidelines may permit reliance upon assessments of rehabilitation needs and other conversion costs determined by an appropriate State agency, as determined by the Secretary. The guidelines shall instruct the appraiser to use the greater of actual project operating expenses at the time of the appraisal (based on the average of the actual project operating expenses during the preceding 3 years) or projected operating expenses after conversion in determining preservation value. The guidelines established by the Secretary shall not be inconsistent with customary appraisal standards. The guidelines shall also meet the following requirements:

(1) Residential rental value

In the case of preservation value determined under subsection (b)(1), the guidelines shall assume conversion of the housing to market-rate rental housing and shall establish methods for (A) determining rehabilitation expenditures that would be necessary to bring the housing up to quality standards required to attract and sustain a market rate tenancy upon conversion, and (B) assessing other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to market-rate multifamily rental housing.

(2) Highest and best use value

In the case of preservation value determined under subsection (b)(2), the guidelines shall assume conversion of the housing to highest and best use for the property and shall establish methods for (A) determining any rehabilitation expenditures that would be necessary to convert the housing to such use, and (B) assessing other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to its highest and best use.
