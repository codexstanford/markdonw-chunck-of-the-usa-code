### CHAPTER 12— SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS
#### § 1464. Federal savings associations
##### (s) Minimum capital requirements

(1) In general

Consistent with the purposes of section 908 of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 [ 12 U.S.C. 3907 ] and the capital requirements established pursuant to such section by the appropriate Federal banking agencies (as defined in section 903(1) of such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3902(1) ]), the Comptroller of the Currency shall require all savings associations to achieve and maintain adequate capital by

(A) establishing minimum levels of capital for savings associations; and

(B) using such other methods as the Comptroller of the Currency determines to be appropriate.

(2) Minimum capital levels may be determined by Comptroller of the Currency case-by-case

The Comptroller of the Currency may, consistent with subsection (t), establish the minimum level of capital for a savings association at such amount or at such ratio of capital-to-assets as the Comptroller of the Currency determines to be necessary or appropriate for such association in light of the particular circumstances of the association.

(3) Unsafe or unsound practice

In the discretion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the appropriate Federal banking agency, 6 may treat the failure of any savings association to maintain capital at or above the minimum level required by the Comptroller under this subsection or subsection (t) as an unsafe or unsound practice.

(4) Directive to increase capital

(A) Plan may be required

In addition to any other action authorized by law, including paragraph (3), the appropriate Federal banking agency may issue a directive requiring any savings association which fails to maintain capital at or above the minimum level required by the appropriate Federal banking agency to submit and adhere to a plan for increasing capital which is acceptable to the appropriate Federal banking agency.

(B) Enforcement of plan

Any directive issued and plan approved under subparagraph (A) shall be enforceable under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1818 ] to the same extent and in the same manner as an outstanding order which was issued under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and has become final.

(5) Plan taken into account in other proceedings

The appropriate Federal banking agency may

(A) consider a savings association’s progress in adhering to any plan required under paragraph (4) whenever such association or any affiliate of such association (including any company which controls such association) seeks the approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for any proposal which would have the effect of diverting earnings, diminishing capital, or otherwise impeding such association’s progress in meeting the minimum level of capital required by the appropriate Federal banking agency; and

(B) disapprove any proposal referred to in subparagraph (A) if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the proposal would adversely affect the ability of the association to comply with such plan.
