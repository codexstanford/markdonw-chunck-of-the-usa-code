##### (m) Secondary reserve offsets against premiums

(1) Offsets in calendar years beginning before 1993

Subject to the maximum amount limitation contained in paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, any insured savings association may offset such association’s pro rata share of the statutorily prescribed amount against any premium assessed against such association under subsection (b) of this section for any calendar year beginning before 1993.

(2) Annual maximum amount limitation

The amount of any offset allowed for any savings association under paragraph (1) for any calendar year beginning before 1993 shall not exceed an amount which is equal to 20 percent of such association’s pro rata share of the statutorily prescribed amount (as computed for such calendar year).

(3) Offsets in calendar years beginning after 1992

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a savings association may offset such association’s pro rata share of the statutorily prescribed amount against any premium assessed against such association under subsection (b) for any calendar year beginning after 1992.

(4) Transferability

No right, title, or interest of any insured depository institution in or with respect to its pro rata share of the secondary reserve shall be assignable or transferable whether by operation of law or otherwise, except to the extent that the Corporation may provide for transfer of such pro rata share in cases of merger or consolidation, transfer of bulk assets or assumption of liabilities, and similar transactions, as defined by the Corporation for purposes of this paragraph.

(5) Pro rata distribution on termination of insured status

If

(A) the status of any savings association as an insured depository institution is terminated pursuant to any provision of section 1818 of this title or the insurance of accounts of any such institution is otherwise terminated;

(B) a receiver or other legal custodian is appointed for the purpose of liquidation or winding up the affairs of any savings association; or

(C) the Corporation makes a determination that for the purposes of this subsection any savings association has otherwise gone into liquidation, the Corporation shall pay in cash to such institution its pro rata share of the secondary reserve, in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Corporation may prescribe, or, at the option of the Corporation, the Corporation may apply the whole or any part of the amount which would otherwise be paid in cash toward the payment of any indebtedness or obligation, whether matured or not, of such institution to the Corporation, existing or arising before such payment in cash. Such payment or such application need not be made to the extent that the provisions of the exception in paragraph (4) are applicable.

(6) “Statutorily prescribed amount” defined

For purposes of this subsection, the term “statutorily prescribed amount” means, with respect to any calendar year which ends after August 9, 1989

(A) $823,705,000, minus

(B) the sum of

(i) the aggregate amount of offsets made before August 9, 1989 , by all insured institutions under section 404(e)(2)  1 of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1727(e)(2) ] (as in effect before August 9, 1989 ); and

(ii) the aggregate amount of offsets made by all savings associations under this subsection before the beginning of such calendar year.

(7) Savings association’s pro rata amount

For purposes of this subsection, any savings association’s pro rata share of the statutorily prescribed amount is the percentage which is equal to such association’s share of the secondary reserve as determined under section 404(e)  1 of the National Housing Act on the day before the date on which the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ceased to recognize the secondary reserve (as such Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] was in effect on the day before such date).

(8) Year of enactment rule

With respect to the calendar year in which the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 is enacted, the Corporation shall make such adjustments as may be necessary

(A) in the computation of the statutorily prescribed amount which shall be applicable for the remainder of such calendar year after taking into account the aggregate amount of offsets by all insured institutions under section 404(e)(2)  1 of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1727(e)(2) ] (as in effect before August 9, 1989 ) after the beginning of such calendar year and before August 9, 1989 ; and

(B) in the computation of the maximum amount of any savings association’s offset for such calendar year under paragraph (1) after taking into account

(i) the amount of any offset by such savings association under section 404(e)(2)  1 of the National Housing Act (as in effect before August 9, 1989 ) after the beginning of such calendar year and before August 9, 1989 ; and

(ii) the change of such association’s premium year from the 1-year period applicable under section 404(b)  1 of the National Housing Act (as in effect before August 9, 1989 ) to a calendar year basis.
