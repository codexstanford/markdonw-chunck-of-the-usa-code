### CHAPTER 12— SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS
#### § 1467a. Regulation of holding companies
##### (p) Holding company activities constituting serious risk to subsidiary savings association

(1) Determination and imposition of restrictions

If the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency for the savings association determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of any activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a savings and loan holding company’s subsidiary savings association, the Board may impose such restrictions as the Board, in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the savings association determines to be necessary to address such risk. Such restrictions shall be issued in the form of a directive to the holding company and any of its subsidiaries, limiting

(A) the payment of dividends by the savings association;

(B) transactions between the savings association, the holding company, and the subsidiaries or affiliates of either; and

(C) any activities of the savings association that might create a serious risk that the liabilities of the holding company and its other affiliates may be imposed on the savings association. Such directive shall be effective as a cease and desist order that has become final.

(2) Review of directive

(A) Administrative review

After a directive referred to in paragraph (1) is issued, the savings and loan holding company, or any subsidiary of such holding company subject to the directive, may object and present in writing its reasons why the directive should be modified or rescinded. Unless within 10 days after receipt of such response the Board affirms, modifies, or rescinds the directive, such directive shall automatically lapse.

(B) Judicial review

If the Board affirms or modifies a directive pursuant to subparagraph (A), any affected party may immediately thereafter petition the United States district court for the district in which the savings and loan holding company has its main office or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to stay, modify, terminate or set aside the directive. Upon a showing of extraordinary cause, the savings and loan holding company, or any subsidiary of such holding company subject to a directive, may petition a United States district court for relief without first pursuing or exhausting the administrative remedies set forth in this paragraph.
