### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1818. Termination of status as insured depository institution
##### (c) Temporary cease-and-desist orders

(1) Whenever the appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the depository institution, or is likely to weaken the condition of the depository institution or otherwise prejudice the interests of its depositors prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring the depository institution or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (b)(6). Such order shall become effective upon service upon the depository institution or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the agency shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the depository institution or such party, until the effective date of such order.

(2) Within ten days after the depository institution concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the depository institution or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the depository institution is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.

If a notice of charges served under subsection (b)(1) specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that an insured depository institution’s books and records are so incomplete or inaccurate that the appropriate Federal banking agency is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of that depository institution or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that depository institution, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring

(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or

(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (b)(1).

(B) Effective period .

Any temporary order issued under subparagraph (A)

(i) shall become effective upon service; and

(ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of

(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (b)(1) in connection with the notice of charges; or

(II) the date the appropriate Federal banking agency determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured depository institution’s books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the depository institution.

(4) False advertising or misuse of names to indicate insured status.

(A) Temporary order.

(i) In general .

If a notice of charges served under subsection (b)(1) specifies on the basis of particular facts that any person engaged or is engaging in conduct described in section 1828(a)(4) of this title , the Corporation or other appropriate Federal banking agency may issue a temporary order requiring

(I) the immediate cessation of any activity or practice described, which gave rise to the notice of charges; and

(II) affirmative action to prevent any further, or to remedy any existing, violation.

(ii) Effect of order .

Any temporary order issued under this subparagraph shall take effect upon service.

(B) Effective period of temporary order .

A temporary order issued under subparagraph (A) shall remain effective and enforceable, pending the completion of an administrative proceeding pursuant to subsection (b)(1) in connection with the notice of charges

(i) until such time as the Corporation or other appropriate Federal banking agency dismisses the charges specified in such notice; or

(ii) if a cease-and-desist order is issued against such person, until the effective date of such order.

(C) Civil money penalties .

Any violation of section 1828(a)(4) of this title shall be subject to civil money penalties, as set forth in subsection (i), except that for any person other than an insured depository institution or an institution-affiliated party that is found to have violated this paragraph, the Corporation or other appropriate Federal banking agency shall not be required to demonstrate any loss to an insured depository institution.
