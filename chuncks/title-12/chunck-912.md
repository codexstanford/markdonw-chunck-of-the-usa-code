(ii) To develop domestic residential housing units, not to exceed the lesser of $30,000,000 or 30 percent of the savings association’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, if

(II) the appropriate Federal banking agency, by order, permits the savings association to avail itself of the higher limit provided by this clause;

(III) loans made under this clause to all borrowers do not, in aggregate, exceed 150 percent of the savings association’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus; and

(IV) such loans comply with all applicable loan-to-value requirements.

The appropriate Federal banking agency may impose more stringent restrictions on a savings association’s loans to one borrower if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that such restrictions are necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the savings association.
