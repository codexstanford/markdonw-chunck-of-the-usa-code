#### § 1715z–20. Insurance of home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners
##### (f) Counseling services and information for mortgagors

The Secretary shall provide or cause to be provided adequate counseling for the mortgagor, as described in subsection (d)(2)(B). Such counseling shall be provided by counselors that meet qualification standards and follow uniform counseling protocols. The qualification standards and counseling protocols shall be established by the Secretary within 12 months of July 30, 2008 . The protocols shall require a qualified counselor to discuss with each mortgagor information which shall include

(1) options other than a home equity conversion mortgage that are available to the homeowner, including other housing, social service, health, and financial options;

(2) other home equity conversion options that are or may become available to the homeowner, such as sale-leaseback financing, deferred payment loans, and property tax deferral;

(3) the financial implications of entering into a home equity conversion mortgage;

(4) a disclosure that a home equity conversion mortgage may have tax consequences, affect eligibility for assistance under Federal and State programs, and have an impact on the estate and heirs of the homeowner; and

(5) any other information that the Secretary may require. The Secretary shall consult with consumer groups, industry representatives, representatives of counseling organizations, and other interested parties to identify alternative approaches to providing consumer information required by this subsection that may be feasible and desirable for home equity conversion mortgages insured under this section and other types of reverse mortgages. The Secretary may, in lieu of providing the consumer education required by this subsection, adopt alternative approaches to consumer education that may be developed as a result of such consultations, but only if the alternative approaches provide all of the information specified in this subsection.
