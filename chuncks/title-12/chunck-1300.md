Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter except section 1715c of this title , and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX–B, other than the limitation in section 1709(g) of this title , the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX–B a mortgage executed in connection with the repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property located in an older, declining urban area in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section or subchapter under which insurance is sought could not be met, if the Secretary finds that (1) the area is reasonably viable, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing or group practice facilities for families of low and moderate income in such area, and (2) the property is an acceptable risk in view of such consideration. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.
