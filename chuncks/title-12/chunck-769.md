### CHAPTER 11— FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS
#### § 1430. Advances to members
##### (h) Special liquidity advances

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), the Federal Home Loan Banks may, upon the request of the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, make short-term liquidity advances to a savings association that

(A) is solvent but presents a supervisory concern because of such association’s poor financial condition; and

(B) has reasonable and demonstrable prospects of returning to a satisfactory financial condition.

(2) Interest on and security for special liquidity advances

Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be subject to all applicable collateral requirements, including the requirements of subsection (a), and shall be at an interest rate no less favorable than those made available for similar short-term liquidity advances to savings associations that do not present such supervisory concern.
