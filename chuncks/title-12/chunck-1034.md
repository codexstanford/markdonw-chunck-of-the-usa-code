#### § 1701q. Supportive housing for the elderly
##### (g) Provisions of services

(1) In general

In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall ensure that housing assisted under this section provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the category or categories of elderly persons (including frail elderly persons) occupying such housing. Such services may include (A) meal service adequate to meet nutritional need; (B) housekeeping aid; (C) personal assistance; (D) transportation services; (E) health-related services; (F) providing education and outreach regarding telemarketing fraud, in accordance with the standards issued under section 671(f) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 ( 42 U.S.C. 13631(f) ); and (G) such other services as the Secretary deems essential for maintaining independent living. The Secretary may permit the provision of services to elderly persons who are not residents if the participation of such persons will not adversely affect the cost-effectiveness or operation of the program or add significantly to the need for assistance under this Act.

(2) Local coordination of services

The Secretary shall ensure that owners have the managerial capacity to

(A) assess on an ongoing basis the service needs of residents;

(B) coordinate the provision of supportive services and tailor such services to the individual needs of residents; and

(C) seek on a continuous basis new sources of assistance to ensure the long-term provision of supportive services. Any cost associated with this subsection shall be an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2).

(3) Service coordinators

Any cost associated with employing or otherwise retaining a service coordinator in housing assisted under this section shall be considered an eligible cost under subsection (c)(2). If a project is receiving congregate housing services assistance under section 8011 of title 42 , the amount of costs provided under subsection (c)(2) for the project service coordinator may not exceed the additional amount necessary to cover the costs of providing for the coordination of services for residents of the project who are not eligible residents under such section 8011 of title 42 . To the extent that amounts are available pursuant to subsection (c)(2) for the costs of carrying out this paragraph within a project, an owner of housing assisted under this section shall provide a service coordinator for the housing to coordinate the provision of services under this subsection within the housing.
