### CHAPTER 31— NATIONAL CONSUMER COOPERATIVE BANK
#### § 3018. Loans
##### (d) Assignment of guaranteed loans; contestability of guarantee; criteria for purchase by Bank of guaranteed loan in lieu of requiring service by lender

Any loan guaranteed under subsection (c) shall be assignable to the extent provided in the contract of guarantee as may be determined by the Bank. The guarantee shall be uncontestable, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time he acquired the loan. The Bank in lieu of requiring such lender to service such guaranteed loan until final maturity or liquidation, may purchase the loan for the balance of the principal and accrued interest thereon without penalty, if it determines that (1) the liquidation of the loan would result in the insolvency of the borrower or deprive the borrower of assets essential to its continued operation, and (2) the loan will be repayable with revision of the loan rates, terms, or payment periods or other conditions not inconsistent with loans made by the Bank under subsection (a) of this section, which revisions the lender or other holder of such guaranteed loan is unwilling to make.
