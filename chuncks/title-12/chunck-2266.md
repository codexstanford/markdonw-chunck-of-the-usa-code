(1) No State nonmember insured bank shall establish and operate any new domestic branch unless it shall have the prior written consent of the Corporation, and no State nonmember insured bank shall move its main office or any such branch from one location to another without such consent. No foreign bank may move any insured branch from one location to another without such consent. The factors to be considered in granting or withholding the consent of the Corporation under this subsection shall be those enumerated in section 1816 of this title .

(2) No State nonmember insured bank shall establish or operate any foreign branch, except with the prior written consent of the Corporation and upon such conditions and pursuant to such regulations as the Corporation may prescribe from time to time.

(3) Exclusive authority for additional branches.

(A) In general .

Effective June 1, 1997 , a State nonmember bank may not acquire, establish, or operate a branch in any State other than the bank’s home State (as defined in section 1831u(f)(4)  1 of this title) or a State in which the bank already has a branch unless the acquisition, establishment, or operation of a branch in such State by a State nonmember bank is authorized under this subsection or section 1823(f), 1823(k), or 1831u of this title.

(B) Retention of branches .

In the case of a State nonmember bank which relocates the main office of such bank from 1 State to another State after May 31, 1997 , the bank may retain and operate branches within the State which was the bank’s home State (as defined in section 1831u(f)(4)  1 of this title) before the relocation of such office only to the extent the bank would be authorized, under this section or any other provision of law referred to in subparagraph (A), to acquire, establish, or commence to operate a branch in such State if

(i) the bank had no branches in such State; or

(ii) the branch resulted from

(I) an interstate merger transaction approved pursuant to section 1831u of this title ; or

(II) a transaction after May 31, 1997 , pursuant to which the bank received assistance from the Corporation under section 1823(c) of this title .

(4) State “opt-in” election to permit interstate branching through de novo branches.

(A) In general .

Subject to subparagraph (B), the Corporation may approve an application by an insured State nonmember bank to establish and operate a de novo branch in a State (other than the bank’s home State) in which the bank does not maintain a branch if

(i) the law of the State in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch, if the bank were a State bank chartered by such State; and

(ii) the conditions established in, or made applicable to this paragraph by, subparagraph (B) are met.

(B) Conditions on establishment and operation of interstate branch.

(i) Establishment .

An application by an insured State nonmember bank to establish and operate a de novo branch in a host State shall be subject to the same requirements and conditions to which an application for a merger transaction is subject under paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of section 1831u(b) of this title .

(ii) Operation .

Subsections (c) and (d)(2) of section 1831u of this title shall apply with respect to each branch of an insured State nonmember bank which is established and operated pursuant to an application approved under this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent such provisions of such section apply to a branch of a State bank which resulted from a merger transaction under such section 1831u of this title .

(C) “De novo branch” defined .

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “de novo branch” means a branch of a State bank which

(i) is originally established by the State bank as a branch; and

(ii) does not become a branch of such bank as a result of

(I) the acquisition by the bank of an insured depository institution or a branch of an insured depository institution; or

(II) the conversion, merger, or consolidation of any such institution or branch.

(D) “Home state” defined .

The term “home State” means the State by which a State bank is chartered.
