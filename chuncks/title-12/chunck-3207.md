### CHAPTER 28— EMERGENCY MORTGAGE RELIEF
#### § 2703. Manner of assistance and repayment
##### (e) Deferral of commencement of repayment; security for repayment

The Secretary may provide for the deferral of the commencement of the repayment of a loan or advance insured under section 2704 of this title or emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 2705 of this title until one year following the date of the last disbursement of the proceeds of the loan or advance or payments or for such longer period as the Secretary determines would further the purpose of this chapter. Any eligible homeowner who receives a grant or an advance of credit under this chapter may repay the loan in full, without penalty, by lump sum or by installment payments at any time before the loan becomes due and payable. The Secretary shall by regulation require such security for the repayment of insured loans or advances of credit or emergency mortgage relief payments as he deems appropriate and may require that such repayment be secured by a lien on the mortgaged property.
