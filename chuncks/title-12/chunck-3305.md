### CHAPTER 31— NATIONAL CONSUMER COOPERATIVE BANK
#### § 3018. Loans
##### (a) General requirements for loans and commitments for loans; limitations; allocation of assistance for low-income persons; criteria and factors for making loans, etc.; publication

The Bank may make loans and commitments for loans under this subsection to any organization determined by the Bank to be eligible under the provisions of section 3015 of this title , and may purchase or discount obligations of members of such organizations if the Bank, to the exclusion of all other persons, entities, agencies, or jurisdictions, also determines that the applicant has or will have a sound organizational and financial structure, income in excess of its operating costs and assets in excess of its obligations, and a reasonable expectation of a continuing demand for its production, goods, commodities, or services, or the use of its facilities, so that the loan will be fully repayable in accordance with its terms and conditions. Commencing on October 1, 1985 , the Bank shall not make any loan to a cooperative for the purpose of financing the construction, ownership, acquisition, or improvement of any structure used primarily for residential purposes if, after giving effect to such loan, the aggregate amount of all loans outstanding for such purpose would exceed 30 per centum of the gross assets of the Bank. The Board of Directors shall use its best efforts to insure that at the end of each fiscal year of the Bank at least 35 per centum of its outstanding loans are to

(1) cooperatives at least a majority of the members of which are low-income persons, and

(2) other cooperatives, if the proceeds of such loans are directly applied to finance a facility, activity, or service that the Board finds will be used predominantly by low-income persons. The Board shall adopt and publish in the Federal Register rules defining the term “low-income persons” for purposes of this subsection. The criteria to be applied and the factors to be considered by the Bank in making loans, loan commitments, purchases, discounts, and guarantees shall include an assessment of the impact of the loan on existing small businesses in the eligible organizations’ business territory. The criteria and factors shall be stated in rules of the Bank which shall be published and made available to applicants and, upon request, to any other person or organization.
