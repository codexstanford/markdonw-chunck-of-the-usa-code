#### § 1715z–1a. Assistance for troubled multifamily housing projects
##### (n) Allocation of assistance

(1) Set-aside

In providing, and contracting to provide, assistance for capital improvements under this section, in each fiscal year the Secretary shall set aside an amount, as determined by the Secretary, for projects that are eligible for incentives under section 224(b) of the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, as such section existed before November 28, 1990 . The Secretary may make such assistance available on a noncompetitive basis.

(2) General rules for allocation

Except as provided in paragraph (3), with respect to assistance under this section not set aside for projects under paragraph (1), the Secretary

(A) may award assistance on a noncompetitive basis; and

(B) shall award assistance to eligible projects on the basis of

(i) the extent to which the project is physically or financially troubled, as evidenced by the comprehensive needs assessment submitted in accordance with title IV of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992; and

(ii) the extent to which such assistance is necessary and reasonable to prevent the default of federally insured mortgages.

(3) Exceptions

The Secretary may make exceptions to selection criteria set forth in paragraph (2)(B) to permit the provision of assistance to eligible projects based upon

(A) the extent to which such assistance is necessary to prevent the imminent foreclosure or default of a project whose owner has not submitted a comprehensive needs assessment pursuant to title IV of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992;

(B) the extent to which the project presents an imminent threat to the life, health, and safety of project residents; or

(C) such other criteria as the Secretary may specify by regulation or by notice printed in the Federal Register.

(4) Considerations

In providing assistance under this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration

(A) the extent to which there is evidence that there will be significant opportunities for residents (including a resident council or resident management corporation, as appropriate) to be involved in the management of the project (except that this paragraph shall have no application to projects that are owned as cooperatives); and

(B) the extent to which there is evidence that the project owner has provided competent management and complied with all regulatory and administrative requirements.
