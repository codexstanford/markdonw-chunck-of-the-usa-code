### CHAPTER 14— FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS
#### § 1787. Payment of insurance
##### (f) Valuation of claims in default

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law or the law of any State, this subsection shall govern the rights of the creditors (other than insured accountholders) of such credit union.

(2) Maximum liability

The maximum liability of the Board, acting as liquidating agent or in any other capacity, to any person having a claim against the liquidating agent or the insured credit union for which such liquidating agent is appointed shall equal the amount such claimant would have received if the Board had liquidated the assets and liabilities of such credit union without exercising the Board’s authority under subsection (n) of this section.

(3) Additional payments authorized

(A) In general

The Board may, in its discretion and in the interests of minimizing its losses, use its own resources to make additional payments or credit additional amounts to or with respect to or for the account of any claimant or category of claimants. The Board shall not be obligated, as a result of having made any such payment or credited any such amount to or with respect to or for the account of any claimant or category of claimants, to make payments to any other claimant or category of claimants.

(B) Manner of payment

The Board may make the payments or credit the amounts specified in subparagraph (A) directly to the claimants or may make such payments or credit such amounts to an open insured credit union to induce the open insured credit union to accept liability for such claims.
