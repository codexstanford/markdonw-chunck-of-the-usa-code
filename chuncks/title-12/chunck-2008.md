### CHAPTER 14— FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS
#### § 1787. Payment of insurance
##### (a) Liquidation by Board; bond; appointment of agent; fees to be fixed by Board

(1)

(A) Upon its finding that a Federal credit union insured under this subchapter is bankrupt or insolvent, the Board shall close such credit union for liquidation and appoint itself liquidating agent therefor.

(B) Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Board closes a credit union for liquidation pursuant to paragraph (1), or accepts appointment as liquidating agent pursuant to subsection (b), such insured credit union may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the principal office of such insured credit union is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Board to show cause why it should not be prohibited from continuing such liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, no court may take any action for or toward the removal of any liquidating agent or, except at the instance of the Board, restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of a liquidating agent.

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board as liquidating agent of a closed Federal credit union insured under this subchapter shall not be required to furnish bond and shall have the right to appoint an agent or agents to assist it in its duties as such liquidating agent. All fees, compensation, and expenses of liquidation and administration thereof shall be fixed by the Board and may be paid by them out of funds coming into its possession as such liquidating agent.

(3) Liquidation to facilitate prompt corrective action .

The Board may close any credit union for liquidation, and appoint itself or another (including, in the case of a State-chartered insured credit union, the State official having jurisdiction over the credit union) as liquidating agent of that credit union, if

(A) the Board determines that

(i) the credit union is significantly undercapitalized, as defined in section 1790d of this title , and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, as defined in section 1790d of this title ; or

(ii) the credit union is critically undercapitalized, as defined in section 1790d of this title ; and

(B) in the case of a State-chartered insured credit union, the Board has complied with section 1790d( l ) of this title.
