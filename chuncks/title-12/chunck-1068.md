##### (c) Definitions

As used in this section, the term

(1) “qualified tenant” means any individual or family having an income which would qualify such individual or family for assistance under section 1437f of title 42 , except that such term shall also include any individual or family who was receiving assistance under this section on the day preceding December 21, 1979 , so long as such individual or family continues to meet the conditions for such assistance which were in effect on such day; and

(2) “income” means income from all sources of each member of the household, as determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary. In determining amounts to be excluded from income, the Secretary may, in the Secretary’s discretion, take into account the number of minor children in the household and such other factors as the Secretary may determine are appropriate. The terms “qualified tenant” and “tenant” include a member of a cooperative who satisfies the foregoing requirements and who, upon resale of his membership to the cooperative, will not be reimbursed for any equity increment accumulated through payments under this section. With respect to members of a cooperative, the terms “rental” and “rental charges” mean the charges under the occupancy agreements between such members and the cooperative.
