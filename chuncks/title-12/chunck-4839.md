(1) Time for filing notice of appeal

The notice of appeal of any order, whether interlocutory or final, entered in any case brought by the Corporation against a director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, accountant, or appraiser of the covered financial company, or any other person employed by or providing services to a covered financial company, shall be filed not later than 30 days after the date of entry of the order. The hearing of the appeal shall be held not later than 120 days after the date of the notice of appeal. The appeal shall be decided not later than 180 days after the date of the notice of appeal.

(2) Scheduling

The court shall expedite the consideration of any case brought by the Corporation against a director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, accountant, or appraiser of a covered financial company or any other person employed by or providing services to a covered financial company. As far as practicable, the court shall give such case priority on its docket.

(3) Judicial discretion

The court may modify the schedule and limitations stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a particular case, based on a specific finding that the ends of justice that would be served by making such a modification would outweigh the best interest of the public in having the case resolved expeditiously.
