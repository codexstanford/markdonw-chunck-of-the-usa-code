##### (a) Review of regulations; regulatory uniformity

During the 2-year period beginning on September 23, 1994 , each Federal banking agency shall, consistent with the principles of safety and soundness, statutory law and policy, and the public interest

(1) conduct a review of the regulations and written policies of that agency to

(B) remove inconsistencies and outmoded and duplicative requirements; and

(C) with respect to regulations prescribed pursuant to section 1828( o ) of this title, consider the impact that such standards have on the availability of credit for small business, residential, and agricultural purposes, and on low- and moderate-income communities;

(2) review the extent to which existing regulations require insured depository institutions and insured credit unions to produce unnecessary internal written policies and eliminate such requirements, where appropriate;

(3) work jointly with the other Federal banking agencies to make uniform all regulations and guidelines implementing common statutory or supervisory policies; and

(4) submit a joint report to the Congress at the end of such 2-year period detailing the progress of the agencies in carrying out this subsection.
