The Board may prohibit or limit, by regulation or order, any golden parachute payment or indemnification payment.

(2) Factors to be taken into account

The Board shall prescribe, by regulation, the factors to be considered by the Board in taking any action pursuant to paragraph (1) which may include such factors as the following:

(A) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the institution-affiliated party has committed any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the credit union that has had a material affect on the financial condition of the credit union.

(B) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the institution-affiliated party is substantially responsible for the insolvency of the credit union, the appointment of a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union, or the credit union’s troubled condition (as defined in regulations prescribed by the Board pursuant to paragraph (4)(A)(ii)(III)).

(C) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the institution-affiliated party has materially violated any applicable Federal or State banking law or regulation that has had a material effect on the financial condition of the credit union.

(i) section 215, 656, 657, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1014, 1032, or 1344 of title 18; or

(ii) section 1341 or 1343 of such title affecting a financial institution.

(E) Whether the institution-affiliated party was in a position of managerial or fiduciary responsibility.

(F) The length of time the party was affiliated with the credit union and the degree to which

(i) the payment reasonably reflects compensation earned over the period of employment; and

(ii) the compensation involved represents a reasonable payment for services rendered.

(3) Certain payments prohibited

No credit union may prepay the salary or any liability or legal expense of any institution-affiliated party if such payment is made

(A) in contemplation of the insolvency of such credit union or after the commission of an act of insolvency; and

(V) the credit union is subject to a proceeding initiated by the Board to terminate or suspend deposit insurance for such credit union.

(B) Certain payments in contemplation of an event

Any payment which would be a golden parachute payment but for the fact that such payment was made before the date referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be treated as a golden parachute payment if the payment was made in contemplation of the occurrence of an event described in any subclause of such subparagraph.

Subject to paragraph (6), the term “indemnification payment” means any payment (or any agreement to make any payment) by any credit union for the benefit of any person who is or was an institution-affiliated party, to pay or reimburse such person for any liability or legal expense with regard to any administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Board which results in a final order under which such person

(II) the liquidation, after such date, of the amount of such payment.

(6) Certain commercial insurance coverage not treated as covered benefit payment

No provision of this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting any credit union from purchasing any commercial insurance policy or fidelity bond, except that, subject to any requirement described in paragraph (5)(A)(iii), such insurance policy or bond shall not cover any legal or liability expense of the credit union which is described in paragraph (5)(A).
