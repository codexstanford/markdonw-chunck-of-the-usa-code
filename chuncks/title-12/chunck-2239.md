##### (f) Assisted emergency interstate acquisitions
######## (E) Certain State Interstate Banking Laws Inapplicable .

Any holding company which acquires control of any insured bank or holding company under paragraph (2) or (3) or subparagraph (D) of this paragraph shall not, by reason of such acquisition, be required under the law of any State to divest any other insured bank or be prevented from acquiring any other bank or holding company.

(5) In determining whether to arrange a sale of assets and assumption of liabilities or an acquisition or a merger under the authority of paragraph (2) or (3), the Corporation may solicit such offers or proposals as are practicable from any prospective purchasers or merger partners it determines, in its sole discretion, are both qualified and capable of acquiring the assets and liabilities of the bank in default or the bank in danger of default.

(6)

(A) If, after receiving offers, the offer presenting the lowest expense to the Corporation, that is in a form and with conditions acceptable to the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the “lowest acceptable offer”), is from an offeror that is not an existing in-State bank of the same type as the bank that is in default or is in danger of default (or, where the bank is an insured bank other than a mutual savings bank, the lowest acceptable offer is not from an in-State holding company), the Corporation shall permit the offeror which made the initial lowest acceptable offer and each offeror who made an offer the estimated cost of which to the Corporation was within 15 per centum or $15,000,000, whichever is less, of the initial lowest acceptable offer to submit a new offer.

(B) In considering authorizations under this subsection, the Corporation shall give consideration to the need to minimize the cost of financial assistance and to the maintenance of specialized depository institutions. The Corporation shall authorize transactions under this subsection considering the following priorities:

(i) First, between depository institutions of the same type within the same State.

(ii) Second, between depository institutions of the same type

(I) in different States which by statute specifically authorize such acquisitions; or

(II) in the absence of such statutes, in different States which are contiguous.

(iii) Third, between depository institutions of the same type in different States other than the States described in clause (ii).

(iv) Fourth, between depository institutions of different types in the same State.

(v) Fifth, between depository institutions of different types

(I) in different States which by statute specifically authorize such acquisitions; or

(II) in the absence of such statutes, in different States which are contiguous.

(vi) Sixth, between depository institutions of different types in different States other than the States described in clause (v).
