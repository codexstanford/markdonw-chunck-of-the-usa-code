In carrying out this section, the Secretary may dispose of a multifamily housing project owned by the Secretary on a negotiated, competitive bid, or other basis, on such terms as the Secretary deems appropriate considering the low-income character of the project and consistent with the goals in subsection (a), only to a purchaser determined by the Secretary to be capable of

(A) satisfying the conditions of the disposition plan developed under paragraph (2) for the project;

(B) implementing a sound financial and physical management program that is designed to enable the project to meet anticipated operating and repair expenses to ensure that the project will remain in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and in compliance with any standards under applicable State or local laws, rules, ordinances, or regulations relating to the physical condition of the housing and any such standards established by the Secretary;

(C) responding to the needs of the tenants and working cooperatively with tenant organizations;

(D) providing adequate organizational, staff, and financial resources to the project; and

(E) meeting such other requirements as the Secretary may determine.

(2) Disposition plan

(A) In general

Prior to the sale of a multifamily housing project that is owned by the Secretary, the Secretary shall develop an initial disposition plan for the project that specifies the minimum terms and conditions of the Secretary for disposition of the project, the initial sales price that is acceptable to the Secretary, and the assistance that the Secretary plans to make available to a prospective purchaser in accordance with this section.

(B) Market-wide plans

In developing the initial disposition plan under this subsection for a multifamily housing project located in a market area in which at least 1 other multifamily housing project owned by the Secretary is located, the Secretary may coordinate the disposition of all such multifamily housing projects located within the same market area to the extent and in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out the goals under subsection (a).

(C) Sales price

The initial sales price shall be reasonably related to the intended use of the project after sale, any rehabilitation requirements for the project, the rents for units in the project that can be supported by the market, the amount of rental assistance available for the project under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ], the occupancy profile of the project (including family size and income levels for tenant families), and any other factors that the Secretary considers appropriate.

(D) Community and tenant input

In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall develop procedures

(i) to obtain appropriate and timely input into disposition plans from officials of the unit of general local government affected, the community in which the project is situated, and the tenants of the project; and

(ii) to facilitate, where feasible and appropriate, the sale of multifamily housing projects to existing tenant organizations with demonstrated capacity, to public or nonprofit entities that represent or are affiliated with existing tenant organizations, or to other public or nonprofit entities.

(E) Technical assistance

To carry out the procedures developed under subparagraph (D), the Secretary may provide technical assistance, directly or indirectly, and may use amounts available for technical assistance under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, subtitle C of the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [ 12 U.S.C. 4141 et seq.], subtitle B of title IV of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [ 42 U.S.C. 12871 et seq.], or this section, for the provision of technical assistance under this paragraph.

(B) dispose of a multifamily housing project through a foreclosure sale only to a purchaser that the Secretary determines is capable of implementing a sound financial and physical management program that is designed to enable the project to meet anticipated operating and repair expenses to ensure that the project will remain in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and in compliance with any standards under applicable State or local laws, rules, ordinances, or regulations relating to the physical condition of the housing and any such standards established by the Secretary.
