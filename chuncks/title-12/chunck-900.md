### CHAPTER 12— SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS
#### § 1464. Federal savings associations
##### (i) Conversions

(1) In general

Any savings association which is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan bank may convert into a Federal savings association (and in so doing may change directly from the mutual form to the stock form, or from the stock form to the mutual form). Such conversion shall be subject to such regulations as the Comptroller shall prescribe. Thereafter such Federal savings association shall be entitled to all the benefits of this section and shall be subject to examination and regulation to the same extent as other associations incorporated pursuant to this chapter.

(2) Authority of Comptroller

(A) No savings association may convert from the mutual to the stock form, or from the stock form to the mutual form, except in accordance with the regulations of the Comptroller.

(B) Any aggrieved person may obtain review of a final action of the Comptroller which approves or disapproves a plan of conversion pursuant to this subsection only by complying with the provisions of section 1467a(j) of this title within the time limit and in the manner therein prescribed, which provisions shall apply in all respects as if such final action were an order the review of which is therein provided for, except that such time limit shall commence upon publication of notice of such final action in the Federal Register or upon the giving of such general notice of such final action as is required by or approved under regulations of the Comptroller, whichever is later.

(C) Any Federal savings association may change its designation from a Federal savings association to a Federal savings bank, or the reverse.

(3) Conversion to State association

(A) Any Federal savings association may convert itself into a savings association or savings bank organized pursuant to the laws of the State in which the principal office of such Federal savings association is located if

(i) the State permits the conversion of any savings association or savings bank of such State into a Federal savings association;

(ii) such conversion of a Federal savings association into such a State savings association is determined

(I) upon the vote in favor of such conversion cast in person or by proxy at a special meeting of members or stockholders called to consider such action, specified by the law of the State in which the home office of the Federal savings association is located, as required by such law for a State-chartered institution to convert itself into a Federal savings association, but in no event upon a vote of less than 51 percent of all the votes cast at such meeting, and

(II) upon compliance with other requirements reciprocally equivalent to the requirements of such State law for the conversion of a State-chartered institution into a Federal savings association;

(iii) notice of the meeting to vote on conversion shall be given as herein provided and no other notice thereof shall be necessary; the notice shall expressly state that such meeting is called to vote thereon, as well as the time and place thereof; and such notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date of the meeting, to the Comptroller and to each member or stockholder of record of the Federal savings association at the member’s or stockholder’s last address as shown on the books of the Federal savings association;

(iv) when a mutual savings association is dissolved after conversion, the members or shareholders of the savings association will share on a mutual basis in the assets of the association in exact proportion to their relative share or account credits;

(v) when a stock savings association is dissolved after conversion, the stockholders will share on an equitable basis in the assets of the association; and

(vi) such conversion shall be effective upon the date that all the provisions of this chapter shall have been fully complied with and upon the issuance of a new charter by the State wherein the savings association is located.

(B)

(i) The act of conversion constitutes consent by the institution to be bound by all the requirements that the Comptroller may impose under this chapter.

(ii) The savings association shall upon conversion and thereafter be authorized to issue securities in any form currently approved at the time of issue by the Comptroller for issuance by similar savings associations in such State.

(iii) If the insurance of accounts is terminated in connection with such conversion, the notice and other action shall be taken as provided by law and regulations for the termination of insurance of accounts.

(4) Savings bank activities

(A) To the extent authorized by the Comptroller, but subject to section 18(m)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1828(m)(3) ]

(i) any Federal savings bank chartered as such prior to October 15, 1982 , may continue to make any investment or engage in any activity not otherwise authorized under this section, to the degree it was permitted to do so as a Federal savings bank prior to October 15, 1982 ; and

(ii) any Federal savings bank in existence on August 9, 1989 , and formerly organized as a mutual savings bank under State law may continue to make any investment or engage in any activity not otherwise authorized under this section, to the degree it was authorized to do so as a mutual savings bank under State law.

(B) The authority conferred by this paragraph may be utilized by any Federal savings association that acquires, by merger or consolidation, a Federal savings bank enjoying grandfather rights hereunder.

(5) Conversion to national or State bank

(A) In general

Any Federal savings association chartered and in operation before November 12, 1999 , with branches in operation before November 12, 1999 , in 1 or more States, may convert, at its option, with the approval of the Comptroller for each national bank, and with the approval of the appropriate State bank supervisor and the appropriate Federal banking agency for each State bank, into 1 or more national or State banks, each of which may encompass 1 or more of the branches of the Federal savings association in operation before November 12, 1999 , in 1 or more States subject to subparagraph (B).

(B) Conditions of conversion

The authority in subparagraph (A) shall apply only if each resulting national or State bank

(i) will meet all financial, management, and capital requirements applicable to the resulting national or State bank; and

(ii) if more than 1 national or State bank results from a conversion under this subparagraph, has received approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 5(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1815(a) ].

(C) No merger application under FDIA required

No application under section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1828(c) ] shall be required for a conversion under this paragraph.

(D) Definitions

For purposes of this paragraph, the terms “State bank” and “State bank supervisor” have the same meanings as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1813 ].

(6) Limitation on certain conversions by Federal savings associations

A Federal savings association may not convert to a State bank or State savings association during any period in which the Federal savings association is subject to a cease and desist order (or other formal enforcement order) issued by, or a memorandum of understanding entered into with, the Office of Thrift Supervision or the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to a significant supervisory matter.
