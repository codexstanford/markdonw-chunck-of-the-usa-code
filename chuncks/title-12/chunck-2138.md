##### (b) Assessments

(1) Risk-based assessment system

(A) Risk-based assessment system required

The Board of Directors shall, by regulation, establish a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions.

(B) Private reinsurance authorized

In carrying out this paragraph, the Corporation may

(i) obtain private reinsurance covering not more than 10 percent of any loss the Corporation incurs with respect to an insured depository institution; and

(ii) base that institution’s assessment (in whole or in part) on the cost of the reinsurance.

(C) “Risk-based assessment system” defined

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “risk-based assessment system” means a system for calculating a depository institution’s assessment based on

(i) the probability that the Deposit Insurance Fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution, taking into consideration the risks attributable to

(I) different categories and concentrations of assets;

(II) different categories and concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured, contingent and noncontingent; and

(III) any other factors the Corporation determines are relevant to assessing such probability;

(ii) the likely amount of any such loss; and

(iii) the revenue needs of the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(D) Separate assessment systems

The Board of Directors may establish separate risk-based assessment systems for large and small members of the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(E) Information concerning risk of loss and economic conditions

(i) Sources of information

For purposes of determining risk of losses at insured depository institutions and economic conditions generally affecting depository institutions, the Corporation shall collect information, as appropriate, from all sources the Board of Directors considers appropriate, including reports of condition, inspection reports, and other information from all Federal banking agencies, any information available from State bank supervisors, State insurance and securities regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (including information described in section 1831 l of this title), the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, any Federal reserve bank or Federal home loan bank, and other regulators of financial institutions, and any information available from private economic, credit, or business analysts.

(ii) Consultation with Federal banking agencies

(I) In general

Except as provided in subclause (II), in assessing the risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund with respect to any insured depository institution, the Corporation shall consult with the appropriate Federal banking agency of such institution.

(II) Treatment on aggregate basis

In the case of insured depository institutions that are well capitalized (as defined in section 1831 o of this title) and, in the most recent examination, were found to be well managed, the consultation under subclause (I) concerning the assessment of the risk of loss posed by such institutions may be made on an aggregate basis.

(iii) Rule of construction

No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as providing any new authority for the Corporation to require submission of information by insured depository institutions to the Corporation, except as provided in subsection (a)(2)(B).

(F) Modifications to the risk-based assessment system allowed only after notice and comment

In revising or modifying the risk-based assessment system at any time after February 8, 2006 , the Board of Directors may implement such revisions or modification in final form only after notice and opportunity for comment.

(2) Setting assessments

(A) In general

The Board of Directors shall set assessments for insured depository institutions in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine to be necessary or appropriate, subject to subparagraph (D). 1

(B) Factors to be considered

In setting assessments under subparagraph (A), the Board of Directors shall consider the following factors:

(i) The estimated operating expenses of the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(ii) The estimated case resolution expenses and income of the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(iii) The projected effects of the payment of assessments on the capital and earnings of insured depository institutions.

(iv) The risk factors and other factors taken into account pursuant to paragraph (1) under the risk-based assessment system, including the requirement under such paragraph to maintain a risk-based system.

(v) Any other factors the Board of Directors may determine to be appropriate.

(D) 2 Notice of assessments

The Corporation shall notify each insured depository institution of that institution’s assessment.

(E) Bank Enterprise Act requirement

The Corporation shall design the risk-based assessment system so that, insofar as the system bases assessments, directly or indirectly, on deposits, the portion of the deposits of any insured depository institution which are attributable to lifeline accounts established in accordance with the Bank Enterprise Act of 1991 shall be subject to assessment at a rate determined in accordance with such Act.

(3) Designated reserve ratio

(A) Establishment

(i) In general

Before the beginning of each calendar year, the Board of Directors shall designate the reserve ratio applicable with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund and publish the reserve ratio so designated.

(ii) Rulemaking requirement

Any change to the designated reserve ratio shall be made by the Board of Directors by regulation after notice and opportunity for comment.

(B) Minimum reserve ratio

The reserve ratio designated by the Board of Directors for any year may not be less than 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits, or the comparable percentage of the assessment base set forth in paragraph (2)(C). 2

(C) Factors

In designating a reserve ratio for any year, the Board of Directors shall

(i) take into account the risk of losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund in such year and future years, including historic experience and potential and estimated losses from insured depository institutions;

(ii) take into account economic conditions generally affecting insured depository institutions so as to allow the designated reserve ratio to increase during more favorable economic conditions and to decrease during less favorable economic conditions, notwithstanding the increased risks of loss that may exist during such less favorable conditions, as determined to be appropriate by the Board of Directors;

(iii) seek to prevent sharp swings in the assessment rates for insured depository institutions; and

(iv) take into account such other factors as the Board of Directors may determine to be appropriate, consistent with the requirements of this subparagraph.

(D) Publication of proposed change in ratio

In soliciting comment on any proposed change in the designated reserve ratio in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Board of Directors shall include in the published proposal a thorough analysis of the data and projections on which the proposal is based.

(i) In general

Whenever

(I) the Corporation projects that the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund will, within 6 months of such determination, fall below the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) for the designated reserve ratio; or

(II) the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund actually falls below the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) for the designated reserve ratio without any determination under subclause (I) having been made,  the Corporation shall establish and implement a Deposit Insurance Fund restoration plan within 90 days that meets the requirements of clause (ii) and such other conditions as the Corporation determines to be appropriate.

(ii) Requirements of restoration plan

A Deposit Insurance Fund restoration plan meets the requirements of this clause if the plan provides that the reserve ratio of the Fund will meet or exceed the minimum amount specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) for the designated reserve ratio before the end of the 8-year period beginning upon the implementation of the plan (or such longer period as the Corporation may determine to be necessary due to extraordinary circumstances).

(II) the amount equal to 3 basis points of the institution’s assessment base.

(v) Transparency

Not more than 30 days after the Corporation establishes and implements a restoration plan under clause (i), the Corporation shall publish in the Federal Register a detailed analysis of the factors considered and the basis for the actions taken with regard to the plan.

(A) the end of the 3-year period beginning on the due date of the assessment; or

(B) in the case of a dispute between the insured depository institution and the Corporation with respect to such assessment, the date of a final determination of any such dispute.
