#### § 1701y. National Homeownership Foundation
##### (f) Annual report to the President and the Congress; contents

(1) Not later than one hundred and twenty days after the close of each fiscal year, the Foundation shall prepare and submit to the President and to the Congress a full report of its activities during such year. Such report shall include an account of the Foundation’s experiences with the efforts of private and public organizations to expand homeownership and housing opportunities for lower income families, together with such recommendations as it deems appropriate.

(2) Whenever in its judgement the general unavailability of mortgage funds is sufficiently serious to deter the Foundation from carrying out its objective of expanding homeownership and housing opportunities for lower income families, the Foundation shall, in its annual report or in a separate report to the President and the Congress, state its findings and make such recommendations for alternate means of financing housing for such families as it deems appropriate.
