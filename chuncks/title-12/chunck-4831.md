Unsecured claims against a covered financial company, or the Corporation as receiver for such covered financial company under this section, that are proven to the satisfaction of the receiver shall have priority in the following order:

(A) Administrative expenses of the receiver.

(B) Any amounts owed to the United States, unless the United States agrees or consents otherwise.

(C) Wages, salaries, or commissions, including vacation, severance, and sick leave pay earned by an individual (other than an individual described in subparagraph (G)), but only to the extent of $11,725 for each individual (as indexed for inflation, by regulation of the Corporation) earned not later than 180 days before the date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver.

(D) Contributions owed to employee benefit plans arising from services rendered not later than 180 days before the date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver, to the extent of the number of employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by $11,725 (as indexed for inflation, by regulation of the Corporation), less the aggregate amount paid to such employees under subparagraph (C), plus the aggregate amount paid by the receivership on behalf of such employees to any other employee benefit plan.

(E) Any other general or senior liability of the covered financial company (which is not a liability described under subparagraph (F), (G), or (H)).

(F) Any obligation subordinated to general creditors (which is not an obligation described under subparagraph (G) or (H)).

(G) Any wages, salaries, or commissions, including vacation, severance, and sick leave pay earned, owed to senior executives and directors of the covered financial company.

(H) Any obligation to shareholders, members, general partners, limited partners, or other persons, with interests in the equity of the covered financial company arising as a result of their status as shareholders, members, general partners, limited partners, or other persons with interests in the equity of the covered financial company.

(2) Post-receivership financing priority

In the event that the Corporation, as receiver for a covered financial company, is unable to obtain unsecured credit for the covered financial company from commercial sources, the Corporation as receiver may obtain credit or incur debt on the part of the covered financial company, which shall have priority over any or all administrative expenses of the receiver under paragraph (1)(A).

(3) Claims of the United States

Unsecured claims of the United States shall, at a minimum, have a higher priority than liabilities of the covered financial company that count as regulatory capital.

(4) Creditors similarly situated

All claimants of a covered financial company that are similarly situated under paragraph (1) shall be treated in a similar manner, except that the Corporation may take any action (including making payments, subject to subsection ( o )(1)(D)(i)) that does not comply with this subsection, if

(A) the Corporation determines that such action is necessary

(i) to maximize the value of the assets of the covered financial company;

(ii) to initiate and continue operations essential to implementation of the receivership or any bridge financial company;

(iii) to maximize the present value return from the sale or other disposition of the assets of the covered financial company; or

(iv) to minimize the amount of any loss realized upon the sale or other disposition of the assets of the covered financial company; and

(B) all claimants that are similarly situated under paragraph (1) receive not less than the amount provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (d).

(5) Secured claims unaffected

This section shall not affect secured claims or security entitlements in respect of assets or property held by the covered financial company, except to the extent that the security is insufficient to satisfy the claim, and then only with regard to the difference between the claim and the amount realized from the security.

(6) Priority of expenses and unsecured claims in the orderly liquidation of SIPC member

Where the Corporation is appointed as receiver for a covered broker or dealer, unsecured claims against such covered broker or dealer, or the Corporation as receiver for such covered broker or dealer under this section, that are proven to the satisfaction of the receiver under section 5385(e) of this title , shall have the priority prescribed in paragraph (1), except that

(C) SIPC shall be entitled to recover any amounts paid out of the SIPC Fund to meet its obligations under section 5385 of this title and under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 ( 15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.), which claim shall be subordinate to the claims payable under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1), but senior to all other claims; and

(D) the Corporation may, after paying any proven claims to customers under section 5385 of this title and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 ( 15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.), and as provided above, pay dividends on other proven claims, in its discretion, and to the extent that funds are available, in accordance with the priorities set forth in paragraph (1).
