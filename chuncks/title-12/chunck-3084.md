### CHAPTER 23— FARM CREDIT SYSTEM
#### § 2279bb–1. Risk-based capital levels
##### (b) Considerations

(1) Establishment of test

In establishing the risk-based capital test under subsection (a)

(A) the Director shall take into account appropriate distinctions based on various types of agricultural mortgage products, varying terms of Treasury obligations, and any other factors the Director considers appropriate;

(B) the Director shall conform loan data used in determining credit risk to the minimum geographic and commodity diversification standards applicable to pools of qualified loans eligible for guarantee;

(C) the Director may take into account retained subordinated participating interests under section 2279aa–6(b)(2) of this title (as in effect before February 10, 1996 );

(D) the Director may take into account other methods or tests to determine credit risk developed by the Corporation before December 13, 1991 ; and

(E) the Director shall consider any other information submitted by the Corporation in writing during the 180-day period beginning on December 13, 1991 .

(2) Revising test

Upon the expiration of the 8-year period beginning on December 13, 1991 , the Director shall examine the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) and may revise the test. In making examinations and revisions under this paragraph, the Director shall take into account that, before December 13, 1991 , the Corporation has not issued guarantees for pools of qualified loans. To the extent that the revision of the risk-based capital test causes a change in the classification of the Corporation within the enforcement levels established under section 2279bb–4 of this title , the Director shall waive the applicability of any additional enforcement actions available because of such change for a reasonable period of time, to permit the Corporation to increase the amount of regulatory capital of the Corporation accordingly.
