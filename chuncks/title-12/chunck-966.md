##### (b) Requirement

(1) In general

(A) Activities other than financial activities

If a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company conducts activities other than financial activities, the Board may require such company to establish and conduct all or a portion of such financial activities in or through an intermediate holding company, which shall be a savings and loan holding company, established pursuant to regulations of the Board, not later than 90 days (or such longer period as the Board may deem appropriate) after the transfer date. 1

(B) Other activities

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board shall require a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company to establish an intermediate holding company if the Board makes a determination that the establishment of such intermediate holding company is necessary

(i) to appropriately supervise activities that are determined to be financial activities; or

(ii) to ensure that supervision by the Board does not extend to the activities of such company that are not financial activities.

(2) Internal financial activities

(A) Treatment of internal financial activities

For purposes of this subsection, the internal financial activities of a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company shall not be required to be placed in an intermediate holding company.

(B) Grandfathered activities

A grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company may continue to engage in an internal financial activity, subject to review by the Board to determine whether engaging in such activity presents undue risk to the grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company or to the financial stability of the United States, if

(i) the grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company engaged in the activity during the year before July 21, 2010 ; and

(ii) at least ⅔ of the assets or ⅔ of the revenues generated from the activity are from or attributable to the grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company.

(3) Source of strength

A grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company that directly or indirectly controls an intermediate holding company established under this section shall serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding company.

(4) Parent company reports

The Board, may from time to time, examine and require reports under oath from a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company that controls an intermediate holding company, and from the appropriate officers or directors of such company, solely for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section, including assessing the ability of the company to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding company as required under paragraph (3) and enforcing compliance with such requirement.

(5) Limited parent company enforcement

(A) In general

In addition to any other authority of the Board, the Board may enforce compliance with the provisions of this subsection that are applicable to any company described in paragraph (1)(A) that controls an intermediate holding company under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1818 ], and a company described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be subject to such section (solely for purposes of this subparagraph) in the same manner and to the same extent as if the company described in paragraph (1)(A) were a savings and loan holding company.

(B) Application of other Act

Any violation of this subsection by a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company that controls an intermediate holding company may also be treated as a violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.] for purposes of subparagraph (A).

(C) No effect on other authority

No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as limiting any authority of the Board or any other Federal agency under any other provision of law.
