### CHAPTER 47— COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BANKING
#### § 4701. Findings and purposes
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) many of the Nation’s urban, rural, and Native American communities face critical social and economic problems arising in part from the lack of economic growth, people living in poverty, and the lack of employment and other opportunities;

(2) the restoration and maintenance of the economies of these communities will require coordinated development strategies, intensive supportive services, and increased access to equity investments and loans for development activities, including investment in businesses, housing, commercial real estate, human development, and other activities that promote the long-term economic and social viability of the community; and

(3) community development financial institutions have proven their ability to identify and respond to community needs for equity investments, loans, and development services.
