### CHAPTER 12— SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS
#### § 1467a. Regulation of holding companies
##### (m) Qualified thrift lender test

(1) In general

Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (7), any savings association is a qualified thrift lender if

(A) the savings association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association, as such term is defined in section 7701(a)(19) of title 26 ; or

(B)

(i) the savings association’s qualified thrift investments equal or exceed 65 percent of the savings association’s portfolio assets; and

(ii) the savings association’s qualified thrift investments continue to equal or exceed 65 percent of the savings association’s portfolio assets on a monthly average basis in 9 out of every 12 months.

(2) Exceptions granted by appropriate Federal banking agency

Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the appropriate Federal banking agency may grant such temporary and limited exceptions from the minimum actual thrift investment percentage requirement contained in such paragraph as the appropriate Federal banking agency deems necessary if

(A) the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that extraordinary circumstances exist, such as when the effects of high interest rates reduce mortgage demand to such a degree that an insufficient opportunity exists for a savings association to meet such investment requirements; or

(B) the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that

(i) the grant of any such exception will significantly facilitate an acquisition under section 1823(c) or 1823(k) of this title;

(ii) the acquired association will comply with the transition requirements of paragraph (7)(B), as if the date of the exemption were the starting date for the transition period described in that paragraph; and

(iii) the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that  7 the exemption will not have an undue adverse effect on competing savings associations in the relevant market and will further the purposes of this subsection.

(3) Failure to become and remain a qualified thrift lender

(A) In general

A savings association that fails to become or remain a qualified thrift lender shall immediately be subject to the restrictions under subparagraph (B).

(B) Restrictions applicable to savings associations that are not qualified thrift lenders

(i) Restrictions effective immediately

The following restrictions shall apply to a savings association beginning on the date on which the savings association should have become or ceases to be a qualified thrift lender:

(I) Activities

The savings association shall not make any new investment (including an investment in a subsidiary) or engage, directly or indirectly, in any other new activity unless that investment or activity would be permissible for the savings association if it were a national bank, and is also permissible for the savings association as a savings association.

(II) Branching

The savings association shall not establish any new branch office at any location at which a national bank located in the savings association’s home State may not establish a branch office. For purposes of this subclause, a savings association’s home State is the State in which the savings association’s total deposits were largest on the date on which the savings association should have become or ceased to be a qualified thrift lender.

(III) Dividends

The savings association may not pay dividends, except for dividends that

(aa) would be permissible for a national bank;

(bb) are necessary to meet obligations of a company that controls such savings association; and

(cc) are specifically approved by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board after a written request submitted to the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board by the savings association not later than 30 days before the date of the proposed payment.

(IV) Regulatory authority

A savings association that fails to become or remain a qualified thrift lender shall be deemed to have violated section 1464 of this title and subject to actions authorized by section 1464(d) of this title .

(ii) Additional restrictions effective after 3 years

Beginning 3 years after the date on which a savings association should have become a qualified thrift lender, or the date on which the savings association ceases to be a qualified thrift lender, as applicable, the savings association shall not retain any investment (including an investment in any subsidiary) or engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity, unless that investment or activity

(I) would be permissible for the savings association if it were a national bank; and

(II) is permissible for the savings association as a savings association.

(C) Holding company regulation

Any company that controls a savings association that is subject to any provision of subparagraph (B) shall, within one year after the date on which the savings association should have become or ceases to be a qualified thrift lender, register as and be deemed to be a bank holding company subject to all of the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [ 12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.], section 1818 of this title , and other statutes applicable to bank holding companies, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the company were a bank holding company and the savings association were a bank, as those terms are defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.

(D) Requalification

A savings association that should have become or ceases to be a qualified thrift lender shall not be subject to subparagraph (B) or (C) if the savings association becomes a qualified thrift lender by meeting the qualified thrift lender requirement in paragraph (1) on a monthly average basis in 9 out of the preceding 12 months and remains a qualified thrift lender. If the savings association (or any savings association that acquired all or substantially all of its assets from that savings association) at any time thereafter ceases to be a qualified thrift lender, it shall immediately be subject to all provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) as if all the periods described in subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C) had expired.

(E) Exemption for specialized savings associations serving certain military personnel
