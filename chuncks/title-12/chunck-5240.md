### CHAPTER 55— ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE (LIBOR)
#### § 5801. Findings and purpose
##### (a) Findings

Congress finds that

(1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in more than $200,000,000,000,000 worth of contracts worldwide;

(2) a significant number of existing contracts that reference LIBOR do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate when LIBOR is discontinued; and

(3) the cessation or nonrepresentativeness of LIBOR could result in disruptive litigation related to existing contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate.
