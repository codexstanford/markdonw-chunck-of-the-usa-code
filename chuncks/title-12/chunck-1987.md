#### § 1786. Termination of insured credit union status; cease and desist orders; removal or suspension from office; procedure
##### (c) Notice to members of termination of insured status

In the event of the termination of a credit union’s status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.
