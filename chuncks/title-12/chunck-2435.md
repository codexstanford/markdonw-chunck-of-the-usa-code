Transfers of eligible residential properties under this subsection may be conducted by direct sale, consignment sale, or any other method the Corporation considers appropriate and shall be subject to the following requirements:

The Corporation may transfer such properties individually or in bulk, as agreed to by the Corporation and the State housing finance agency or State or local housing agency.

The acquisition price paid by the State housing finance agency or State or local housing agency to the Corporation for properties transferred under this subsection shall be an amount agreed to by the Corporation and the transferee agency.

(3) Low-income use

Any State housing finance agency or State or local housing agency acquiring properties under this subsection shall offer to sell or transfer the properties only as follows:

(A) Eligible single family properties

For eligible single family properties

(i) to purchasers described under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (c)(2);

(ii) if the purchaser is a purchaser described under subsection (c)(2)(B)(i), subject to the rent limitations under subsection (e)(1);

(iii) subject to the requirement in the second sentence of subsection (c)(2); and

(iv) subject to recapture by the Corporation of excess proceeds from resale of the properties under paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (c).

(B) Eligible multifamily housing properties

For eligible multifamily housing properties

(i) to qualifying multifamily purchasers;

(ii) subject to the low-income occupancy requirements under subsection (d)(7);

(iii) subject to the provisions of subsection (d)(8);

(iv) subject to a preference, among financially acceptable offers, to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy or purchase by very low- and low-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest term; and

(v) subject to the rent limitations under subsection (e)(1).

(4) Affordability

The State housing finance agency or State or local housing agency shall endeavor to make the properties transferred under this subsection more affordable to low-income families based upon the extent to which the acquisition price of a property under paragraph (2) is less than the market value of the property.
