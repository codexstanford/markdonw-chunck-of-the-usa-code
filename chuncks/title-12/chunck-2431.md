##### (f) Preferences for sales

(1) In general

In selling any eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of eligible residential properties, the Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers, to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy or purchase by very low-income and low-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest term.

(2) Multiproperty purchases

The Corporation shall give preference, among substantially similar offers made under paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (d) to purchase more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, to offers made by purchasers who agree to maintain low-income occupancy in each separate property purchased in compliance with the levels required for properties under subsection (d)(7)(A).

(3) Definition of substantially similar offers

For purposes of this subsection, a given offer to purchase eligible multifamily housing property or combinations of such properties shall be considered to be substantially similar to another offer if the purchase price under such given offer is not less than 85 percent of the purchase price under the other offer.
