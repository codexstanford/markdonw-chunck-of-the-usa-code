### CHAPTER 23— FARM CREDIT SYSTEM
#### § 2266. Hearings and judicial review
##### (a) Venue; closed hearings; decisions and findings of fact; orders; modification or other action by Farm Credit Administration; judicial review

Any hearing provided for in this part (other than the hearing provided for in section 2265 of this title ) shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the home office of the institution is located unless the party afforded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. Such hearing shall be private, unless the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, after fully considering the views of the party afforded the hearing, determines that a public hearing is necessary to protect the public interest. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Farm Credit Administration has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, it shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this part. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this section. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided in subsection (b), and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Farm Credit Administration may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Farm Credit Administration may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.
