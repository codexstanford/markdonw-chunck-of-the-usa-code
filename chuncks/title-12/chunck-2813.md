### CHAPTER 23— FARM CREDIT SYSTEM
#### § 2202a. Restructuring distressed loans
##### (d) Consideration of applications

(1) In general

When a qualified lender receives an application for restructuring from a borrower, the qualified lender shall determine whether or not to restructure the loan, taking into consideration

(A) whether the cost to the lender of restructuring the loan is equal to or less than the cost of foreclosure;

(B) whether the borrower is applying all income over and above necessary and reasonable living and operating expenses to the payment of primary obligations;

(C) whether the borrower has the financial capacity and the management skills to protect the collateral from diversion, dissipation, or deterioration;

(D) whether the borrower is capable of working out existing financial difficulties, reestablishing a viable operation, and repaying the loan on a rescheduled basis; and

(E) in the case of a distressed loan that is not delinquent, whether restructuring consistent with sound lending practices may be taken to reasonably ensure that the loan will not become a loan that it is necessary to place in nonaccrual status.

(2) Applications not required for restructuring plans

This section shall not prevent a qualified lender from proposing a restructuring plan for an individual borrower in the absence of an application for restructuring from the borrower.
