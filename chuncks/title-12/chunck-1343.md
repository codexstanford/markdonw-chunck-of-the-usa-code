#### § 1715y. Mortgage insurance for condominiums
##### (c) Authorization; eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits

The Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe (including the minimum number of family units in the project which shall be offered for sale and provisions for the protection of the consumer and the public interest), to insure any mortgage covering a one-family unit in a multifamily project and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project, if (1) the mortgage meets the requirements of this subsection and of section 1709(b) of this title , except as that section is modified by this subsection, (2) at least 80 percent of the units in the project covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter are occupied by the mortgagors or comortgagors, and (3) the project has a blanket mortgage insured by the Secretary under subsection (d). Any project proposed to be constructed or rehabilitated after June 30, 1961 , with the assistance of mortgage insurance under this chapter, where the sale of family units is to be assisted with mortgage insurance under this subsection, shall be subject to such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this subsection, a mortgage shall (A) involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed the maximum principal obligation of a mortgage which may be insured in the area pursuant to section 1709(b)(2) of this title or pursuant to section 1709(h) of this title under the conditions described in section 1709(h) of this title , and (B) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage. The mortgage shall contain such provisions as the Secretary determines to be necessary for the maintenance of common areas and facilities and the multifamily project. The mortgagor shall have exclusive right to the use of the one-family unit covered by the mortgage and, together with the owners of other units in the multifamily project, shall have the right to the use of the common areas and facilities serving the project and the obligation of maintaining all such common areas and facilities. The Secretary may require that the rights and obligations of the mortgagor and the owners of other dwelling units in the project shall be subject to such controls as he determines to be necessary and feasible to promote and protect individual owners, the multifamily project, and its occupants. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe to permit one-family units and interests in common areas and facilities in multifamily projects covered by mortgages insured under any section of this chapter (other than section 1715e(a)(1) and (2) of this title) to be released from the liens of those mortgages.
