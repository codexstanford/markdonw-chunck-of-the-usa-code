(1) In general

Of amounts made available under section 115(a) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( Public Law 110–343 ) [ 12 U.S.C. 5225(a) ], $15,000,000 shall be made available to the Special Inspector General, which shall be in addition to amounts otherwise made available to the Special Inspector General.

(2) Priorities

In utilizing funds made available under this section, the Special Inspector General shall prioritize the performance of audits or investigations of recipients of non-recourse Federal loans made under any program that is funded in whole or in part by funds appropriated under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [ 12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.], to the extent that such priority is consistent with other aspects of the mission of the Special Inspector General. Such audits or investigations shall determine the existence of any collusion between the loan recipient and the seller or originator of the asset used as loan collateral, or any other conflict of interest that may have led the loan recipient to deliberately overstate the value of the asset used as loan collateral.
