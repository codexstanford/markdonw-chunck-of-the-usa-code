Agreements entered into under this subsection between the Secretary and a qualified housing finance agency shall specify the percentage of loss that each of the parties to the agreement will assume in the event of default of the insured multifamily mortgage.

(iv) Approval by States

In cases in which a unit of general local government carries out the responsibilities described in clause (i), the Secretary may permit the State to perform those actions of the Secretary described in clause (ii) and the performance of such actions by the State, where permitted by the Secretary, shall be deemed to satisfy the Secretary’s responsibilities referred to in the second sentence of clause (ii).

(C) Certification of subsidy layering compliance

The requirements of section 3545(d) of title 42 may be satisfied in connection with a commitment to insure a mortgage under this subsection by a certification by a housing credit agency (including an entity established by a State that provides mortgage insurance) to the Secretary that the combination of assistance within the jurisdiction of the Secretary and other government assistance provided in connection with a property for which a mortgage is to be insured shall not be any greater than is necessary to provide affordable housing.
