#### § 2279aa–12. Securities in credit enhanced pools
##### (a) Federal laws

(1) Applicability of certain Federal securities laws

For purposes of section 77c(a)(2) of title 15 , no security representing an interest in, or obligations backed by, a pool of qualified loans for which guarantees have been provided by the Corporation shall be deemed to be a security issued or guaranteed by a person controlled or supervised by, or acting as an instrumentality of, the Government of the United States. No such security shall be deemed to be a “government security” for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [ 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.] or for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 [ 15 U.S.C. 80a–1 et seq.].

(2) No full faith and credit of the United States

Each security for which credit enhancement has been provided by the Corporation shall clearly indicate that the security is not an obligation of, and is not guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the Farm Credit Administration, the United States, or any other agency or instrumentality of the United States (other than the Corporation).
