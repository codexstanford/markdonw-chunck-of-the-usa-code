##### (i) Insurance of mortgages executed by mortgagors meeting eligibility requirements for assistance payments; issuance of commitment; eligibility requirements for insurance

(1) The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure a mortgage (including advances with respect to property construction or rehabilitation pursuant to a self-help program) executed by a mortgagor who meets the eligibility requirements for assistance payments prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b). Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of section 1715 l (d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title, except as such requirements are modified by this subsection.

(3) A mortgage to be insured under this subsection shall

(A) involve a single-family or a two-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary prior to the beginning of construction or substantial rehabilitation, or a three-family dwelling which is approved by the Secretary prior to the beginning of substantial rehabilitation, or a one-family unit in a condominium project (together with an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities serving the project) which is released from a multi-family project, the construction or substantial rehabilitation of which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments with respect to such family unit and the unit has had no previous occupant other than the mortgagor: Provided , That the mortgage may involve an existing dwelling or a family unit in an existing condominium project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe: Provided further , That the mortgage may involve an existing dwelling or a family unit in an existing condominium proj­ect if assistance payments have been made on behalf of the previous owner of the dwelling or family unit with respect to a mortgage insured under subsection (j)(4): Provided further , That the mortgage may involve a dwelling unit in an existing project covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z–1 of this title or in an existing project receiving the benefits of financial assistance under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 [ 12 U.S.C. 1701s ];

(B) where it is to cover a one-family unit in a condominium project, have a principal obligation not exceeding $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that cost levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively;

(C) involve, in the case of a dwelling unit other than a condominium or cooperative unit, a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that cost levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively;

(D) involve, in the case of a two-family or three-family dwelling, a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $60,000 ($66,250 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that cost levels so require);

(E) be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid in cash or its equivalent, on account of the property, at least an amount equal to 3 per centum of the Secretary’s estimate of the cost of acquisition (excluding the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured); and

(F) bear interest at a rate not to exceed such percent per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time as the Secretary finds necessary to meet the mortgage market, taking into consideration the yields on mortgages in the primary and secondary markets.

(4) In insuring eligible mortgages under this subsection, the Secretary may not deny insurance on the basis that a mortgage involves a two- to three-family dwelling or is to be used to finance substantial rehabilitation rather than new construction.

(5) As a condition of insuring a mortgage on a two- to three-family dwelling, the Secretary shall require the mortgagor (A) not to discriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of their receipt of or eligibility for housing assistance under any Federal, State or local housing assistance program and (B) to agree that during the term of the mortgage each of the rental units shall be occupied by, or available for occupancy by, persons and families whose incomes do not exceed 100 per centum of the area median income.
