#### § 1831z. Bi-annual FDIC survey and report on encouraging use of depository institutions by the unbanked
##### (a) Survey required

(1) In general

The Corporation shall conduct a bi-annual survey on efforts by insured depository institutions to bring those individuals and families who have rarely, if ever, held a checking account, a savings account or other type of transaction or check cashing account at an insured depository institution (hereafter in this section referred to as the “unbanked”) into the conventional finance system.

(2) Factors and questions to consider

In conducting the survey, the Corporation shall take the following factors and questions into account:

(A) To what extent do insured depository institutions promote financial education and financial literacy outreach?

(B) Which financial education efforts appear to be the most effective in bringing “unbanked” individuals and families into the conventional finance system?

(C) What efforts are insured institutions making at converting “unbanked” money order, wire transfer, and international remittance customers into conventional account holders?

(D) What cultural, language and identification issues as well as transaction costs appear to most prevent “unbanked” individuals from establishing conventional accounts?

(E) What is a fair estimate of the size and worth of the “unbanked” market in the United States?
