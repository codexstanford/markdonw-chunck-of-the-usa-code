(B) necessary preconstruction costs incurred for architectural assistance, land options, application fees, and similar items; and

(C) the cost of carrying out programs providing counseling or similar services to lower income families for whom housing is being provided, in order to enable those families better to achieve and afford adequate housing, in such matters as home management, budget management, and home maintenance.

(2) In order to be eligible for a grant or loan under this subsection, the organization seeking such assistance shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Foundation that the funds requested are not otherwise available from Federal sources: Provided , That a grant or loan under this subsection may be provided to help cover that portion of the cost of an eligible activity not covered by Federal funds.

(3) The Foundation shall encourage cooperation between public and private organizations carrying out programs of homeownership and housing opportunity for lower income families and the neighborhoods and communities affected by such programs. To help assure such cooperation and in order to coordinate, to the maximum extent feasible, any construction or rehabilitation activities with the development goals of the neighborhood or community affected, no application for a loan or grant under this subsection shall be considered unless such application has been submitted to the governing body of the community affected, or to such other entity of local government as may be designated by the governing body, for such recommendations as the local governing body or its designee may desire to make. Any recommendations so made shall be given careful consideration by the Foundation before taking final action on any such application. If, upon the expiration of thirty days after any such application has been submitted to such governing body or its designee, such body or designee fails to provide such recommendations, the application may be considered without the benefit of such recommendations.
