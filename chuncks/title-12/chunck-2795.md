### CHAPTER 23— FARM CREDIT SYSTEM
#### § 2183. Dissolution; voluntary or involuntary liquidation; mergers; receiverships or conservators
##### (a) Voluntary liquidation; consent of Farm Credit Administration; rules and regulations; minimization of adverse effect; voluntary merger; mandatory merger on failure to comply or meet obligations

No institution of the System shall go into voluntary liquidation without the consent of the Farm Credit Administration and with such consent may liquidate only in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration. In the case of a voluntary liquidation of an association, such regulations, among other things, shall direct the supervising bank to institute such measures as it deems appropriate to minimize the adverse effect of the liquidation on those borrowers whose loans are purchased by or otherwise transferred to another System institution. The Farm Credit Administration Board may require an association to merge with another association whenever it determines, with the concurrence of the board of the supervising bank, that an association has failed to meet its outstanding obligations or failed to conduct its operations in accordance with this chapter.
