#### § 4632. Temporary cease-and-desist orders
##### (c) Incomplete or inaccurate records

(1) Temporary order

If a notice of charges served under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title specifies on the basis of particular facts and circumstances that the books and records of the regulated entity served are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Director is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of the regulated entity or the details or the purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that regulated entity, the Director may issue a temporary order requiring

(A) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or

(B) affirmative action to restore the books or records to a complete and accurate state.

(2) Effective period

Any temporary order issued under paragraph (1)

(A) shall become effective upon service; and

(B) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings pursuant to subsection (d), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of

(i) the completion of the proceeding initiated under section 4631 of this title in connection with the notice of charges; or

(ii) the date the Director determines, by examination or otherwise, that the books and records of the regulated entity are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the regulated entity.
