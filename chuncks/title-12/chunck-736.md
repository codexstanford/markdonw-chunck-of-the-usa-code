### CHAPTER 11— FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS
#### § 1426. Capital structure of Federal home loan banks
##### (d) Termination of membership

(1) Voluntary withdrawal

Any member may withdraw from a Federal home loan bank if the member provides written notice to the bank of its intent to do so and if, on the date of withdrawal, there is in effect a certification by the Director that the withdrawal will not cause the Federal Home Loan Bank System to fail to meet its obligation under section 1441b(f)(2)(C) of this title to contribute to the debt service for the obligations issued by the Resolution Funding Corporation. The applicable stock redemption notice periods shall commence upon receipt of the notice by the bank. Upon the expiration of the applicable notice period for each class of redeemable stock, the member may surrender such stock to the bank, and shall be entitled to receive in cash the par value of the stock. During the applicable notice periods, the member shall be entitled to dividends and other membership rights commensurate with continuing stock ownership.

(2) Involuntary withdrawal
