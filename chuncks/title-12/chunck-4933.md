##### (e) Board of Governors enforcement recommendations

(1) Recommendation

The Board of Governors may, after consulting with the Council and the Supervisory Agency, at any time recommend to the Supervisory Agency that such agency take enforcement action against a designated financial market utility in order to prevent or mitigate significant liquidity, credit, operational, or other risks to the financial markets or to the financial stability of the United States. Any such recommendation for enforcement action shall provide a detailed analysis supporting the recommendation of the Board of Governors.

(2) Consideration

The Supervisory Agency shall consider the recommendation of the Board of Governors and submit a response to the Board of Governors within 60 days.

If the Supervisory Agency rejects, in whole or in part, the recommendation of the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors may refer the recommendation to the Council for a binding decision on whether an enforcement action is warranted.

(4) Enforcement action

Upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the Council in favor of the Board of Governors’ recommendation under paragraph (3), the Council may require the Supervisory Agency to

(A) exercise the enforcement authority referenced in subsection (c); and

(B) take enforcement action against the designated financial market utility.
