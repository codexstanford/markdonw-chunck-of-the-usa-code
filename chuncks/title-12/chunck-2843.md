#### § 2218. Lines of insurance
##### (a) Regulatory authorization

(1) The regulations of the Farm Credit Administration governing financially related services that the banks and associations of the Farm Credit System may provide under subchapters I and II of this chapter may authorize the sale to any member of or borrower from any such bank or association, on an optional basis, of credit or term life and credit disability insurance appropriate to protect the loan commitment in the event of death or disability of the debtors and other insurance necessary to protect the member’s farm or aquatic unit, but limited to, hail and multiple-peril crop insurance, title insurance, and insurance to protect the facilities and equipment of aquatic borrowers. A member or borrower shall have the option, without coercion from the bank or association of such member or borrower, to accept or reject such insurance.

(2) In making insurance available through private insurers, the banks shall approve the programs of more than two insurers for each type of insurance offered in the district, if more than two insurers for each type of insurance have proposed programs to a bank that will, in all likelihood, have long-term viability and meet the requirements of subsection (b)(2)(D). The banks may provide comparative information relating to costs and quality of approved programs and the financial conditions of approved companies. Associations shall offer at least two insurers for each program from among those approved by the Farm Credit Banks, if at least two insurers have been approved in accordance with this paragraph.
