### CHAPTER 17— BANK HOLDING COMPANIES
#### § 1843. Interests in nonbanking organizations
##### (j) Notice procedures for nonbanking activities

(1) General notice procedure

(A) Notice requirement

Except as provided in paragraph (3), no bank holding company may engage in any nonbanking activity or acquire or retain ownership or control of the shares of a company engaged in activities based on subsection (c)(8) or (a)(2) or in any complementary activity under subsection (k)(1)(B) without providing the Board with written notice of the proposed transaction or activity at least 60 days before the transaction or activity is proposed to occur or commence.

(B) Contents of notice

The notice submitted to the Board shall contain such information as the Board shall prescribe by regulation or by specific request in connection with a particular notice.

(C) Procedure for agency action

(i) Notice of disapproval

Any notice filed under this subsection shall be deemed to be approved by the Board unless, before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date the Board receives a complete notice under subparagraph (A), the Board issues an order disapproving the transaction or activity and setting forth the reasons for disapproval.

(ii) Extension of period

The Board may extend the 60-day period referred to in clause (i) for an additional 30 days. The Board may further extend the period with the agreement of the bank holding company submitting the notice pursuant to this subsection.

(iii) Determination of period in case of public hearing

In the event a hearing is requested or the Board determines that a hearing is warranted, the Board may extend the notice period provided in this subsection for such time as is reasonably necessary to conduct a hearing and to evaluate the hearing record. Such extension shall not exceed the 91-day period beginning on the date that the hearing record is complete.

(D) Approval before end of period

(i) In general

Any transaction or activity may commence before the expiration of any period for disapproval established under this paragraph if the Board issues a written notice of approval.

(ii) Shorter periods by regulation

The Board may prescribe regulations which provide for a shorter notice period with respect to particular activities or transactions.

(E) Extension of period

In the case of any notice to engage in, or to acquire or retain ownership or control of shares of any company engaged in, any activity pursuant to subsection (c)(8) or (a)(2) or in any complementary activity under subsection (k)(1)(B) that has not been previously approved by regulation, the Board may extend the notice period under this subsection for an additional 90 days. The Board may further extend the period with the agreement of the bank holding company submitting the notice pursuant to this subsection.

(2) General standards for review

(A) Criteria

In connection with a notice under this subsection, the Board shall consider whether performance of the activity by a bank holding company or a subsidiary of such company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, unsound banking practices, or risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.

(B) Grounds for disapproval

The Board may deny any proposed transaction or activity for which notice has been submitted pursuant to this subsection if the bank holding company submitting such notice neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish the Board all the information required by the Board.

(C) Conditional action

Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the Board to impose conditions in connection with an action under this section.

(3) No notice required for certain transactions

No notice under paragraph (1) of this subsection or under subsection (c)(8) or (a)(2)(B) is required for a proposal by a bank holding company to engage in any activity, other than any complementary activity under subsection (k)(1)(B), or acquire the shares or assets of any company, other than an insured depository institution or a company engaged in any complementary activity under subsection (k)(1)(B), if the proposal qualifies under paragraph (4).

(4) Criteria for statutory approval

A proposal qualifies under this paragraph if all of the following criteria are met:

(A) Financial criteria

(i) the acquiring bank holding company is well capitalized;

(ii) the lead insured depository institution of such holding company is well capitalized;

(iii) well capitalized insured depository institutions control at least 80 percent of the aggregate total risk-weighted assets of insured depository institutions controlled by such holding company; and

(iv) no insured depository institution controlled by such holding company is undercapitalized.

(B) Managerial criteria

(i) Well managed

At the time of the transaction, the acquiring bank holding company, its lead insured depository institution, and insured depository institutions that control at least 90 percent of the aggregate total risk-weighted assets of insured depository institutions controlled by such holding company are well managed.

(ii) Limitation on poorly managed institutions

Except as provided in paragraph (6), no insured depository institution controlled by the acquiring bank holding company has received 1 of the 2 lowest composite ratings at the later of the institution’s most recent examination or subsequent review.

(C) Activities permissible

Following consummation of the proposal, the bank holding company engages directly or through a subsidiary solely in

(i) activities that are permissible under subsection (c)(8), as determined by the Board by regulation or order thereunder, subject to all of the restrictions, terms, and conditions of such subsection and such regulation or order; and

(ii) such other activities as are otherwise permissible under this section, subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions, including any prior notice or approval requirements, provided in this section.

(D) Size of acquisition

(i) Asset size

The book value of the total assets to be acquired does not exceed 10 percent of the consolidated total risk-weighted assets of the acquiring bank holding company.

(ii) Consideration

The gross consideration to be paid for the securities or assets does not exceed 15 percent of the consolidated Tier 1 capital of the acquiring bank holding company.

(E) Notice not otherwise warranted

For proposals described in paragraph (5)(B), the Board has not, before the conclusion of the period provided in paragraph (5)(B), advised the bank holding company that a notice under paragraph (1) is required.

(F) Compliance criterion

During the 12-month period ending on the date on which the bank holding company proposes to commence an activity or acquisition, no administrative enforcement action has been commenced, and no cease and desist order has been issued pursuant to section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1818 ], against the bank holding company or any depository institution subsidiary of the holding company, and no such enforcement action, order, or other administrative enforcement proceeding is pending as of such date.

(5) Notification

(A) Commencement of activities approved by rule

A bank holding company that qualifies under paragraph (4) and that proposes to engage de novo, directly or through a subsidiary, in any activity that is permissible under subsection (c)(8), as determined by the Board by regulation, may commence that activity without prior notice to the Board and must provide written notification to the Board not later than 10 business days after commencing the activity.

(B) Activities permitted by order and acquisitions

(i) In general

At least 12 business days before commencing any activity pursuant to paragraph (3) (other than an activity described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph) or acquiring shares or assets of any company pursuant to paragraph (3), the bank holding company shall provide written notice of the proposal to the Board, unless the Board determines that no notice or a shorter notice period is appropriate.

(ii) Description of activities and terms

A notification under this subparagraph shall include a description of the proposed activities and the terms of any proposed acquisition.

(6) Recently acquired institutions

Any insured depository institution which has been acquired by a bank holding company during the 12-month period preceding the date on which the company proposes to commence an activity or acquisition pursuant to paragraph (3) may be excluded for purposes of paragraph (4)(B)(ii) if

(A) the bank holding company has developed a plan for the institution to restore the capital and management of the institution which is acceptable to the appropriate Federal banking agency; and

The Board may, by regulation, adjust the percentages and the manner in which the percentages of insured depository institutions are calculated under paragraph (4)(B)(i), (4)(D), or (6)(B) if the Board determines that any such adjustment is consistent with safety and soundness and the purposes of this chapter.
