#### § 1818. Termination of status as insured depository institution
##### (m) Notice to State authorities

In connection with any proceeding under subsection (b), (c)(1), or (e) of this section involving an insured State bank or any institution-affiliated party, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall provide the appropriate State supervisory authority with notice of the agency’s intent to institute such a proceeding and the grounds therefor. Unless within such time as the Federal banking agency deems appropriate in the light of the circumstances of the case (which time must be specified in the notice prescribed in the preceding sentence) satisfactory corrective action is effectuated by action of the State supervisory authority, the agency may proceed as provided in this section. No bank or other party who is the subject of any notice or order issued by the agency under this section shall have standing to raise the requirements of this subsection as ground for attacking the validity of any such notice or order.
