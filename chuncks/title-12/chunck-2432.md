The Corporation shall establish a market value for each eligible multifamily housing property. The Corporation shall sell eligible multifamily housing property at the net realizable market value, except that the Corporation may agree to sell eligible multifamily housing property at a price below the net realizable market value to the extent necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of such property and enable a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the low-income occupancy requirements applicable to such property under subsection (d)(7). The Corporation may sell eligible single family property or eligible condominium property to qualifying households, nonprofit organizations, and public agencies without regard to any minimum sale price.

(B) Purchase loan

The Corporation may provide a loan at market interest rates to any purchaser of eligible residential property for all or a portion of the purchase price, which loan shall be secured by a first or second mortgage on the property. The Corporation may provide the loan at below market interest rates to the extent necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of eligible residential property and permit (i) a low-income family to purchase an eligible single family property under subsection (c), or (ii) a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the low-income occupancy requirements applicable to the purchase of an eligible residential property under subsection (c) or (d). The Corporation shall provide loans under this subparagraph in a form permitting sale or transfer of the loan to a subsequent holder. In providing financing for combinations of eligible multifamily housing properties under this section, the Corporation may hold a participating share, including a subordinate participation. The Corporation shall periodically provide, to a wide range of minority- and women-owned businesses engaged in providing affordable housing and to nonprofit organizations, more than 50 percent of the control of which is held by 1 or more minority individuals, that are engaged in providing affordable housing, information that is sufficient to inform such businesses and organizations of the availability and terms of financing under this subparagraph; such information may be provided directly, by notices published in periodicals and other publications that regularly provide information to such businesses or organizations, and through persons and organizations that regularly provide information or services to such businesses or organizations. For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “women-owned business” and “minority-owned business” have the meanings given such terms in section 1441a(r)  1 of this title, and the term “minority” has the meaning given such term in section 1204(c)(3) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.
