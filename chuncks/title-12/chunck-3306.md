#### § 3018. Loans
##### (b) Repayment requirements; criteria for terms, rates, and charges; advancement of loan proceeds

Loans under this section shall be repayable in not more than forty years and, except for loans with final due date not longer than five years from the date of the loan, shall be amortized as to principal and interest. In setting the terms, rates, and charges, it shall be the objective of the Bank to provide the type of credit needed by eligible borrowers, at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the cost of money to the Bank, necessary reserve and expenses of the Bank, and the technical and other assistance attributable to loans under this section made available by the Bank. The loan terms may provide for interest rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan in accordance with the rates being charged by the Bank for new loans at such times. The proceeds of a loan under this subsection may be advanced by the borrower to its members or stockholders under circumstances described in the bylaws or rules of the Bank.
