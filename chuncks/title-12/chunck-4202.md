Whenever any entity-affiliated party is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint, with the commission of or participation in a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year under Federal or State law, the Director may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the regulated entity or impair public confidence in the regulated entity, by written notice served upon such party, suspend such party from office or prohibit such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any regulated entity.

(B) Provisions applicable to notice

(i) Copy

A copy of any notice under subparagraph (A) shall be served upon the relevant regulated entity.

A suspension or prohibition under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint referred to in subparagraph (A) is finally disposed of, or until terminated by the Director.

(2) Removal or prohibition

(A) In general

If a judgment of conviction or an agreement to enter a pretrial diversion or other similar program is entered against an entity-affiliated party in connection with a crime described in paragraph (1)(A), at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Director may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the regulated entity or impair public confidence in the regulated entity, issue and serve upon such party an order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity without the prior written consent of the Director.

(B) Provisions applicable to order

If at any time, because of the suspension of 1 or more directors pursuant to this section, there shall be on the board of directors of a regulated entity less than a quorum of directors not so suspended, all powers and functions vested in or exercisable by such board shall vest in and be exercisable by the director or directors on the board not so suspended, until such time as there shall be a quorum of the board of directors.

(B) Appointment of temporary directors

If all of the directors of a regulated entity are suspended pursuant to this section, the Director shall appoint persons to serve temporarily as directors pending the termination of such suspensions, or until such time as those who have been suspended cease to be directors of the regulated entity and their respective successors take office.

(A) In general

Not later than 30 days after the date of service of any notice of suspension or order of removal issued pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), the entity-affiliated party may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the Director to show that the continued service or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity by such party does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interests of the regulated entity, or threaten to impair public confidence in the regulated entity.

Upon receipt of a request for a hearing under subparagraph (A), the Director shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of such request, unless extended at the request of such party) and place at which the entity-affiliated party may appear, personally or through counsel, before the Director or 1 or more designated employees of the Director to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Director, oral testimony) and oral argument.

(C) Determination

Not later than 60 days after the date of a hearing under subparagraph (B), the Director shall notify the entity-affiliated party whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity will be continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity will be rescinded or otherwise modified.
