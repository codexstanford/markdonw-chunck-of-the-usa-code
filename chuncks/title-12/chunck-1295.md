The mortgagor to whom the property is sold shall be regulated or supervised by the Secretary as provided in subsection (d)(3) to effectuate its purposes.

(2) The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.

The property or project shall comply with such standards and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe to establish the acceptability of such property for mortgage insurance and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants: Provided , That in the case of any such property or project located in an urban renewal area, the provisions of section 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iv) of this title shall apply with respect to the nondwelling facilities which may be included in the mortgage: Provided further , That, in the case of a mortgage which bears interest at the below-market interest rate prescribed in the proviso of subsection (d)(5), the provisions of section 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iv) of this title shall only apply if the mortgagor waives the right to receive dividends on its equity investment in the portion thereof devoted to commercial facilities.

A property or project covered by a mortgage insured under the provisions of subsection (d)(3) or (d)(4) shall include five or more family units: Provided , That such units, in the case of a project designed primarily for occupancy by displaced, elderly, or handicapped families, need not, with the approval of the Secretary, contain kitchen facilities, and such projects may include central dining and other shared facilities. The Secretary is authorized to adopt such procedures and requirements as he determines are desirable to assure that the dwelling accommodations provided under this section are available to displaced families. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Secretary, in order to assist further the provision of housing for low and moderate income families, in his discretion and under such conditions as he may prescribe, may insure a mortgage which meets the requirements of subsection (d)(3) of this section as in effect after June 30, 1961 , or which meets the requirements of subsection (h), (i), or (j) with no premium charge, with a reduced premium charge, or with a premium charge for such period or periods during the time the insurance is in effect as the Secretary may determine, and there is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as may be necessary to reimburse the General Insurance Fund for any net losses in connection with such insurance. Any person who is sixty-two years of age or over, or who is a handicapped person within the meaning of section 1701q  2 of this title, or who is a displaced person, shall be deemed to be a family within the meaning of the terms “family” and “families” as those terms are used in this section. Low- and moderate-income persons who are less than 62 years of age shall be eligible for occupancy of dwelling units in a project financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3). In any case in which it is determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary that facilities in existence or under construction on December 31, 1970 , which could appropriately be used for classroom purposes are available in any such property or project and that public schools in the community are overcrowded due in part to the attendance at such schools of residents of the property or project, such facilities may be used for such purposes to the extent permitted in such regulations (without being subject to any of the requirements of the proviso in section 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iv) of this title except the requirement that the project be predominantly residential).

As used in this section the terms “displaced family”, “displaced families”, and “displaced person” shall mean a family or families, or a person, displaced from an urban renewal area, or as a result of governmental action, or as a result of a major disaster as determined by the President pursuant to the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [ 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.].

Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be

(A) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f(c) ];

(B) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and

(C) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.

Assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437f ] shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.

(g) Entitlement of mortgagee to benefits; applicability of other provisions; debentures; “going Federal rate” defined; transfer of original credit instrument

The mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided

(1) as to mortgages meeting the requirements of paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of this section, paragraph (5) of subsection (h) of this section, or paragraph (2) of subsection (i) of this section, as provided in section 1710(a) of this title with respect to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title , and the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), 2 (j), and (k)  2 of section 1710 of this title shall be applicable to such mortgages insured under this section, except that all references therein to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund and all references therein to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section; or

(2) as to mortgages meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (d) of this section, paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this section, or paragraph (2) of subsection (j) of this section as provided in section 1713(g) of this title with respect to mortgages insured under said section 1713, and the provisions of subsections (h), (i), (j), (k), and ( l ) of section 1713 of this title shall be applicable to such mortgages insured under this section; or

(3) as to mortgages meeting the requirements of this section which are insured or initially endorsed for insurance on or after June 30, 1961 , notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such paragraphs in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire a mortgage loan that is in default and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary and made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage, and after the acquisition of any such mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the loan or the security for the loan. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this paragraph, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this paragraph, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages so acquired (A) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (B) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section. If the insurance is paid in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.

(4)(A) in the event any mortgage insured under this section pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into before November 30, 1983 , is not in default at the expiration of twenty years from the date the mortgage was endorsed for insurance, the mortgagee shall, within a period thereafter to be determined by the Secretary, have the option to assign, transfer, and deliver to the Secretary the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing the same and receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided in this paragraph, upon compliance with such requirements and conditions as to the validity of the mortgage as a first lien and such other matters as may be prescribed by the Secretary at the time the loan is endorsed for insurance. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee debentures having a par value equal to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the assignment, plus accrued interest to such date. Debentures issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be issued in the same manner and subject to the same terms and conditions as debentures issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that the debentures issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned to the Secretary, shall mature ten years after such date, and shall bear interest from such date at the going Federal rate determined at the time of issuance. The term “going Federal rate” as used herein means the annual rate of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify as applicable to the six-month period (consisting of January through June or July through December) which includes the issuance date of such debentures, which applicable rate for each such six-month period shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the month of May or the month of November, as the case may be, next preceding such six-month period, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of eight to twelve years from the first day of such month of May or November (or, if no such obligations are outstanding, the obligation next shorter than eight years and the obligation next longer than twelve years, respectively, shall be used), and by adjusting such estimated average annual yield to the nearest one-eight of 1 per centum. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to him under this paragraph as contained in sections 1713(k) and 1713( l ) of this title as to mortgages insured by the Secretary and assigned to him under section 1713 of this title .

(B) In processing a claim for insurance benefits under this paragraph, the Secretary may direct the mortgagee to assign, transfer, and deliver the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing it directly to the Government National Mortgage Association in lieu of assigning, transferring, and delivering the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Secretary. Upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery of the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Association, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall receive insurance benefits as provided in subparagraph (A). The Association is authorized to accept such loan documents in its own name and to hold, service, and sell such loans as agent for the Secretary. The mortgagor’s obligation to pay a service charge in lieu of a mortgage insurance premium shall continue as long as the mortgage is held by the Association or by the Secretary. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to the Secretary or the Association under this subparagraph as provided by section 1715n(c) of this title .

(C)(i) In lieu of accepting assignment of the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument under subparagraph (A) in exchange for receipt of debentures, the Secretary shall arrange for the sale of the beneficial interests in the mortgage loan through an auction and sale of the (I) mortgage loans, or (II) participation certificates, or other mortgage-backed obligations in a form acceptable to the Secretary (in this subparagraph referred to as “participation certificates”). The Secretary shall arrange the auction and sale at a price, to be paid to the mortgagee, of par plus accrued interest to the date of sale. The sale price shall also include the right to a subsidy payment described in clause (iii).

(ii)(I) The Secretary shall conduct a public auction to determine the lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the beneficial interests in the original credit instrument and mortgage securing the credit instrument.

(II) A mortgagee who elects to assign a mortgage shall provide the Secretary and persons bidding at the auction a description of the characteristics of the original credit instrument and mortgage securing the original credit instrument, which shall include the principal mortgage balance, original stated interest rate, service fees, real estate and tenant characteristics, the level and duration of applicable Federal subsidies, and any other information determined by the Secretary to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also provide information regarding the status of the property with respect to the provisions of the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act with respect to eligibility to prepay the mortgage, a statement of whether the owner has filed a notice of intent to prepay or a plan of action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act, and the details with respect to incentives provided under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act in lieu of exercising prepayment rights.

(III) The Secretary shall, upon receipt of the information in subclause (II), promptly advertise for an auction and publish such mortgage descriptions in advance of the auction. The Secretary may conduct the auction at any time during the 6-month period beginning upon receipt of the information in subclause (II) but under no circumstances may the Secretary conduct an auction before 2 months after receiving the mortgagee’s written notice of intent to assign its mortgage to the Secretary.

(IV) In any auction under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall accept the lowest interest rate bid for purchase that the Secretary determines to be acceptable. The Secretary shall cause the accepted bid to be published in the Federal Register. Settlement for the sale of the credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument shall occur not later than 30 business days after the date winning bidders are selected in the auction, unless the Secretary determines that extraordinary circumstances require an extension (not to exceed 60 days) of the period.

(V) If no bids are received, the bids that are received are not acceptable to the Secretary, or settlement does not occur within the period under subclause (IV), the mortgagee shall retain all rights (including the right to interest, at a rate to be determined by the Secretary, for the period covering any actions taken under this subparagraph) under this section to assign the mortgage loan to the Secretary.

(iii) As part of the auction process, the Secretary shall agree to provide a monthly interest subsidy payment from the General Insurance Fund to the purchaser under the auction of the original credit instrument or the mortgage securing the credit instrument (and any subsequent holders or assigns who are approved mortgagees). The subsidy payment shall be paid on the first day of each month in an amount equal to the difference between the stated interest due on the mortgage loan and the lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the mortgage loan or participation certificates (less the servicing fee, if appropriate) for the then unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest at a rate determined by the Secretary. Each interest subsidy payment shall be treated by the holder of the mortgage as interest paid on the mortgage. The interest subsidy payment shall be provided until the earlier of

(I) the maturity date of the loan;

(II) prepayment of the mortgage loan in accordance with the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act, where applicable; or

(III) default and full payment of insurance benefits on the mortgage loan by the Federal Housing Administration.

(iv) The Secretary shall require that the mortgage loans or participation certificates presented for assignment are auctioned as whole loans with servicing rights released and also are auctioned with servicing rights retained by the current servicer.

(v) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall encourage State housing finance agencies, nonprofit organizations, and organizations representing the tenants of the property securing the mortgage, or a qualified mortgagee participating in a plan of action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act to participate in the auction.

(vi) The Secretary shall implement the requirements imposed by this subparagraph within 30 days from November 5, 1990 , and not be subject to the requirement of prior issuance of regulations in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall issue regulations implementing this section within 6 months of November 5, 1990 .

(vii) Nothing in this subparagraph shall diminish or impair the low income use restrictions applicable to the project under the original regulatory agreement or the revised agreement entered into pursuant to the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act, if any, or other agreements for the provision of Federal assistance to the housing or its tenants.

(viii) This subparagraph shall not apply after December 31, 2002 , except that this subparagraph shall continue to apply if the Secretary receives a mortgagee’s written notice of intent to assign its mortgage to the Secretary on or before such date. Not later than January 31 of each year (beginning in 1992), the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report including statements of the number of mortgages auctioned and sold and their value, the amount of subsidies committed to the program under this subparagraph, the ability of the Secretary to coordinate the program with the incentives provided under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act, and the costs and benefits derived from the program for the Federal Government.

(ix) The authority of the Secretary to conduct multifamily auctions under this paragraph shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as are approved in appropriations Acts for the costs of loan guarantees (as defined in section 661a of title 2 ), including the cost of modifying loans.

(h) Insurance of mortgages to finance purchase and rehabilitation by nonprofit organizations of housing for resale to low-income purchasers, and insurance of mortgages executed for the purpose of financing rehabilitation or improvement of dwellings owned and occupied by mortgagors who purchased from nonprofit organizations

(1) In addition to mortgages insured under the other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this subsection as hereinafter provided any mortgage (including advances under such mortgage during rehabilitation) which is executed by a nonprofit organization to finance the purchase and rehabilitation of deteriorating or substandard housing for subsequent resale to low-income home purchasers and, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insurance of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon.

(2) To be eligible for insurance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a mortgage shall

(A) be executed by a private nonprofit corporation or association, approved by the Secretary, for financing the purchase and rehabilitation (with the intention of subsequent resale) of property comprising one or more tracts or parcels, whether or not contiguous, upon which there is located deteriorating or substandard housing consisting of (i) four or more single-family dwellings of detached, semidetached, or row construction, or (ii) four or more one-family units in a structure or structures for which a plan of family unit ownership approved by the Secretary is established;

(F) provide for the release of individual single-family dwellings from the lien of the mortgage upon the sale of the rehabilitated dwellings in accordance with paragraph (5).

(4) The aggregate principal balance of all mortgages insured under paragraph (1) and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $50,000,000.

(5)(A) No mortgage shall be insured under paragraph (1) unless the mortgagor enters into an agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary) that it will offer to sell the dwellings involved, upon completion of their rehabilitation, to individuals or families (hereinafter referred to as “low-income purchasers”) determined by the Secretary to have incomes below the maximum amount specified (with respect to the area involved) in section 1701s(c)(1) of this title .

(B) The Secretary is authorized to insure under this paragraph mortgages executed to finance the sale of individual dwellings to low-income purchasers as provided in subparagraph (A). Any such mortgage shall

(i) be in a principal amount equal to that portion of the unpaid balance of the principal mortgage covering the property (insured under paragraph (1)) which is allocable to the individual dwelling involved; and

(ii) bear interest at the same rate as the principal mortgage or such lower rate, not less than 1 per centum, as the Secretary may prescribe if in his judgment the purchaser’s income is sufficiently low to justify the lower rate, and provide for complete amortization within a term equal to the remaining term (determined without regard to subparagraph (E)) of such principal mortgage: Provided , That, if the rate of interest initially prescribed is less than the rate borne by the principal mortgage and the purchaser’s income (as determined on the basis of periodic review) subsequently rises, the rate of interest so prescribed shall be increased (but not above the rate borne by such principal mortgage), under regulations of the Secretary, to the extent appropriate to reflect the increase in such income, and the mortgage shall so provide.

To be eligible for such insurance, a mortgage shall

(A) be in a principal amount not exceeding the lesser of $18,000 or the sum of the estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation and the Secretary’s estimate of the value of the property before repair and rehabilitation, except that in no case involving refinancing shall such mortgage exceed such estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation and the amount (as determined by the Secretary) required to refinance existing indebtedness secured by the property;

(B) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance and service charge, if any) at 3 per centum per annum or such lower rate, not less than 1 per centum, as the Secretary may prescribe if in his judgment the mortgagor’s income is sufficiently low to justify the lower rate: Provided , That, if the rate of interest initially prescribed is less than 3 per centum per annum and the mortgagor’s income (as determined on the basis of periodic review) subsequently rises, the rate shall be increased (but not above 3 per centum), under regulations of the Secretary, to the extent appropriate to reflect the increase in such income, and the mortgage shall so provide;

(C) involve a mortgagor that shall have paid on account of the property at the time of the rehabilitation such amount (which shall not be less than $200 in cash or its equivalent, but which may be applied in whole or in part toward closing costs) as the Secretary may determine to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances; and

(D) contain a provision that, if the low-income mortgagor does not continue to occupy the property, the interest rate shall increase to the highest rate permissible under this section and the regulations of the Secretary effective at the time the commitment was issued for insurance of the mortgage; except that the increase in interest rate shall not be applicable if the property is sold and the purchaser is (i) a nonprofit organization which has been engaged in purchasing and rehabilitating deteriorating and substandard housing with financing under a mortgage insured under paragraph (1) of this subsection, (ii) a public housing agency having jurisdiction under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] over the area where the dwelling is located, or (iii) a low-income purchaser approved for the purposes of this paragraph by the Secretary.

(7) Where the Secretary has approved a plan of family unit ownership, the terms “single-family dwelling”, “single-family dwellings”, “individual dwelling”, and “individual dwellings” shall mean a family unit or family units, together with the undivided interest (or interests) in the common areas and facilities.

(8) For purposes of this subsection, the terms “single-family dwelling” and “single-family dwellings” (except for purposes of paragraph (7)) shall include a two-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary.

(3) Upon the sale of all of the family units covered by the project mortgage, and the release of all of the family units (including the undivided interest allocable to each unit in the common areas and facilities) from the lien of the project mortgage, the insurance of the proj­ect mortgage shall be terminated and no adjusted premium charge shall be collected by the Secretary upon such termination.

(4) Any mortgage covering an individual family unit insured under this subsection shall contain a provision that, if the original mortgagor does not continue to occupy the property, the interest rate shall increase to the highest rate permissible under this section and the regulations of the Secretary effective at the time the commitment was issued for the insurance of the project mortgage; except that the requirement for an increase in interest rate shall not be applicable if the property is sold and the purchaser is (i) a nonprofit purchaser approved by the Secretary, or (ii) a low or moderate income purchaser who has an income within the limits prescribed by the Secretary for occupants of projects financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3) which bears interest at the below-market rate prescribed in the proviso of subsection (d)(5).
