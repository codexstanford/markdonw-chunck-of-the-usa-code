### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1828. Regulations governing insured depository institutions
##### (m) Activities of savings associations and their subsidiaries

(1) Procedures

When an insured savings association establishes or acquires a subsidiary or when an insured savings association elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the insured savings association controls, the insured savings association

(A) shall notify the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, not less than 30 days prior to the establishment, or acquisition, of any such subsidiary, and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of any such activity, and in either case shall provide at that time such information as each such agency may, by regulation, require; and

(B) shall conduct the activities of the subsidiary in accordance with regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency and orders of the Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency.

(2) Enforcement powers

With respect to any subsidiary of an insured savings association:

(A) the Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, shall each have, with respect to such subsidiary, the respective powers that each has with respect to the insured savings association pursuant to this section or section 1818 of this title ; and

(B) the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, may determine, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the continuation by the insured savings association of its ownership or control of, or its relationship to, the subsidiary

(i) constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness, or stability of the insured savings association, or

(ii) is inconsistent with sound banking principles or with the purposes of this chapter. Upon making any such determination, the Corporation or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, shall have authority to order the insured savings association to divest itself of control of the subsidiary. The Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, may take any other corrective measures with respect to the subsidiary, including the authority to require the subsidiary to terminate the activities or operations posing such risks, as the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, respectively, may deem appropriate.

(3) Activities incompatible with deposit insurance

(A) In general

The Corporation may determine by regulation or order that any specific activity poses a serious threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Prior to adopting any such regulation, the Corporation shall, in the case of a Federal savings association, consult with the Comptroller of the Currency and shall provide appropriate State supervisors the opportunity to comment thereon, and the Corporation shall specifically take such comments into consideration. Any such regulation shall be issued in accordance with section 553 of title 5 . If the Board of Directors makes such a determination with respect to an activity, the Corporation shall have authority to order that no savings association may engage in the activity directly.

(B) Authority of Comptroller of the Currency

This section does not limit the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency to issue regulations to promote safety and soundness, or to enforce compliance as to Federal savings associations with other applicable laws.

(C) Additional authority of FDIC to prevent serious risks to insurance fund

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Corporation may prescribe and enforce such regulations and issue such orders as the Corporation determines to be necessary to prevent actions or practices of savings associations that pose a serious threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(4) “Subsidiary” defined

As used in this subsection, the term “subsidiary” does not include an insured depository institution.

(5) Applicability to certain savings banks

Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection do not apply to

(A) any Federal savings bank that was chartered prior to October 15, 1982 , as a savings bank under State law, or

(B) a savings association that acquired its principal assets from an institution that was chartered prior to October 15, 1982 , as a savings bank under State law.
