### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1831u. Interstate bank mergers
##### (b) Provisions relating to application and approval process

(1) Compliance with State filing requirements

(A) In general

Any bank which files an application for an interstate merger transaction shall

(i) comply with the filing requirements of any host State of the bank which will result from such transaction to the extent that the requirement

(I) does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks or out-of-State bank holding companies or subsidiaries of such banks or bank holding companies; and

(II) is similar in effect to any requirement imposed by the host State on a nonbanking corporation incorporated in another State that engages in business in the host State; and

(ii) submit a copy of the application to the State bank supervisor of the host State.

(B) Penalty for failure to comply

The responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the applicant materially fails to comply with subparagraph (A).

(2) Concentration limits

(A) Nationwide concentration limits

The responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the resulting bank (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the resulting bank), upon consummation of the transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.

(B) Statewide concentration limits other than with respect to initial entries

The responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if

(i) any bank involved in the transaction (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of any such bank) has a branch in any State in which any other bank involved in the transaction has a branch; and

(ii) the resulting bank (including all insured depository institutions which would be affiliates of the resulting bank), upon consummation of the transaction, would control 30 percent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in any such State.

(C) Effectiveness of State deposit caps

No provision of this subsection shall be construed as affecting the authority of any State to limit, by statute, regulation, or order, the percentage of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the State which may be held or controlled by any bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding company) to the extent the application of such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.

(D) Exceptions to subparagraph (B)

The responsible agency may approve an application for an interstate merger transaction pursuant to subsection (a) without regard to the applicability of subparagraph (B) with respect to any State if

(i) there is a limitation described in subparagraph (C) in a State statute, regulation, or order which has the effect of permitting a bank or bank holding company (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the bank or bank holding company) to control a greater percentage of total deposits of all insured depository institutions in the State than the percentage permitted under subparagraph (B); or

(ii) the transaction is approved by the appropriate State bank supervisor of such State and the standard on which such approval is based does not have the effect of discriminating against out-of-State banks, out-of-State bank holding companies, or subsidiaries of such banks or holding companies.

(E) Exception for certain banks

This paragraph shall not apply with respect to any interstate merger transaction involving only affiliated banks.

(3) Community reinvestment compliance

In determining whether to approve an application for an interstate merger transaction in which the resulting bank would have a branch or bank affiliate immediately following the transaction in any State in which the bank submitting the application (as the acquiring bank) had no branch or bank affiliate immediately before the transaction, the responsible agency shall

(A) comply with the responsibilities of the agency regarding such application under section 2903 of this title ;

(B) take into account the most recent written evaluation under section 2903 of this title of any bank which would be an affiliate of the resulting bank; and

(C) take into account the record of compliance of any applicant bank with applicable State community reinvestment laws.

(4) Adequacy of capital and management skills

The responsible agency may approve an application for an interstate merger transaction pursuant to subsection (a) only if

(A) each bank involved in the transaction is adequately capitalized as of the date the application is filed; and

(B) the responsible agency determines that the resulting bank will be well capitalized and well managed upon the consummation of the transaction.

(5) Surrender of charter after merger transaction

The charters of all banks involved in an interstate merger transaction, other than the charter of the resulting bank, shall be surrendered, upon request, to the Federal banking agency or State bank supervisor which issued the charter.
