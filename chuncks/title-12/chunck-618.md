### CHAPTER 6A— EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES
#### § 635i–9. Market windows
##### (a) Enhanced transparency

To ensure that the Bank financing remains fully competitive, the United States should seek enhanced transparency over the activities of market windows in the OECD Export Credit Arrangement. If such transparency indicates that market windows are disadvantaging United States exporters, the United States should seek negotiations for multilateral disciplines and transparency within the OECD Export Credit Arrangement.
