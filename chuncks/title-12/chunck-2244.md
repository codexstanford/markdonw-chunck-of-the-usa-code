(1) In general

(A) Acquisitions authorized

(i) Transactions described

Notwithstanding any provision of State law, upon determining that severe financial conditions threaten the stability of a significant number of savings associations, or of savings associations possessing significant financial resources, the Corporation, in its discretion and if it determines such authorization would lessen the risk to the Corporation, may authorize

(I) a savings association that is eligible for assistance pursuant to subsection (c) to merge or consolidate with, or to transfer its assets and liabilities to, any other savings association or any insured bank,

(II) any other savings association to acquire control of such savings association, or

(III) any company to acquire control of such savings association or to acquire the assets or assume the liabilities thereof.  The Corporation may not authorize any transaction under this subsection unless the Corporation determines that the authorization will not present a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the savings association to be acquired or any acquiring entity.

(ii) Terms of transactions

Mergers, consolidations, transfers, and acquisitions under this subsection shall be on such terms as the Corporation shall provide.

(iii) Approval by appropriate agency

Where otherwise required by law, transactions under this subsection must be approved by the appropriate Federal banking agency of every party thereto.

(iv) Acquisitions by savings associations

Any Federal savings association that acquires another savings association pursuant to clause (i) may, with the concurrence of the Comptroller of the Currency, hold that savings association as a subsidiary notwithstanding the percentage limitations of section 1464(c)(4)(B) of this title .

(v) Dual service

Dual service by a management official that would otherwise be prohibited under the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act [ 12 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.] may, with the approval of the Corporation, continue for up to 10 years.

(vi) Continued applicability of certain State restrictions

Nothing in this subsection overrides or supersedes State laws restricting or limiting the activities of a savings association on behalf of another entity.

(B) Consultation with State official

(i) Consultation required

Before making a determination to take any action under subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall consult the State official having jurisdiction of the acquired institution.

(ii) Period for State response

The official shall be given a reasonable opportunity, and in no event less than 48 hours, to object to the use of the provisions of this paragraph. Such notice may be provided by the Corporation prior to its appointment as receiver, but in anticipation of an impending appointment.

(iii) Approval over objection of State official

If the official objects during such period, the Corporation may use the authority of this paragraph only by a vote of 75 percent or more of the voting members of the Board of Directors. The Corporation shall provide to the official, as soon as practicable, a written certification of its determination.

(2) Solicitation of offers

(A) In general

In considering authorizations under this subsection, the Corporation may solicit such offers or proposals as are practicable from any prospective purchasers or merger partners it determines, in its sole discretion, are both qualified and capable of acquiring the assets and liabilities of the savings association.

(B) Minority-controlled institutions

In the case of a minority-controlled depository institution, the Corporation shall seek an offer from other minority-controlled depository institutions before seeking an offer from other persons or entities.

(3) Determination of costs

In determining the cost of offers under this subsection, the Corporation’s calculations and estimations shall be determinative. The Corporation may set reasonable time limits on offers.

(4) Branching provisions

(A) In general

If a merger, consolidation, transfer, or acquisition under this subsection involves a savings association eligible for assistance and a bank or bank holding company, a savings association may retain and operate any existing branch or branches or any other existing facilities. If the savings association continues to exist as a separate entity, it may establish and operate new branches to the same extent as any savings association that is not affiliated with a bank holding company and the home office of which is located in the same State.

(B) Restrictions

(i) In general

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if

(I) a savings association described in such subparagraph does not have its home office in the State of the bank holding company bank subsidiary, and

(II) such association does not qualify as a domestic building and loan association under section 7701(a)(19) of title 26 , or does not meet the asset composition test imposed by subparagraph (C) of that section on institutions seeking so to qualify,  such savings association shall be subject to the conditions upon which a bank may retain, operate, and establish branches in the State in which the savings association is located.

(ii) Transition period

The Corporation, for good cause shown, may allow a savings association up to 2 years to comply with the requirements of clause (i).

(5) Assistance before appointment of conservator or receiver

(A) Assistance proposals

The Corporation shall consider proposals by savings associations for assistance pursuant to subsection (c) before grounds exist for appointment of a conservator or receiver for such member under the following circumstances:

(i) Troubled condition criteria

The Corporation determines

(I) that grounds for appointment of a conservator or receiver exist or likely will exist in the future unless the member’s tangible capital is increased;

(II) that it is unlikely that the member can achieve positive tangible capital without assistance; and

(III) that providing assistance pursuant to the member’s proposal would be likely to lessen the risk to the Corporation.

(ii) Other criteria

The member meets the following criteria:

(I) Before August 9, 1989 , the member was solvent under applicable regulatory accounting principles but had negative tangible capital.

(II) The member’s negative tangible capital position is substantially attributable to its participation in acquisition and merger transactions that were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for supervisory reasons.

(III) The member is a qualified thrift lender (as defined in section 1467a(m) of this title ) or would be a qualified thrift lender if commercial real estate owned and nonperforming commercial loans acquired in acquisition and merger transactions that were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for supervisory reasons were excluded from the member’s total assets.

(IV) The appropriate Federal banking agency has determined that the member’s management is competent and has complied with applicable laws, rules, and supervisory directives and orders.

(V) The member’s management did not engage in insider dealing or speculative practices or other activities that jeopardized the member’s safety and soundness or contributed to its impaired capital position.

(VI) The member’s offices are located in an economically depressed region.

(B) Corporation consideration of assistance proposal

If a member meets the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall consider providing direct financial assistance.

(C) “Economically depressed region” defined

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “economically depressed region” means any geographical region which the Corporation determines by regulation to be a region within which real estate values have suffered serious decline due to severe economic conditions, such as a decline in energy or agricultural values or prices.
