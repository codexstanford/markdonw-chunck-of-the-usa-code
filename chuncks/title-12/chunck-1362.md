(1) In addition to mortgages insured under the provisions of subsection (i), the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure a mortgage (including advances under such mortgage during rehabilitation) which is executed by a nonprofit organization or public body or agency to finance the purchase of housing, and the rehabilitation of such housing if it is deteriorating or substandard, for subsequent resale to lower income home purchasers who meet the eligibility requirements for assistance payments prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b). Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(2) To be eligible for insurance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a mortgage shall

(A) be executed by a private nonprofit organization or public body or agency, approved by the Secretary, for the purpose of financing the purchase (with the intention of subsequent resale), and rehabilitation where the housing involved is deteriorating or substandard, of property comprising one or more tracts or parcels, whether or not contiguous, consisting of (i) four or more single-family dwellings of detached, semidetached, or row construction, or (ii) four or more one-family units in a structure or structures for which a plan of family unit ownership approved by the Secretary is established; except that in a case not involving the rehabilitation of deteriorating or substandard housing the property purchased may consist of one or more such dwellings or units;

(B) be in a principal amount not exceeding the appraised value of the property at the time of its purchase under the mortgage plus the estimated cost of any rehabilitation;

(C) bear interest at a rate not to exceed such percent per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time as the Secretary determines is necessary to meet the mortgage market, taking into consideration the yields on mortgages in the primary and secondary markets;

(D) provide for complete amortization (subject to paragraph (4)(E)) by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary may prescribe; and

(E) provide for the release of individual single-family dwellings from the lien of the mortgage upon their sale in accordance with paragraph (4).

(3) No mortgage shall be insured under paragraph (1) unless the mortgagor shall have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that (A) the property involved is located in a neighborhood which is sufficiently stable and contains sufficient public facilities and amenities to support long-term values, or (B) the purchase or rehabilitation of such property plus the mortgagor’s related activities and the activities of other owners of housing in the neighborhood, together with actions to be taken by public authorities, will be of such scope and quality as to give reasonable promise that a stable environment will be created in the neighborhood.

(4)

(A) No mortgage shall be insured under paragraph (1) unless the mortgagor enters into an agreement, satisfactory to the Secretary, that it will offer to sell the dwellings involved, after purchase and upon completion of any rehabilitation, to lower income individuals or families meeting the eligibility requirements established by the Secretary under subsection (b).
