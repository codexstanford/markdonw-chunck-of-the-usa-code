##### (o) Assessments

(1) Risk-based assessments

(A) Eligible financial companies defined

For purposes of this subsection, the term “eligible financial company” means any bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.

(B) Assessments

The Corporation shall charge one or more risk-based assessments in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (D), if such assessments are necessary to pay in full the obligations issued by the Corporation to the Secretary under this subchapter within 60 months of the date of issuance of such obligations.

(C) Extensions authorized

The Corporation may, with the approval of the Secretary, extend the time period under subparagraph (B), if the Corporation determines that an extension is necessary to avoid a serious adverse effect on the financial system of the United States.

(D) Application of assessments

To meet the requirements of subparagraph (B), the Corporation shall

(i) impose assessments, as soon as practicable, on any claimant that received additional payments or amounts from the Corporation pursuant to subsection (b)(4), (d)(4), or (h)(5)(E), except for payments or amounts necessary to initiate and continue operations essential to implementation of the receivership or any bridge financial company, to recover on a cumulative basis, the entire difference between

(I) the aggregate value the claimant received from the Corporation on a claim pursuant to this subchapter (including pursuant to subsection  4 (b)(4), (d)(4), and (h)(5)(E)), as of the date on which such value was received; and

(II) the value the claimant was entitled to receive from the Corporation on such claim solely from the proceeds of the liquidation of the covered financial company under this subchapter; and

(ii) if the amounts to be recovered on a cumulative basis under clause (i) are insufficient to meet the requirements of subparagraph (B), after taking into account the considerations set forth in paragraph (4), impose assessments on

(I) eligible financial companies; and

(II) financial companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 that are not eligible financial companies.

(E) Provision of financing

Payments or amounts necessary to initiate and continue operations essential to implementation of the receivership or any bridge financial company described in subparagraph (D)(i) shall not include the provision of financing, as defined by rule of the Corporation, to third parties.

(2) Graduated assessment rate

The Corporation shall impose assessments on a graduated basis, with financial companies having greater assets and risk being assessed at a higher rate.

(3) Notification and payment

The Corporation shall notify each financial company of that company’s assessment under this subsection. Any financial company subject to assessment under this subsection shall pay such assessment in accordance with the regulations prescribed pursuant to paragraph (6).

(4) Risk-based assessment considerations

In imposing assessments under paragraph (1)(D)(ii), the Corporation shall use a risk matrix. The Council shall make a recommendation to the Corporation on the risk matrix to be used in imposing such assessments, and the Corporation shall take into account any such recommendation in the establishment of the risk matrix to be used to impose such assessments. In recommending or establishing such risk matrix, the Council and the Corporation, respectively, shall take into account

(A) economic conditions generally affecting financial companies so as to allow assessments to increase during more favorable economic conditions and to decrease during less favorable economic conditions;

(B) any assessments imposed on a financial company or an affiliate of a financial company that

(i) is an insured depository institution, assessed pursuant to section 1817 or 1823(c)(4)(G) of this title;

(iv) is an insurance company, assessed pursuant to applicable State law to cover (or reimburse payments made to cover) the costs of the rehabilitation, liquidation, or other State insolvency proceeding with respect to 1 or more insurance companies;

(C) the risks presented by the financial company to the financial system and the extent to which the financial company has benefitted, or likely would benefit, from the orderly liquidation of a financial company under this subchapter, including

(i) the amount, different categories, and concentrations of assets of the financial company and its affiliates, including both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets;

(ii) the activities of the financial company and its affiliates;

(iii) the relevant market share of the financial company and its affiliates;

(iv) the extent to which the financial company is leveraged;

(v) the potential exposure to sudden calls on liquidity precipitated by economic distress;

(vi) the amount, maturity, volatility, and stability of the company’s financial obligations to, and relationship with, other financial companies;

(vii) the amount, maturity, volatility, and stability of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding, taking into consideration existing systems for measuring a company’s risk-based capital;

(viii) the stability and variety of the company’s sources of funding;

(ix) the company’s importance as a source of credit for households, businesses, and State and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the financial system;

(x) the extent to which assets are simply managed and not owned by the financial company and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse; and

(xi) the amount, different categories, and concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured, contingent and noncontingent, including both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities, of the financial company and its affiliates;

(D) any risks presented by the financial company during the 10-year period immediately prior to the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial company that contributed to the failure of the covered financial company; and

(E) such other risk-related factors as the Corporation, or the Council, as applicable, may determine to be appropriate.

The Corporation may impose on covered financial companies such collection of information requirements as the Corporation deems necessary to carry out this subsection after the appointment of the Corporation as receiver under this subchapter.

(6) Rulemaking

(A) In general

The Corporation shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subsection. The Corporation shall consult with the Secretary in the development and finalization of such regulations.

(B) Equitable treatment

The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) shall take into account the differences in risks posed to the financial stability of the United States by financial companies, the differences in the liability structures of financial companies, and the different bases for other assessments that such financial companies may be required to pay, to ensure that assessed financial companies are treated equitably and that assessments under this subsection reflect such differences.
