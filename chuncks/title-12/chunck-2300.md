(7) Consideration of rehabilitation

Consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), the Corporation shall

In carrying out this section, the Corporation shall consult and coordinate with the National Credit Union Administration as needed to promote consistent implementation where appropriate.
