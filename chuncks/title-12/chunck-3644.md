#### § 3904. Reserves
##### (a) Establishment and maintenance of special reserves

(1) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall require a banking institution to establish and maintain a special reserve whenever, in the judgment of such appropriate Federal banking agency

(A) the quality of such banking institution’s assets has been impaired by a protracted inability of public or private borrowers in a foreign country to make payments on their external indebtedness as indicated by such factors, among others, as

(i) a failure by such public or private borrowers to make full interest payments on external indebtedness;

(ii) a failure to comply with the terms of any restructured indebtedness; or

(iii) a failure by the foreign country to comply with any International Monetary Fund or other suitable adjustment program; or

(B) no definite prospects exist for the orderly restoration of debt service.

(2) Such reserves shall be charged against current income and shall not be considered as part of capital and surplus or allowances for possible loan losses for regulatory, supervisory, or disclosure purposes.
