### CHAPTER 11— FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS
#### § 1441b. Resolution Funding Corporation established
##### (f) Obligations of Funding Corporation

(1) Issuance

The Funding Corporation may issue bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations in an aggregate amount not to exceed $30,000,000,000. No obligation may be issued under this paragraph unless, at the time of issuance, the face amounts (the amount of principal payable at maturity) of noninterest bearing instruments in the Funding Corporation Principal Fund are equal to the aggregate amount of principal on the obligations of the Funding Corporation that will be outstanding following such issuance.

(2) Interest payments

The Funding Corporation shall pay the interest due on such obligations from funds obtained for such interest payments from the following sources:

(A) Earnings on certain assets

Earnings on assets of the Funding Corporation which are not invested in the Funding Corporation Principal Fund shall be used for interest payments on outstanding debt of the Funding Corporation.

(B) Proceeds from Resolution Trust Corporation

To the extent the amounts available pursuant to subparagraph (A) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, the Resolution Trust Corporation shall pay to the Funding Corporation

(i) the liquidating dividends and payments made on claims received by the Resolution Trust Corporation from receiverships to the extent such proceeds are determined by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board to be in excess of funds presently necessary for resolution costs; and

(ii) any proceeds from warrants and participations acquired by the Resolution Trust Corporation.

(C) Payments by Federal home loan banks

(i) In general

To the extent that the amounts available pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, each Federal home loan bank shall pay to the Funding Corporation in each calendar year, 20.0 percent of the net earnings of that Bank (after deducting expenses relating to section 1430(j) of this title and operating expenses).

(ii) Annual determination

The Director annually shall determine the extent to which the value of the aggregate amounts paid by the Federal home loan banks exceeds or falls short of the value of an annuity of $300,000,000 per year that commences on the issuance date and ends on the final scheduled maturity date of the obligations, and shall select appropriate present value factors for making such determinations, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.

(iii) Payment term alterations

The Director shall extend or shorten the term of the payment obligations of a Federal home loan bank under this subparagraph as necessary to ensure that the value of all payments made by the Banks is equivalent to the value of an annuity referred to in clause (ii).

(iv) Term beyond maturity

If the Director extends the term of payment obligations beyond the final scheduled maturity date for the obligations, each Federal home loan bank shall continue to pay 20.0 percent of its net earnings (after deducting expenses relating to section 1430(j) of this title and operating expenses) to the Treasury of the United States until the value of all such payments by the Federal home loan banks is equivalent to the value of an annuity referred to in clause (ii). In the final year in which the Federal home loan banks are required to make any payment to the Treasury under this subparagraph, if the dollar amount represented by 20.0 percent of the net earnings of the Federal home loan banks exceeds the remaining obligation of the Banks to the Treasury, the Director shall reduce the percentage pro rata to a level sufficient to pay the remaining obligation.

(v) Semiannual reports

The Director shall report semiannually to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on the projected date for the completion of contributions required by this section.

(D) Proceeds from sale of assets

To the extent the amounts available pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, the FSLIC Resolution Fund shall transfer to the Funding Corporation any net proceeds from the sale of assets received from the Resolution Trust Corporation, which shall be used by the Funding Corporation to pay such interest.

(E) Treasury backup

(i) In general

To the extent the amounts available pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) are insufficient to cover the amount of interest payments, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the Funding Corporation the additional amount due, which shall be used by the Funding Corporation to pay such interest.

(ii) Liability of Funding Corporation

In each instance where the Secretary is required to make a payment under this subparagraph to the Funding Corporation, the amount of the payment shall become a liability of the Funding Corporation to be repaid to the Secretary upon dissolution of the Funding Corporation (to the extent the Funding Corporation may have any remaining assets).

(iii) Appropriation of funds

There are hereby appropriated to the Secretary, for fiscal year 1989 and each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as may be necessary to carry out clause (i).

On maturity of an obligation issued under this subsection, the obligation shall be repaid by the Funding Corporation from the liquidation of noninterest bearing instruments held in the Funding Corporation Principal Fund.

(A) purchase the capital certificates issued by the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a of this title ; or

(B) refund any previously issued obligation the proceeds of which were transferred in the manner described in subparagraph (A).

(5) Investment of United States funds in obligations

Obligations issued under this section by the Funding Corporation, at the direction of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board shall be lawful investments, and may be accepted as security, for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control of the United States or any officer of the United States.

(6) Market for obligations

All persons having the power to invest in, sell, underwrite, purchase for their own accounts, accept as security, or otherwise deal in obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks shall also have the power to do so with respect to obligations of the Funding Corporation.

(7) Tax exempt status

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), obligations of the Funding Corporation shall be exempt from tax both as to principal and interest to the same extent as any obligation of a Federal Home Loan Bank is exempt from tax under section 1433 of this title .

(B) Exception

The Funding Corporation, like the Federal Home Loan Banks, shall be treated as an agency of the United States for purposes of the first sentence of section 3124(b) of title 31 (relating to determination of tax status of interest on obligations).

(8) Obligations not exempt securities

(A) In general

For purposes of the laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, obligations of the Funding Corporation

(i) shall not be considered to be securities issued or guaranteed by a person controlled or supervised by, or acting as an instrumentality of, the Government of the United States; and

(ii) shall not be considered to be “exempted securities” within the meaning of section 78c(a)(12)(A)(i) of title 15 , except that such obligations shall be considered to be exempted securities for purposes of section 78 o of title 15.

(B) Authority of Commission

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Securities and Exchange Commission may, by rule or order, consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors, exempt securities issued by the Funding Corporation from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 [ 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.

(9) Minority participation in public or negotiated offerings

The Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board and the Directorate shall ensure that minority owned or controlled commercial banks, investment banking firms, underwriters, and bond counsels throughout the United States have an opportunity to participate to a significant degree in any public or negotiated offering of obligations issued under this section.

(10) No full faith and credit of the United States

Obligations of the Funding Corporation shall not be obligations of, or guaranteed as to principal by, the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Federal Home Loan Banks, the United States, or the Resolution Trust Corporation and the obligations shall so plainly state. The Secretary shall pay interest on such obligations as required pursuant to this subsection.
