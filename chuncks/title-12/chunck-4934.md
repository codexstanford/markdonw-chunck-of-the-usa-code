#### § 5466. Examination of and enforcement actions against designated financial market utilities
##### (f) Emergency enforcement actions by the Board of Governors

(1) Imminent risk of substantial harm

The Board of Governors may, after consulting with the Supervisory Agency and upon an affirmative vote by a majority the Council, take enforcement action against a designated financial market utility if the Board of Governors has reasonable cause to conclude that

(A) either

(i) an action engaged in, or contemplated by, a designated financial market utility (including any change proposed by the designated financial market utility to its rules, procedures, or operations that would otherwise be subject to section 5465(e) of this title ) poses an imminent risk of substantial harm to financial institutions, critical markets, or the broader financial system of the United States; or

(ii) the condition of a designated financial market utility poses an imminent risk of substantial harm to financial institutions, critical markets, or the broader financial system; and

(B) the imminent risk of substantial harm precludes the Board of Governors’ use of the procedures in subsection (e).

(2) Enforcement authority

For purposes of taking enforcement action under paragraph (1), a designated financial market utility shall be subject to, and the Board of Governors shall have authority under  2 the provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of section 1818 of this title in the same manner and to the same extent as if the designated financial market utility was an insured depository institution and the Board of Governors was the appropriate Federal banking agency for such insured depository institution.
