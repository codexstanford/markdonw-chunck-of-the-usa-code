### CHAPTER 11— FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS
#### § 1430b. Advances to nonmember mortgagee; terms and conditions
##### (a) In general

Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to make advances to nonmember mortgagees approved under title II of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]. Such mortgagees must be chartered institutions having succession and subject to the inspection and supervision of some governmental agency, and whose principal activity in the mortgage field must consist of lending their own funds. Such advances shall not be subject to the other provisions and restrictions of this chapter, but shall be made upon the security of insured mortgages, insured under title II of the National Housing Act. Advances made under the terms of this section shall be at such rates of interest and upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Director, but no advance may be for an amount in excess of 90 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage loan given as security.
