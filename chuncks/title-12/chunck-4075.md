The Secretary of the Treasury shall seek to fund activities in geographically diverse areas of economic distress, including metropolitan and underserved rural areas in every State.

(v) any other criteria designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.

(3) Leverage of funds

Each grant from the Capital Magnet Fund awarded under this section shall be reasonably expected to result in eligible housing, or economic and community development projects that support or sustain an affordable housing project funded by a grant under this section whose aggregate costs total at least 10 times the grant amount.

(4) Commitment for use deadline

Amounts made available for grants under this section shall be committed for use within 2 years of the date of such allocation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall recapture into the Capital Magnet Fund any amounts not so used or committed for use and allocate such amounts in the first year after such recapture.

(6) Additional lobbying restrictions

No assistance or amounts made available under this section may be expended by an eligible grantee to pay any person to influence or attempt to influence any agency, elected official, officer or employee of a State or local government in connection with the making, award, extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any State or local government contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement as such terms are defined in section 1352 of title 31 .

(7) Prohibition of consideration of use for meeting housing goals or duty to serve

In determining the compliance of the enterprises with the housing goals under this section and the duty to serve underserved markets under section 4565 of this title , the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency may not consider any Capital Magnet Fund amounts used under this section for eligible activities under subsection (f). The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency shall give credit toward the achievement of such housing goals and such duty to serve underserved markets to purchases by the enterprises of mortgages for housing that receives funding from Capital Magnet Fund grant amounts, but only to the extent that such purchases by the enterprises are funded other than with such grant amounts.

(8) Accountability of recipients and grantees

(A) Tracking of funds

The Secretary of the Treasury shall

(ii) establish minimum requirements for agreements, between the grantee and the Capital Magnet Fund, regarding assistance from the Capital Magnet Fund, which shall include

(I) appropriate periodic financial and project reporting, record retention, and audit requirements for the duration of the grant to the recipient to ensure compliance with the limitations and requirements of this section and the regulations under this section; and

(II) any other requirements that the Secretary determines are necessary to ensure appropriate grant administration and compliance.

(B) Misuse of funds

If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that a grantee has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this section and until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply, the Secretary shall

(i) reduce the amount of assistance under this section to the grantee by an amount equal to the amount of Capital Magnet Fund grant amounts which were not used in accordance with this section;
