### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1831q. FDIC affordable housing program
##### (l) Rules governing disposition of eligible condominium property

(1) Notice to clearinghouses

Within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to an eligible condominium property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to clearinghouses. Such notice shall contain basic information about the property. Each clearinghouse shall make such information available, upon request, to purchasers described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (2). The Corporation shall allow such purchasers reasonable access to an eligible condominium property for purposes of inspection.

(2) Offers to sell

For the 180-day period following the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible condominium property available for sale, the Corporation may offer to sell the property, at the discretion of the Corporation, to 1 or more of the following purchasers:

(A) Qualifying households.

(B) Nonprofit organizations.

(C) Public agencies.

(D) For-profit entities.

(3) Low-income occupancy requirements

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any nonprofit organization, public agency, or for-profit entity that purchases an eligible condominium property shall (i) make the property available for occupancy by and maintain it as affordable for low-income families for the remaining useful life of the property, or (ii) make the property available for purchase by any such family who, except as provided in paragraph (5), agrees to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months and certifies in writing that the family intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months. The restriction described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument.

(B) Multiple-unit purchases

If any nonprofit organization, public agency, or for-profit entity purchases more than 1 eligible condominium property as a part of the same negotiation or purchase, the Corporation may (in the discretion of the Corporation) waive the requirement under subparagraph (A) and provide instead that not less than 35 percent of all eligible condominium properties purchased shall be (i) made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income families for the remaining useful life of the property, or (ii) made available for purchase by any such family who, except as provided in paragraph (5), agrees to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months and certifies in writing that the family intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months. The restriction described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument.

(C) Sale to other purchasers

If, upon the expiration of the 180-day period referred to in paragraph (2), no purchaser described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (2) has made a bona fide offer to purchase the property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property to any other purchaser.

(4) Recapture of profits from resale

Except as provided in paragraph (5), if any eligible condominium property sold (A) to a qualifying household, or (B) to a low-income family pursuant to paragraph (3)(A)(ii) or (3)(B)(ii), is resold by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or family, the Corporation shall recapture 75 percent of the amount of any proceeds from the resale that exceed the sum of (i) the original sale price for the acquisition of the property by the qualifying household or low-income family, (ii) the costs of any improvements to the property made after the date of the acquisition, and (iii) any closing costs in connection with the acquisition.

(5) Exception to recapture requirement

The Corporation (or its successor) may in its discretion waive the applicability to any qualifying household or low-income family of the requirement under paragraph (4) and the requirements relating to residency of a qualifying household or low-income family (under subsection (p)(12) and paragraph (3) of this subsection, respectively). The Corporation may grant any such a waiver only for good cause shown, including any necessary relocation of the qualifying household or low-income family.

(6) Limitations on multiple unit purchases

The Corporation may not sell or offer to sell as part of the same negotiation or purchase any eligible condominium properties that are not located in the same condominium project (as such term is defined in section 3603 of title 15 ). The preceding sentence may not be construed to require all eligible condominium properties offered or sold as part of the same negotiation or purchase to be located in the same structure.

(7) Rent limitations

Rents charged to tenants of eligible condominium properties made available for occupancy by very low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary, with adjustment for family size. Rents charged to tenants of eligible condominium properties made available for occupancy by low-income families other than very low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 65 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary, with adjustment for family size.
