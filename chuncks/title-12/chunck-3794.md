### CHAPTER 42— LOW-INCOME HOUSING PRESERVATION AND RESIDENT HOMEOWNERSHIP
#### § 4145. Delivery of assistance through intermediaries
##### (b) Selection of eligible intermediaries

(1) In general

The Secretary shall develop criteria to select eligible intermediaries, through a competitive process, to administer assistance under this subchapter. The process shall include provision for a reasonable administrative fee.

(2) Priority

With respect to all forms of grants available under section 4143 of this title , such criteria shall give priority to applications from eligible intermediaries with demonstrated expertise or experience with the program established under this title  1 or under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987.

(3) Criteria

The criteria developed under this subsection shall

(A) not assign any preference or priority to applications from eligible intermediaries based on their previous participation in administering or receiving Federal grants or loans (but may exclude applicants who have failed to perform under prior contracts of a similar nature);

(B) require an applicant to prepare a proposal that demonstrates adequate staffing, qualifications, prior experience, and a plan for participation; and

(C) permit an applicant to serve as the administrator of assistance made available under section 4143(d) or (e) of this title, based on the applicant’s suitability and interest.

(4) Geographic coverage

The Secretary may select more than 1 State or regional intermediary for a single State or region. The number of intermediaries chosen for each State or region may be based on the number of eligible low-income housing projects in the State or region, provided there is no duplication of geographic coverage by intermediaries in the administration of the direct assistance grant program.

(5) National nonprofit intermediaries

National nonprofit intermediaries shall be selected to administer the assistance made available under section 4143 of this title only with respect to States or regions for which no other eligible intermediary, acceptable to the Secretary, has submitted a proposal to participate.

(6) Preference

With respect to assistance made available under section 4144 of this title , preference shall be given to eligible regional, State, and local intermediaries, over national nonprofit organizations.
