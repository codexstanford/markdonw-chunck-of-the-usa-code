### CHAPTER 52— EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION
#### § 5223. Minimization of long-term costs and maximization of benefits for taxpayers
##### (a) Long-term costs and benefits

(1) Minimizing negative impact

The Secretary shall use the authority under this chapter in a manner that will minimize any potential long-term negative impact on the taxpayer, taking into account the direct outlays, potential long-term returns on assets purchased, and the overall economic benefits of the program, including economic benefits due to improvements in economic activity and the availability of credit, the impact on the savings and pensions of individuals, and reductions in losses to the Federal Government.

(2) Authority

In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) hold the assets to maturity or for resale for and until such time as the Secretary determines that the market is optimal for selling such assets, in order to maximize the value for taxpayers; and

(B) sell such assets at a price that the Secretary determines, based on available financial analysis, will maximize return on investment for the Federal Government.

(3) Private sector participation

The Secretary shall encourage the private sector to participate in purchases of troubled assets, and to invest in financial institutions, consistent with the provisions of this section.
