(B) Exception

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board may continue to take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate in lieu of appointment of a liquidating agent if

(II) the insured credit union has positive net income or has an upward trend in earnings that the Board projects as sustainable; and
