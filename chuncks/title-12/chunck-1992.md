(B) If such approval has not been received by the Board within 30 days of receipt of notice by the State that the Board has determined such grounds exist, and the Board has responded in writing to the State’s written reasons, if any, for withholding approval, then the Board may proceed without State approval only by a unanimous vote of the Board.

Except as provided in this paragraph, no court may take any action, except at the request of the Board by regulation or order, to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the Board as conservator.

(4) Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of a Federal credit union, the Board may maintain possession and control of the business and assets of such credit union and may operate such credit union until such time

(C) as such credit union is liquidated in accordance with the provisions of section 1787 of this title .

(6) The Board may appoint such agents as it considers necessary in order to assist the Board in carrying out its duties as a conservator under this subsection.
