(C) Manner of payment

The Corporation may make payments or credit amounts under subparagraph (A) directly to the claimants or may make such payments or credit such amounts to a company other than a covered financial company or a bridge financial company established with respect thereto in order to induce such other company to accept liability for such claims.
