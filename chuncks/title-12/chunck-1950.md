#### § 1781. Insurance of member accounts
##### (c) Approval of application

(1) Before approving the application of any credit union for insurance of its member accounts, the Board shall consider

(A) the history, financial condition, and management policies of the applicant;

(B) the economic advisability of insuring the applicant without undue risk of the fund;

(C) the general character and fitness of the applicant’s management;

(D) the convenience and needs of the members to be served by the applicant; and

(E) whether the applicant is a cooperative association organized for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes.

(2) The Board shall disapprove the application of any credit union for insurance of its member accounts if it finds that its reserves are inadequate, that its financial condition and policies are unsafe or unsound, that its management is unfit, that insurance of its member accounts would otherwise involve undue risk to the fund, or that its powers and purposes are inconsistent with the promotion of thrift among its members and the creation of a source of credit for provident or productive purposes.
