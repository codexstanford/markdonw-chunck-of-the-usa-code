### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1715z–17. Shared appreciation mortgages for single family housing
##### (b) Payment of mortgagee’s share of net appreciated value; “net appreciated value” defined

The mortgagee’s share of a property’s or stock’s net appreciated value shall be payable upon sale or transfer (as defined by the Secretary) of the property or stock or payment in full of the mortgage, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this section, the term “net appreciated value” means the amount by which the sales price of the property or stock (less the mortgagor’s selling costs) exceeds the value of the property or stock at the time the commitment to insure is issued (with adjustments for capital improvements stipulated in the loan contract). If there has been no sale or transfer at the time the mortgagee’s share of net appreciated value becomes payable, the sales price for purposes of this section shall be determined by means of an appraisal conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Secretary and provided for in the mortgage.
