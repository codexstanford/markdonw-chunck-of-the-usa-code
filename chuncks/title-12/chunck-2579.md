### CHAPTER 17— BANK HOLDING COMPANIES
#### § 1843. Interests in nonbanking organizations
##### (m) Provisions applicable to financial holding companies that fail to meet certain requirements

(1) In general

If the Board finds that

(A) a financial holding company is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any activity under subsection (k), (n), or ( o ), other than activities that are permissible for a bank holding company under subsection (c)(8); and

(B) such financial holding company is not in compliance with the requirements of subsection ( l )(1); the Board shall give notice to the financial holding company to that effect, describing the conditions giving rise to the notice.

(2) Agreement to correct conditions required

Not later than 45 days after the date of receipt by a financial holding company of a notice given under paragraph (1) (or such additional period as the Board may permit), the financial holding company shall execute an agreement with the Board to comply with the requirements applicable to a financial holding company under subsection ( l )(1).

(3) Board may impose limitations

Until the conditions described in a notice to a financial holding company under paragraph (1) are corrected, the Board may impose such limitations on the conduct or activities of that financial holding company or any affiliate of that company as the Board determines to be appropriate under the circumstances and consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

(4) Failure to correct

If the conditions described in a notice to a financial holding company under paragraph (1) are not corrected within 180 days after the date of receipt by the financial holding company of a notice under paragraph (1), the Board may require such financial holding company, under such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Board and subject to such extension of time as may be granted in the discretion of the Board, either

(A) to divest control of any subsidiary depository institution; or

(B) at the election of the financial holding company instead to cease to engage in any activity conducted by such financial holding company or its subsidiaries (other than a depository institution or a subsidiary of a depository institution) that is not an activity that is permissible for a bank holding company under subsection (c)(8).

(5) Consultation

In taking any action under this subsection, the Board shall consult with all relevant Federal and State regulatory agencies and authorities.
