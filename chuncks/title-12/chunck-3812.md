##### (d) Share of funds and assets

(1) When the United States acquires funds or assets pursuant to the execution of a judgment, order, or settlement and the Attorney General determines that the judgment, order, or settlement was based in whole or in part on the information contained in a valid declaration filed under section 4201 of this title , the declarant shall have the right to share in the recovery as follows:

(A)

(i) The declarant shall be entitled to 20 percent to 30 percent of any recovery up to the first $1,000,000 recovered, 10 percent to 20 percent of the next $4,000,000 recovered, and 5 percent to 10 percent of the next $5,000,000 recovered.

(ii) In calculating an award under clause (i), the Attorney General may consider the size of the overall recovery and the usefulness of the information provided by the declarant.

(B) When a declarant has received an award under subsection (c), the Attorney General may subtract the amount of that reward from any recovery under this subsection.

(2)

(A) When more than 1 declarant has provided information leading to a recovery under this subsection, the Attorney General shall first calculate the size of the total award under paragraph (1)(A) and then distribute that amount according to the contribution made by each declarant.

(B) In distributing any such award between 2 or more declarants, the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General’s discretion, consider any appropriate factor.
