### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1831u. Interstate bank mergers
##### (d) Operations of the resulting bank

(1) Continued operations

A resulting bank may, subject to the approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency, retain and operate, as a main office or a branch, any office that any bank involved in an interstate merger transaction was operating as a main office or a branch immediately before the merger transaction.

(2) Additional branches

Following the consummation of any interstate merger transaction, the resulting bank may establish, acquire, or operate additional branches at any location where any bank involved in the transaction could have established, acquired, or operated a branch under applicable Federal or State law if such bank had not been a party to the merger transaction.

(3) Certain conditions and commitments continued

If, as a condition for the acquisition of a bank by an out-of-State bank holding company before September 29, 1994

(A) the home State of the acquired bank imposed conditions on such acquisition by such out-of-State bank holding company; or

(B) the bank holding company made commitments to such State in connection with the acquisition, the State may enforce such conditions and commitments with respect to such bank holding company or any affiliated successor company which controls a bank or branch in such State as a result of an interstate merger transaction to the same extent as the State could enforce such conditions or commitments against the bank holding company before the consummation of the merger transaction.
