### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1715z–6. Supplemental loans for multifamily projects
##### (e) Loan insurance for energy conserving improvements and solar energy systems

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may insure a loan for purchasing and installing energy conserving improvements (as defined in subparagraph (2) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title ), for purchasing and installing a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title ), and for purchasing or installing (or both) individual utility meters in a multifamily housing project if such meters are purchased or installed in connection with other energy conserving improvements or with a solar energy system or the project meets minimum standards of energy conservation established by the Secretary, without regard to whether the proj­ect is covered by a mortgage under this chapter.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), a loan insured under this subsection shall

(A) not exceed an amount which the Secretary determines is necessary for the purchase and installation of individual utility meters plus an amount which the Secretary deems appropriate taking into account amounts which will be saved in operation costs over the period of repayment of the loan by reducing the energy requirements of the project as a result of the installation of energy conserving improvements or a solar energy system therein;

(B) be insured for 90 percent of any loss incurred by the person holding the note for the loan; except that, for cooperative multifamily projects receiving assistance under section 1715z–1 of this title or financed with a below market interest rate mortgage insured under section 1715 l (d)(3) of this title, 100 percent of any such loss may be insured;

(C) bear an interest rate not to exceed an amount which the Secretary determines, after consulting with the Secretary of Energy, to be necessary to meet market demands;

(D) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary;

(E) be insured pursuant to a premium rate established on a sound actuarial basis to the extent practicable;

(F) be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;

(G) be an acceptable risk in that energy conservation or solar energy benefits to be derived outweigh the risks of possible loss to the Federal Government; and

(H) contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(3) The provisions of subsection (c) shall apply to loans insured under this subsection.

(4) The Secretary shall provide that any person obligated on the note for any loan insured under this section be regulated or restricted, until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance, by the Secretary as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operations of the multifamily project to such an extent and in such manner as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment.
