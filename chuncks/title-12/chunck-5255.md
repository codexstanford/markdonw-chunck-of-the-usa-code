### CHAPTER 55— ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE (LIBOR)
#### § 5805. Benchmark for loans
##### (b) Benchmarks used by banks

With respect to a benchmark used by a bank

(1) the bank, in any non-IBOR loan made before, on, or after March 15, 2022 , may use any benchmark, including a benchmark that is not SOFR, that the bank determines to be appropriate for the funding model of the bank; the needs of the customers of the bank; and the products, risk profile, risk management capabilities, and operational capabilities of the bank; provided, however, that the use of any benchmark shall remain subject to the terms of the non-IBOR loan, and applicable law; and

(2) no Federal supervisory agency may take any covered action against the bank solely because that benchmark is not SOFR.
