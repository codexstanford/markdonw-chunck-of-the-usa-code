(3) Limitation

(A) Least-cost resolution

Assistance may not be provided to an insured System bank under this subsection unless the means of providing the assistance is the least costly means of providing the assistance by the Farm Credit Insurance Fund of all possible alternatives available to the Corporation, including liquidation of the bank (including paying the insured obligations issued on behalf of the bank). Before making a least-cost determination under this subparagraph, the Corporation shall accord such other insured System banks as the Corporation determines to be appropriate the opportunity to submit information relating to the determination.

Any determination that the Corporation makes under this paragraph shall be in the sole discretion of the Corporation.

(F) Purchase of stock

Any assistance provided under this subsection may be in subordination to the rights of owners of obligations and other creditors.
