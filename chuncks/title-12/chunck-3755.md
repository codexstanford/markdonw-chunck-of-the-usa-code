The Secretary shall coordinate with public housing agencies to ensure that any very low- or low-income family displaced from eligible low-income housing as the result of the prepayment of the mortgage (or termination of the mortgage insurance contract) on such housing is able to acquire a suitable, affordable dwelling unit in the area of the housing from which the family is displaced. The Secretary shall require the owner of such housing to pay 50 percent of the moving expenses of each family relocated, except that such percentage shall be increased to the extent that State or local law of general applicability requires a higher payment by the owner.
