(A) acquire the eligible low-income housing from the current owner for a purchase price not greater than the preservation equity of the housing;

(B) pay the debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage covering the housing;

(C) pay the debt service on any loan for the rehabilitation of the housing;

(D) meet project operating expenses and establish adequate reserves for the housing, and in the case of a priority purchaser, meet project oversight costs;

(E) receive a distribution equal to an 8 percent annual return on any actual cash investment (from sources other than assistance provided under this title  2 ) made to acquire or rehabilitate the project;

(F) in the case of a priority purchaser, receive a reimbursement of all reasonable transaction expenses associated with the acquisition, loan closing, and implementation of an approved plan of action; and

(G) in the case of an approved resident homeownership program, cover the costs of training for the resident council, homeownership counseling and training, the fees for the nonprofit entity or public agency working with the resident council and costs related to relocation of tenants who elect to move.

(3) Incentives

(A) In general

For all qualified purchasers of housing under this subsection, the Secretary may provide assistance for an approved plan of action in the form of 1 or more of the incentives authorized under section 4109(b) of this title , except that the incentive under such section 4109(b)(7) of this title may include an acquisition loan under section 1715z–6(f)  2 of this title.

(B) Priority purchasers

Where the qualified purchaser is a priority purchaser, the Secretary may provide assistance for an approved plan of action (in the form of a grant) for each unit in the housing in an amount, as determined by the Secretary, that does not exceed the present value of the total of the projected published fair market rentals for existing housing (established by the Secretary under section 1437f(c) of title 42 ) for the next 10 years (or such longer period if additional assistance is necessary to cover the costs referred to in paragraph (2)).
