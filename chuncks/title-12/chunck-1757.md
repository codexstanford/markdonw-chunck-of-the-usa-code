The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.

(2) Preference or priority of opportunity in the occupancy of the mortgaged property for veterans of World War II and their immediate families, and for hardship cases as defined by the Secretary, shall be provided under such regulations and procedures as may be prescribed by the Secretary.

(3) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount

(A) not to exceed $5,000,000; and

(C) not to exceed $8,100 per family unit for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use. The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payment within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4½ per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release.
