##### (a) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund

(1) Establishment

Subject to the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [ 2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], there is hereby created a Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (in this subchapter referred to as the “Fund”), which shall be used by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter with respect to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title . The Secretary may enter into commitments to guarantee, and may guarantee, such insured mortgages.

(2) Limit on loan guarantees

The authority of the Secretary to enter into commitments to guarantee such insured mortgages shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent that the aggregate original principal loan amount under such mortgages, any part of which is guaranteed, does not exceed the amount specified in appropriations Acts for such fiscal year.

(3) Fiduciary responsibility

The Secretary has a responsibility to ensure that the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund remains financially sound.

(4) Annual independent actuarial study

The Secretary shall provide for an independent actuarial study of the Fund to be conducted annually, which shall analyze the financial position of the Fund. The Secretary shall submit a report annually to the Congress describing the results of such study and assessing the financial status of the Fund. The report shall recommend adjustments to underwriting standards, program participation, or premiums, if necessary, to ensure that the Fund remains financially sound. The report shall also include an evaluation of the quality control procedures and accuracy of information utilized in the process of underwriting loans guaranteed by the Fund. Such evaluation shall include a review of the risk characteristics of loans based not only on borrower information and performance, but on risks associated with loans originated or funded by various entities or financial institutions.

(5) Quarterly reports

During each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress for each calendar quarter, which shall specify for mortgages that are obligations of the Fund

(A) the cumulative volume of loan guarantee commitments that have been made during such fiscal year through the end of the quarter for which the report is submitted;

(B) the types of loans insured, categorized by risk;

(C) any significant changes between actual and projected claim and prepayment activity;

(D) projected versus actual loss rates; and

(E) updated projections of the annual subsidy rates to ensure that increases in risk to the Fund are identified and mitigated by adjustments to underwriting standards, program participation, or premiums, and the financial soundness of the Fund is maintained. The first quarterly report under this paragraph shall be submitted on the last day of the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, or on the last day of the first full calendar quarter following July 30, 2008 , whichever is later.

(6) Adjustment of premiums

If, pursuant to the independent actuarial study of the Fund required under paragraph (4), the Secretary determines that the Fund is not meeting the operational goals established under paragraph (7) or there is a substantial probability that the Fund will not maintain its established target subsidy rate, the Secretary may either make programmatic adjustments under this subchapter as necessary to reduce the risk to the Fund, or make appropriate premium adjustments.

(7) Operational goals

The operational goals for the Fund are

(A) to minimize the default risk to the Fund and to homeowners by among other actions instituting fraud prevention quality control screening not later than 18 months after July 30, 2008 ; and

(B) to meet the housing needs of the borrowers that the single family mortgage insurance program under this subchapter is designed to serve.
