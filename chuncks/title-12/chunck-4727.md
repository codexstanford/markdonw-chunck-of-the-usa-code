The data standards established in the final rules promulgated under subsection (b)(2) shall

(iv) be nonproprietary or made available under an open license;

(v) incorporate standards developed and maintained by voluntary consensus standards bodies; and

(vi) use, be consistent with, and implement applicable accounting and reporting principles.
