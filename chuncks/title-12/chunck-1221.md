### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1709. Insurance of mortgages
##### (r) Actions to reduce losses under single family mortgage insurance program

The Secretary shall take appropriate actions to reduce losses under the single-family mortgage insurance programs carried out under this subchapter. Such actions shall include

(1) an annual review by the Secretary of the rate of early serious defaults and claims, in accordance with section 1735f–11 of this title ;

(2) requiring that at least one person acquiring ownership of a one- to four-family residential property encumbered by a mortgage insured under this subchapter be determined to be creditworthy under standards prescribed by the Secretary, whether or not such person assumes personal liability under the mortgage (except that acquisitions by devise or descent shall not be subject to this requirement);

(3) in any case where personal liability under a mortgage is assumed, requiring that the original mortgagor be advised of the procedures by which he or she may be released from liability; and

(4) providing counseling, either directly or through third parties, to delinquent mortgagors whose mortgages are insured under this section, using the Fund to pay for such counseling. In any case where the homeowner does not request a release from liability, the purchaser and the homeowner shall have joint and several liability for any default for a period of 5 years following the date of the assumption. After the close of such 5-year period, only the purchaser shall be liable for any default on the mortgage unless the mortgage is in default at the time of the expiration of the 5-year period.
