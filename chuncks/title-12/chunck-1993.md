(A) In general .

Whenever any institution-affiliated party is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint, with the commission of or participation in

(i) a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under State or Federal law, or

(ii) a criminal violation of section 1956, 1957, or 1960 of title 18 or section 5322 or 5324 of title 31, the Board may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the interests of the credit union’s members or may threaten to impair public confidence in any credit union, by written notice served upon such party, suspend such party from office or prohibit such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any credit union.

(B) Provisions applicable to notice.

(i) Copy .

A copy of any notice under subparagraph (A) shall also be served upon the credit union of which the subject of the order is, or most recently was, an institution-affiliated party.

(ii) Effective period .

A suspension or prohibition under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint referred to in such subparagraph is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Board.

(C) Removal or prohibition.

(i) In general .

If a judgment of conviction or an agreement to enter a pretrial diversion or other similar program is entered against an institution-affiliated party in connection with a crime described in subparagraph (A)(i), at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Board may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the interests of any credit union’s members or may threaten to impair public confidence in any credit union, issue and serve upon such party an order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any credit union without the prior written consent of the Board.

(ii) Required for certain offenses

In the case of a judgment of conviction or agreement against an institution-affiliated party in connection with a violation described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the Board shall issue and serve upon such party an order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any credit union without the prior written consent of the Board.

(D) Provisions applicable to order.

(i) Copy .

A copy of any order under subparagraph (C) shall also be served upon the credit union of which the subject of the order is, or most recently was, an institution-affiliated party, whereupon such party (if a director or an officer) shall cease to be a director or officer of such credit union.

(ii) Effect of acquittal .

A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Board from instituting proceedings after such finding or disposition to remove such party from office or to prohibit further participation in credit union affairs, pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (g) of this section.

(iii) Effective period .

Any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under this paragraph shall remain effective and outstanding until the completion of any hearing or appeal authorized under paragraph (3) unless terminated by the Board.

(E) Continuation of authority .

The Board may issue an order under this paragraph with respect to an individual who is an institution-affiliated party at a credit union at the time of an offense described in subparagraph (A) without regard to

(i) whether such individual is an institution-affiliated party at any credit union at the time the order is considered or issued by the Board; or

(ii) whether the credit union at which the individual was an institution-affiliated party at the time of the offense remains in existence at the time the order is considered or issued by the Board.

(2) If at any time, because of the suspension of one or more directors pursuant to this section, there shall be on the board of directors of a Federal credit union less than a quorum of directors not so suspended, all powers and functions vested in or exercisable by such board shall vest in and be exercisable by the director or directors on the board not so suspended, until such time as there shall be a quorum of the board of directors. In the event all of the directors of a Federal credit union are suspended pursuant to this section, the Board shall appoint persons to serve temporarily as directors in their place and stead pending the termination of such suspensions, or until such time as those who have been suspended cease to be directors of the credit union and their respective successors have been elected by the members at an annual or special meeting and have taken office. Directors appointed temporarily by the Board shall, within thirty days following their appointment, call a special meeting for the election of new directors, unless during the thirty-day period (A) the regular annual meeting is scheduled, or (B) the suspensions giving rise to the appointment of temporary directors are terminated.

(3) Within thirty days from service of any notice of suspension or order of removal issued pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the institution-affiliated party concerned may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the Board to show that the continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union by such party does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interests of the credit union’s members or threaten to impair public confidence in the credit union. Upon receipt of any such request, the Board shall fix a time (not more than thirty days after receipt of such request, unless extended at the request of such party) and place at which such party may appear, personally or through counsel, before the Board or its designee to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Board, oral testimony) and oral argument. Within sixty days of such hearing, the Board shall notify such party whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union will be continued, terminated or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification shall contain a statement of the basis for the Board’s decision, if adverse to such party. The Board is authorized to prescribe such rules as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.
