### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1831q. FDIC affordable housing program
##### (d) Rules governing disposition of eligible multifamily housing properties

(1) Notice to clearinghouses

Within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to an eligible multifamily housing property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to clearinghouses. Such notice shall contain basic information about the property, including but not limited to location, number of units (identified by number of bedrooms), and information relating to the estimated fair market value of the property. Each clearinghouse shall make such information available, upon request, to qualifying multifamily purchasers. The Corporation shall allow qualifying multifamily purchasers reasonable access to eligible multifamily housing properties for purposes of inspection.

(2) Expression of serious interest

Qualifying multifamily purchasers may give written notice of serious interest in a property during a period ending 90 days after the time the Corporation provides notice under paragraph (1). The notice of serious interest shall be in such form and include such information as the Corporation may prescribe.

(3) Notice of readiness for sale

Upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2) for a property, the Corporation shall provide written notice to any qualifying multifamily purchaser that has expressed serious interest in the property. Such notice shall specify the minimum terms and conditions for sale of the property.

(4) Offers by qualifying multifamily purchasers

A qualifying multifamily purchaser receiving notice in accordance with paragraph (3) shall have 45 days (from the date notice is received) to make a bona fide offer to purchase the property. The Corporation shall accept an offer that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation. If, before the expiration of such 45-day period, any offer to purchase a property initially accepted by the Corporation is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the Corporation shall accept another offer to purchase the property made during such period that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation (if such another offer is made). The preceding sentence may not be construed to require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose offer is accepted during the 45-day period to purchase the property before the expiration of the period.

(5) Extension of restricted offer periods

The Corporation may provide notice to clearinghouses regarding, and offer for sale under the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4), any eligible multifamily housing property

(A) in which no qualifying multifamily purchaser has expressed serious interest during the period referred to in paragraph (2), or

(B) for which no qualifying multifamily purchaser has made a bona fide offer before the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (4), except that the Corporation may, in the discretion of the Corporation, alter the duration of the periods referred to in paragraphs (2) and (4) in offering any property for sale under this paragraph.

(6) Sale of multifamily properties to other purchasers

(A) Timing

If, upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (2), no qualifying multifamily purchaser has expressed serious interest in a property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property, individually or in combination with other properties, to any purchaser.

(B) Limitation on combination sales

The Corporation may not sell in combination with other properties any property for which a qualifying multifamily purchaser has expressed serious interest in purchasing individually.

(C) Expiration of offer period

If, upon the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (4), no qualifying multifamily purchaser has made an offer to purchase a property, the Corporation may offer to sell the property, individually or in combination with other properties, to any purchaser.

(7) Low-income occupancy requirements

(A) Single property purchases

With respect to any purchase of a single eligible multifamily housing property by a qualifying multifamily purchaser under paragraph (4) or (5)

(i) not less than 35 percent of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income and very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the property in which the units are located; provided that

(ii) not less than 20 percent of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the property in which the units are located.

(B) Aggregation requirements for multiproperty purchases

With respect to any purchase under paragraph (4) or (5) by a qualifying multifamily purchaser involving more than one eligible multifamily housing property as a part of the same negotiation, with respect to which the purchaser intends to aggregate the low-income occupancy required under this paragraph over the total number of units so purchased

(i) not less than 40 percent of the aggregate number of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income and very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the building or structure in which the units are located; provided that

(ii) not less than 20 percent of the aggregate number of all dwelling units purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for very low-income families during the remaining useful life of the building or structure in which the units are located; and further provided that

(iii) not less than 10 percent of the dwelling units in each separate property purchased shall be made available for occupancy by and maintained as affordable for low-income families during the remaining useful life of the property in which the units are located. The requirements of this paragraph shall be contained in the deed or other recorded instrument.

(8) Exemptions

(A) Continued occupancy of current residents

No purchaser of an eligible multifamily property may terminate the occupancy of any person residing in the property on the date of purchase for purposes of meeting the low-income occupancy requirement applicable to the property under paragraph (7). The purchaser shall be considered to be in compliance with this subsection if each newly vacant dwelling unit is reserved for low-income occupancy until the low-income occupancy requirement is met.

(B) Financial infeasibility

The Secretary or the State housing finance agency for the State in which an eligible multifamily housing property is located may temporarily reduce the low-income occupancy requirements under paragraph (7) applicable to the property, if the Secretary or such agency determines that an owner’s compliance with such requirements is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return low-income occupancy to the level required under paragraph (7), and the Secretary or the State housing finance agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist.
