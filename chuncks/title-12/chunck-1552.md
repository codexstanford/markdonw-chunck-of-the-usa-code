#### § 1715z–22. Multifamily mortgage credit programs
##### (b) Risk-sharing program

(1) In general

The Secretary shall carry out a program in conjunction with qualified participating entities to provide Federal credit enhancement for loans for affordable multifamily housing through a system of risk-sharing agreements with such entities.

(2) Program requirements

(A) In general

In carrying out the program under this subsection, the Secretary shall enter into risk-sharing agreements with qualified participating entities.

(B) Mortgage insurance and reinsurance

Agreements under subparagraph (A) may provide for (i) mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration of loans for affordable multifamily housing originated by or through, or purchased by, qualified participating entities, and (ii) reinsurance, including reinsurance of pools of loans, on affordable multifamily housing. In entering into risk-sharing agreements under this subsection covering mortgages, the Secretary may give preference to mortgages that are not already in the portfolios of qualified participating entities.

(C) Risk apportionment

Agreements entered into under this subsection between the Secretary and a qualified participating entity shall specify the percentage of loss that each of the parties to the agreement will assume in the event of default of the insured or reinsured multifamily mortgage. Such agreements shall specify that the qualified participating entity and the Secretary shall share any loss in accordance with the risk-sharing agreement.

(D) Reimbursement capacity

Agreements entered into under this subsection between the Secretary and a qualified participating entity shall provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary of the capacity of such entity to fulfill any reimbursement obligations made pursuant to this subsection. Evidence of such capacity which may be considered by the Secretary may include

(i) a pledge of the full faith and credit of a qualified participating entity to fulfill any obligations entered into by the entity;

(ii) reserves pledged or otherwise restricted by the qualified participating entity in an amount equal to an agreed upon percentage of the loss assumed by the entity under subparagraph (C);

(iii) funds pledged through a State or local guarantee fund; or

(iv) any other form of evidence mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the qualified participating entity.

(E) Underwriting standards

The Secretary shall allow any qualified participating entity to use its own underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions for purposes of underwriting loans to be insured under this subsection, except as provided in this section, without further review by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may impose additional underwriting criteria and loan terms and conditions for contractual agreements where the Secretary retains more than 50 percent of the risk of loss. Any financing permitted on property insured under this subsection other than the first mortgage shall be expressly subordinate to the insured mortgage.

(F) Authority of Secretary

The Secretary, upon request of a qualified participating entity, may insure or reinsure and make commitments to insure or reinsure under this section any mortgage, advance, loan, or pool of mortgages otherwise eligible under this section, pursuant to a risk-sharing agreement providing that the qualified participating entity will carry out (under a delegation or otherwise, and with or without compensation, but subject to audit, exception, or review requirements) such credit approval, appraisal, inspection, issuance of commitments, approval of insurance of advances, cost certification, servicing, property disposition, or other functions as the Secretary shall approve as consistent with the purpose of this section. All appraisals of property for mortgage insurance under this section shall be completed by a Certified General Appraiser in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.

(G) Disclosure of records

Qualified participating entities shall make available to the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee, at the Secretary’s request, such financial and other records as the Secretary deems necessary for purposes of review and monitoring for the program under this section.

(3) Development of alternatives

The Secretary shall develop and assess a variety of risk-sharing alternatives, including arrangements under which the Secretary assumes an appropriate share of the risk related to long-term mortgage loans on newly constructed or acquired multifamily rental housing, mortgage refinancings, bridge financing for construction, and other forms of multifamily housing mortgage lending that the Secretary deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection. Such alternatives shall be designed

(A) to ensure that other parties bear a share of the risk, in percentage amount and in position of exposure, that is sufficient to create strong, market-oriented incentives for other participating parties to maintain sound underwriting and loan management practices;

(B) to develop credit mechanisms, including sound underwriting criteria, processing methods, and credit enhancements, through which resources of the Federal Housing Administration can assist in increasing multifamily housing lending as needed to meet the expected need in the United States;

(C) to provide a more adequate supply of mortgage credit for sound multifamily rental housing projects in underserved urban and rural markets;

(D) to encourage major financial institutions to expand their participation in mortgage lending for sound multifamily housing, through means such as mitigating uncertainties regarding actions of the Federal Government (including the possible failure to renew short-term subsidy contracts);

(E) to increase the efficiency, and lower the costs to the Federal Government, of processing and servicing multifamily housing mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration; and

(F) to improve the quality and expertise of Federal Housing Administration staff and other resources, as required for sound management of reinsurance and other market-oriented forms of credit enhancement.

(4) Eligibility standards

The Secretary shall establish and enforce standards for eligibility under this subsection of qualified participating entities under this subsection, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(5) Insurance authority

Using any authority provided in appropriation Acts to insure mortgages under the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], the Secretary may enter into commitments under this subsection for risk-sharing units.

(6) Fees

The Secretary shall establish and collect premiums and fees under this subsection as the Secretary determines appropriate to (A) achieve the purpose of this subsection, and (B) compensate the Federal Housing Administration for the risks assumed and related administrative costs.

(7) Non-Federal participation

The Secretary shall carry out this subsection, to the maximum extent practicable, with the participation of well-established residential mortgage originators, financial institutions that invest in multifamily housing mortgages, multifamily housing sponsors, and such other private sector experts in multifamily housing finance as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(8) Prohibition on Ginnie Mae securitization

The Government National Mortgage Association shall not securitize any multifamily loans insured or reinsured under this subsection.

(9) Qualification as affordable housing

Multifamily housing securing loans insured or reinsured under this subsection shall qualify as affordable only if the housing is occupied by families and bears rents not greater than the gross rent for rent-restricted residential units as determined under section 42(g) of title 26 .

(10) Certification of subsidy layering compliance

The requirements of section 3545(d) of title 42 may be satisfied in connection with a commitment to insure a mortgage under this subsection by a certification by a housing credit agency (including an entity established by a State that provides mortgage insurance) to the Secretary that the combination of assistance within the jurisdiction of the Secretary and other government assistance provided in connection with a property for which a mortgage is to be insured shall not be any greater than is necessary to provide affordable housing.

(11) Implementation

The Secretary shall take any administrative actions necessary to initiate the program under this subsection.
