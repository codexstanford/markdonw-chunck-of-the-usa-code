### CHAPTER 53— WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
#### § 5384. Orderly liquidation of covered financial companies
##### (a) Purpose of orderly liquidation authority

It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide the necessary authority to liquidate failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a manner that mitigates such risk and minimizes moral hazard. The authority provided in this subchapter shall be exercised in the manner that best fulfills such purpose, so that

(1) creditors and shareholders will bear the losses of the financial company;

(2) management responsible for the condition of the financial company will not be retained; and

(3) the Corporation and other appropriate agencies will take all steps necessary and appropriate to assure that all parties, including management, directors, and third parties, having responsibility for the condition of the financial company bear losses consistent with their responsibility, including actions for damages, restitution, and recoupment of compensation and other gains not compatible with such responsibility.
