#### § 4114. Permissible prepayment or voluntary termination and modification of commitments
##### (a) In general

Notwithstanding any limitations on prepayment or voluntary termination under this subchapter, an owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination, subject to compliance with the provisions of section 4113 of this title , under one of the following circumstances:

(1)

(A) The Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4109(a) of this title , but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan during the 15-month period beginning on the date of approval.

(B) After the date that the housing would have been eligible for prepayment pursuant to the terms of the mortgage (notwithstanding this subchapter), the Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the 1st fiscal year beginning after such approval, or (ii) the expiration of the 6-month period beginning on the date of approval.

(C) The Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4110 or 4111 of this title for any eligible low-income housing not covered by subparagraph (B), but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the 1st fiscal year beginning after such approval, or (ii) the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of approval.

(2) An owner who intended to transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, and fully complied with the provisions of such section, did not receive any bona fide offers from any qualified purchasers within the applicable time periods. In the event that the purchaser under the plan of action is unable to consummate the purchase for reasons other than the failure of the Secretary to provide incentives, an owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination subject to the provisions of sections 4110 and 4111 of this title.
