### CHAPTER 55— ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE (LIBOR)
#### § 5801. Findings and purpose
##### (b) Purpose

It is the purpose of this chapter

(1) to establish a clear and uniform process, on a nationwide basis, for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate, without affecting the ability of parties to use any appropriate benchmark rate in new contracts;

(2) to preclude litigation related to existing contracts the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate;

(3) to allow existing contracts that reference LIBOR but provide for the use of a clearly defined and practicable replacement rate, to operate according to their terms; and

(4) to address LIBOR references in Federal law.
