#### § 635j. Export financing program to foster foreign trade and commercial interest of the United States
##### (a) Congressional statement of policy

It is the policy of the Congress that the Export-Import Bank of the United States should facilitate through loans, guarantees, and insurance (including coinsurance and reinsurance) those export transactions which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Bank, offer sufficient likelihood of repayment to justify the Bank’s support in order to actively foster the foreign trade and long-term commercial interest of the United States.
