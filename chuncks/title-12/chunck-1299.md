### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1715n. Miscellaneous mortgage insurance
##### (d) Insurance of loans made to cover operating losses of certain projects having existing mortgages insured by Secretary

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans made to cover the operating losses of certain projects that have existing project mortgages insured by the Secretary. Insurance under this subsection shall be in the Secretary’s discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term “operating loss” means the amount by which the sum of the taxes, interest on the mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premiums, hazard insurance premiums, and the expense of maintenance and operation of the project covered by the mortgage, exceeds the income of the project.

(2) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph

(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988 ; and (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling;

(B) the operating loss shall have occurred during the first 24 months after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary; and

(C) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding the operating loss.

(3) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph

(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988 ; (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling; and (iii) shall not cover a subsidized project, as defined by the Secretary;

(B) the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the unreimbursed cash contributions made on or after March 18, 1987 , by the project owner for the use of the project, during any period of consecutive months (not exceeding 24 months) in the first 10 years after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary, except that in no event may the amount of the loan exceed the operating loss during such period;

(C) the loan shall be made within 10 years after the end of the period of consecutive months referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and

(D) the project shall meet all applicable underwriting and other requirements of the Secretary at the time the loan is to be made.

(4) Any loan insured pursuant to this subsection shall (A) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; (B) be secured in such manner as the Secretary shall require; (C) be limited to a term not exceeding the unexpired term of the original mortgage; and (D) be insured under the same section as the original mortgage. The Secretary may provide insurance pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), or pursuant to both such paragraphs, in connection with an existing project mortgage, except that the Secretary may not provide insurance pursuant to both such paragraphs in connection with the same period of months referred to in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B). The Secretary is authorized to collect a premium charge for insurance of loans pursuant to this subsection in an amount computed at the same premium rate as is applicable to the original mortgage. This premium shall be payable in cash or in debentures of the insurance fund under which the loan is insured at par plus accrued interest. In the event of a failure of the borrower to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage, both the loan and original mortgage shall be considered in default, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to insurance benefits, computed in the same manner as for the original mortgage, except that in determining the interest rate under section 1715 o of this title for the debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the loan, the date of the commitment to insure the loan and the insurance date of the loan shall be taken into consideration rather than the commitment or insurance date for the original mortgage.

(5) A loan involving a project covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715e of this title that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be the obligation of such fund, and loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z–1 of this title or under any section of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.

(6) In determining the amount of an operating loss loan to be insured pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not reduce such amount solely to reflect any amounts placed in escrow (at the time the existing project mortgage was insured) for initial operating deficits. If an operating loss loan was insured by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection before October 28, 1992 , and was reduced solely to reflect the amount placed in escrow for initial operating deficits, the Secretary shall insure, to the extent of the availability of insurance authority provided in appropriation Acts, an increase in the existing loan or a separate loan, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount permitted under this subsection and the applicable underwriting requirements established by the Secretary and in effect at the time the loan is to be made, or (B) the amount of the escrow for initial operating deficits.
