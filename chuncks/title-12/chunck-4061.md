A State receiving grant amounts under this subsection may designate a State housing finance agency, housing and community development entity, tribally designated housing entity (as such term is defined in section 4103 of title 25 ), or any other qualified instrumentality of the State to receive such grant amounts.

(3) Distribution to States by needs-based formula

(A) In general

The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a formula within 12 months of July 30, 2008 , to distribute amounts made available under this subsection to each State to provide affordable housing to extremely low- and very low-income households.

(B) Basis for formula

The formula required under subparagraph (A) shall include the following:

(i) The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in all the States.

(ii) The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to very low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to very low-income renter households in all the States.

(iii) The ratio of extremely low-income renter households in the State living with either (I) incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, (II) more than 1 person per room, or (III) paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs, to the aggregate number of extremely low-income renter households living with either (IV) incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, (V) more than 1 person per room, or (VI) paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs in all the States.

(iv) The ratio of very low-income renter households in the State paying more than 50 percent of income on rent relative to the aggregate number of very low-income renter households paying more than 50 percent of income on rent in all the States.

(v) The resulting sum calculated from the factors described in clauses (i) through (iv) shall be multiplied by the relative cost of construction in the State. For purposes of this subclause, 1 the term “cost of construction”

(I) means the cost of construction or building rehabilitation in the State relative to the national cost of construction or building rehabilitation; and

(II) shall be calculated such that values higher than 1.0 indicate that the State’s construction costs are higher than the national average, a value of 1.0 indicates that the State’s construction costs are exactly the same as the national average, and values lower than 1.0 indicate that the State’s cost of construction are lower than the national average.

(C) Priority

The formula required under subparagraph (A) shall give priority emphasis and consideration to the factor described in subparagraph (B)(i).

In each fiscal year other than fiscal year 2009, the Secretary shall make a grant to each State in an amount that is equal to the formula amount determined under paragraph (3) for that State.

(C) Minimum State allocations

If the formula amount determined under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year would allocate less than $3,000,000 to any of the 50 States of the United States or the District of Columbia, the allocation for such State of the United States or the District of Columbia shall be $3,000,000, and the increase shall be deducted pro rata from the allocations made to all other of the States (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title ).
