(B) to occupy a unit in another multifamily housing project owned by the Secretary;

(C) to obtain housing assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [ 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.]; or

(D) to receive any other available similar relocation assistance as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
