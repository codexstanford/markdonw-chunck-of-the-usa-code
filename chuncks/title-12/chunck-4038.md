### CHAPTER 46— GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES
#### § 4562. Single-family housing goals
##### (i) Goals credit

The Director shall determine whether an enterprise shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals established pursuant to section 4562 and 4563 of this title. In making any such determination, the Director shall consider whether a transaction or activity of an enterprise is substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either (1) creates a new market, or (2) adds liquidity to an existing market. No credit toward the achievement of the housing goals and subgoals established under this section may be given to the purchase of mortgages, including any transaction or activity of an enterprise determined to be substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase, that is determined to be unacceptable or contrary to good lending practices, inconsistent with safety and soundness, or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, pursuant to regulations issued by the Director.
