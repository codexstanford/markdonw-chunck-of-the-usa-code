##### (k) Mortgage and project sales

(1) In general

The Secretary may not approve the sale of any loan or mortgage held by the Secretary (including any loan or mortgage owned by the Government National Mortgage Association) on any subsidized project or formerly subsidized project, unless such sale is made as part of a transaction that will ensure that such project will continue to operate at least until the maturity date of such loan or mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the loan or mortgage was made or insured prior to the assignment of the loan or mortgage on such project to the Secretary.

(2) Sale of certain projects

The Secretary may not approve the sale of any subsidized project

(A) that is subject to a mortgage held by the Secretary, or

(B) if the sale transaction involves the provision of any additional subsidy funds by the Secretary or a recasting of the mortgage, unless such sale is made as part of a transaction that will ensure that the project will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the loan or mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the loan or mortgage was made or insured prior to the proposed sale of the project.

(3) Mortgage sales to State and local governments

Notwithstanding any provision of law that requires competitive sales or bidding, the Secretary may carry out negotiated sales of mortgages held by the Secretary, without the competitive selection of purchasers or intermediaries, to units of general local government or State agencies, or groups of investors that include at least one such unit of general local government or State agency, if the negotiations are conducted with such agencies, except that

(A) the terms of any such sale shall include the agreement of the purchasing agency or unit of local government or State agency to act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in such mortgages, in a manner consistent with maintaining the projects that are subject to such mortgages for occupancy by the general tenant group intended to be served by the applicable mortgage insurance program, including, to the extent the Secretary determines appropriate, authorizing such unit of local government or State agency to enforce the provisions of any regulatory agreement or other program requirements applicable to the related projects; and

(B) the sales prices for such mortgages shall be, in the determination of the Secretary, the best prices that may be obtained for such mortgages from a unit of general local government or State agency, consistent with the expectation and intention that the projects financed will be retained for use under the applicable mortgage insurance program for the life of the initial mortgage insurance contract.

(4) Sale of mortgages covering unsubsidized projects

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may sell mortgages held on projects that are not subsidized or formerly subsidized projects on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(5) Mortgage sale demonstration

The Secretary may carry out a demonstration to test the feasibility of restructuring and disposing of troubled multifamily mortgages held by the Secretary through the establishment of partnerships with public, private, and nonprofit entities.

(6) Project sale demonstration

The Secretary may carry out a demonstration to test the feasibility of disposing of troubled multifamily housing projects that are owned by the Secretary through the establishment of partnerships with public, private, and nonprofit entities.
