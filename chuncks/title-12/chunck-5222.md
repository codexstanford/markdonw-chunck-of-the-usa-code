##### (d) Additional considerations

In making a determination that a State other credit support program is eligible for Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State program, the Secretary shall take into account the following additional considerations:

(1) The anticipated benefits to the State, its businesses, and its residents to be derived from the Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the approved State other credit support program, including the extent to which resulting small business lending will expand economic opportunities.

(2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the management team of the State other credit support program.

(3) The capacity of the State other credit support program to manage increases in the volume of its small business lending.

(4) The internal accounting and administrative controls systems of the State other credit support program, and the extent to which they can provide reasonable assurance that funds of the State program are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation.

(5) The soundness of the program design and implementation plan of the State other credit support program.
