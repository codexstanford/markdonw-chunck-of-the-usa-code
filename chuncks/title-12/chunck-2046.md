### CHAPTER 14— FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS
#### § 1790d. Prompt corrective action
##### (c) Net worth categories

(1) In general

For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:

(A) Well capitalized

An insured credit union is “well capitalized” if

(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and

(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).

(B) Adequately capitalized

An insured credit union is “adequately capitalized” if

(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and

(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).

(C) Undercapitalized

An insured credit union is “undercapitalized” if

(i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or

(ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).

(D) Significantly undercapitalized

An insured credit union is “significantly undercapitalized”

(i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or

(ii) if

(I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and

(II) it

(aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f); or

(bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.

(E) Critically undercapitalized

An insured credit union is “critically undercapitalized” if it has a net worth ratio of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).

(2) Adjusting net worth levels

(A) In general

If, for purposes of section 1831 o (c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831 o of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).

(B) Determinations required

The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board

(i) determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and

(ii) determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.

(C) Transition period required

If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.
