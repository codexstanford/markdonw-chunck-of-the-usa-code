The Fund shall approve such State to be a participating State, and to be eligible for reimbursements by the Fund pursuant to section 4747 of this title , if the State

(A) satisfies the requirements of subsections (a) and (b); and

(B) certifies that each affected financial institution has satisfied the requirements of section 4744 of this title .

(A) Status of institutions

If a State is approved for participation under paragraph (1), each financial institution with a participation agreement in effect with the participating State shall immediately be considered a participating financial institution. Reimbursements may be made under section 4747  1 of this title in connection with all contributions made to the reserve fund by the State in connection with lending that occurs on or after the date on which the Fund approves the State for participation.

(B) Effective date of participation

If an amended participation agreement that conforms with section 4745 of this title is required in order to secure participation approval by the Fund, contributions subject to reimbursement under section 4747 of this title shall include only those contributions made to a reserve fund with respect to loans enrolled on or after the date that an amended participation agreement between the participating State and the participating financial institution becomes effective.

(C) Use of accumulated reserve funds

A State that is approved for participation in accordance with this subsection may continue to implement the program  2 utilizing the reserve funds accumulated under the State program.
