As used in this subsection

(A) the term “home improvement loan” means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advance of credit made

(i) for the purpose of financing the improvement of an existing structure (or in connection with an existing structure) which was constructed not less than ten years prior to the making of such loan, advance of credit, or purchase, and which is used or will be used primarily for residential purposes: Provided , That a home improvement loan shall include a loan, advance, or purchase with respect to the improvement of a structure which was constructed less than ten years prior to the making of such loan, advance, or purchase if the proceeds are or will be used primarily for major structural improvements, or to correct defects which were not known at the time of the completion of the structure or which were caused by fire, flood, windstorm, or other casualty; or

(ii) for the purpose of enabling the borrower to pay that part of the cost of the construction or installation of sidewalks, curbs, gutters, street paving, street lights, sewers, or other public improvements, adjacent to or in the vicinity of property owned by him and used primarily for residential purposes, which is assessed against him or for which he is otherwise legally liable as the owner of such property;

(B) the term “improvement” means conservation, repair, restoration, rehabilitation, conversion, alteration, enlargement, or remodeling; and

(C) the term “financial institution” means a lender approved by the Secretary as eligible for insurance under section 1703 of this title or a mortgagee approved under section 1709(b)(1) of this title .

(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a home improvement loan shall

(i) not exceed the Secretary’s estimate of the cost of improvement, or $12,000 per family unit, whichever is the lesser, and be limited as required by paragraph (11): Provided , That the Secretary may, by regulation, increase such amount by not to exceed 45 per centum in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require;

(ii) be limited to an amount which when added to any outstanding indebtedness related to the property (as determined by the Secretary) creates a total outstanding indebtedness which does not exceed the limits provided in subsection (d)(3) for properties (of the same type) other than new construction;

(iii) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee;

(iv) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed twenty years from the beginning of amortization of the loan;

(v) comply with such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe; and

(vi) represent the obligation of a borrower who is the owner of the property improved, or a lessee of the property under a lease for not less than 99 years which is renewable or under a lease having an expiration date in excess of 10 years later than the maturity date of the loan.

(3) Any home improvement loan insured under this subsection may be refinanced and extended in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, but in no event for an additional amount or term in excess of the maximum provided for in this subsection.

(4) Repealed. Pub. L. 89–117, title XI, § 1108(h)(3) , Aug. 10, 1965 , 79 Stat. 505 .

(5) The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of home improvement loans under this subsection but in the case of any such loan such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the loan outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the financial institution either in cash or in debentures (at par plus accrued interest) issued by the Secretary as obligations of the General Insurance Fund, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, and the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the loan is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the loan. If the Secretary finds upon presentation of a loan for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the loan complies with the provisions of this subsection, such loan may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event the principal obligation of any loan accepted for insurance under this subsection is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the financial institution for the account of the borrower all, or such portions as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.

(6) In cases of defaults on loans insured under this subsection, upon receiving notice of default, the Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may acquire the loan and any security therefor upon payment to the financial institution in cash or in debentures (as provided in the loan insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan, plus any accrued interest, any advances approved by the Secretary made previously by the financial institution under the provisions of the loan instruments, and reimbursement for such collection costs, court costs, and attorney fees as may be approved by the Secretary. If the insurance payment is made in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.

(7) Debentures issued under this subsection shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations, and shall be dated as of the date the loan is assigned to the Secretary and shall bear interest from that date. They shall bear interest at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715 o of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature ten years after their date of issuance. They shall be exempt from taxation as provided in section 1713(i) of this title with respect to debentures issued under that section. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, the guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amounts so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures. Debentures issued under this subsection shall be in such form and amounts; shall be subject to such terms and conditions; and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.

(9)

(A) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no home improvement loan executed in connection with the improvement of a structure for use as rental accommodations for five or more families shall be insured under this subsection unless the borrower has agreed (i) to certify, upon completion of the improvement and prior to final endorsement of the loan, either that the actual cost of improvement equaled or exceeded the proceeds of the home improvement loan, or the amount by which the proceeds of the loan exceed the actual cost, as the case may be, and (ii) to pay forthwith to the financial institution, for application to the reduction of the principal of the loan, the amount, if any, certified to be in excess of the actual cost of improvement. Upon the Secretary’s approval of the borrower’s certification as required under this paragraph, the certification shall be final and incontestable, except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the borrower.

(B) As used in subparagraph (A), the term “actual cost” means the cost to the borrower of the improvement, including the amounts paid for labor, materials, construction contracts, off-site public utilities, streets, organization and legal expenses, such allocations of general overhead items as are acceptable to the Secretary, and other items of expense approved by the Secretary, plus a reasonable allowance for builder’s profit if the borrower is also the builder, as defined by the Secretary, and excluding the amount of any kickbacks, rebates, or trade discounts received in connection with the improvement.

(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized and empowered (i) to make expenditures and advances out of funds made available by this chapter to preserve and protect his interest in any security for, or the lien or priority of the lien securing, any loan or other indebtedness owing to, insured by, or acquired by the Secretary or by the United States under this subsection, or section 1703 or 1709(k) of this title; and (ii) to bid for and to purchase at any foreclosure or other sale or otherwise acquire property pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, attached, or levied upon to secure the payment of any loan or other indebtedness owing to or acquired by the Secretary or by the United States under this subsection or section 1703 or 1709(k) of this title. The authority conferred by this paragraph may be exercised as provided in the last sentence of section 1710(g) of this title .

(11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no home improvement loan made in whole or in part for the purpose specified in clause (A)(ii) of the second sentence of paragraph (1) shall be insured under this subsection if such loan (or the portion thereof which is attributable to such purpose), when added to the aggregate principal balance of any outstanding loans insured under this subsection or section 1709(k) of this title which were made to the same borrower for the purpose so specified (or the portion of such aggregate balance which is attributable to such purpose), would exceed $10,000 or such additional amount as the Secretary has by regulation prescribed in any geographical area where he finds cost levels so require pursuant to the authority vested in him by the proviso in paragraph (2)(i) of this subsection.
