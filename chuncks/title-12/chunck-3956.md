#### § 4516. Funding
##### (c) Increased costs of regulation

(1) Increase for inadequate capitalization

The semiannual payments made pursuant to subsection (b) by any regulated entity that is not classified (for purposes of subchapter II) as adequately capitalized may be increased, as necessary, in the discretion of the Director to pay additional estimated costs of regulation of the regulated entity.

(2) Adjustment for enforcement activities

The Director may adjust the amounts of any semiannual payments for an assessment under subsection (a) that are to be paid pursuant to subsection (b) by a regulated entity, as necessary in the discretion of the Director, to ensure that the costs of enforcement activities under this Act for a regulated entity are borne only by such regulated entity.

(3) Additional assessment for deficiencies

If at any time, as a result of increased costs of regulation of a regulated entity that is not classified (for purposes of subchapter II) as adequately capitalized or as the result of supervisory or enforcement activities under this Act for a regulated entity, the amount available from any semiannual payment made by such regulated entity pursuant to subsection (b) is insufficient to cover the costs of the Agency with respect to such entity, the Director may make and collect from such regulated entity an immediate assessment to cover the amount of such deficiency for the semiannual period. If, at the end of any semiannual period during which such an assessment is made, any amount remains from such assessment, such remaining amount shall be deducted from the assessment for such regulated entity for the following semiannual period.
