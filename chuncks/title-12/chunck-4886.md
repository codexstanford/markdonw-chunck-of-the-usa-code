### CHAPTER 53— WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
#### § 5432. Transfer of employees
##### (h) Pay

(1) 30-month protection

Except as provided in paragraph (2), during the 30-month period beginning on the date on which the employee was transferred under this part, a transferred employee shall be paid at a rate that is not less than the basic rate of pay, including any geographic differential, that the transferred employee received during the pay period immediately preceding the date on which the employee was transferred. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the employee was receiving a higher rate of basic pay on a temporary basis (because of a temporary assignment, temporary promotion, or other temporary action) immediately before the transfer, the Agency may reduce the rate of basic pay on the date the rate would have been reduced but for the transfer, and the protected rate for the remainder of the 30-month period will be the reduced rate that would have applied but for the transfer.

(2) Exceptions

The Comptroller of the Currency or the Corporation may reduce the rate of basic pay of a transferred employee

(A) for cause, including for unacceptable performance; or

(B) with the consent of the transferred employee.

(3) Protection only while employed

This subsection shall apply to a transferred employee only during the period that the transferred employee remains employed by Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Corporation.

(4) Pay increases permitted

Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Chairperson of the Corporation to increase the pay of a transferred employee.
