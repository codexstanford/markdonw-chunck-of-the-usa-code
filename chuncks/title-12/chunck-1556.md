##### (b) Purpose

The purpose of the HOPE for Homeowners Program is

(1) to create an FHA program, participation in which is voluntary on the part of homeowners and existing loan holders to insure refinanced loans for distressed borrowers to support long-term, sustainable homeownership;

(2) to allow homeowners to avoid foreclosure by reducing the principle  1 balance outstanding, and interest rate charged, on their mortgages;

(3) to help stabilize and provide confidence in mortgage markets by bringing transparency to the value of assets based on mortgage assets;

(4) to target mortgage assistance under this section to homeowners for their principal residence;

(5) to enhance the administrative capacity of the FHA to carry out its expanded role under the HOPE for Homeowners Program;

(6) to ensure the HOPE for Homeowners Program remains in effect only for as long as is necessary to provide stability to the housing market; and

(7) to provide servicers of delinquent mortgages with additional methods and approaches to avoid foreclosure.
