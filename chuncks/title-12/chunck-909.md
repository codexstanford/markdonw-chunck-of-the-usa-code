#### § 1464. Federal savings associations
##### (r) Out-of-State branches

(1) No Federal savings association may establish, retain, or operate a branch outside the State in which the Federal savings association has its home office, unless the association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [ 26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(19) ] or meets the asset composition test imposed by subparagraph (C) of that section on institutions seeking so to qualify, or qualifies as a qualified thrift lender, as determined under section 1467a(m) of this title . No out-of-State branch so established shall be retained or operated unless the total assets of the Federal savings association attributable to all branches of the Federal savings association in that State would qualify the branches as a whole, were they otherwise eligible, for treatment as a domestic building and loan association under section 7701(a)(19) or as a qualified thrift lender, as determined under section 1467a(m) of this title , as applicable.

(2) The limitations of paragraph (1) shall not apply if

(A) the branch results from a transaction authorized under section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1823(k) ];

(B) the branch was authorized for the Federal savings association prior to October 15, 1982 ;

(C) the law of the State where the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the association was a savings association or savings bank chartered by the State in which its home office is located; or

(D) the branch was operated lawfully as a branch under State law prior to the association’s conversion to a Federal charter.

(3) The Comptroller of the Currency, for good cause shown, may allow Federal savings associations up to 2 years to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
