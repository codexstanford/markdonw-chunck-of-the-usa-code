(IV) the Corporation otherwise determines that the institution is in a troubled condition (as defined in regulations issued by the Corporation); and

(B) includes a payment that would be a golden parachute payment but for the fact that the payment was made before the date referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) if the payment was made in contemplation of the occurrence of an event described in any subclause of subparagraph (A); but

(C) does not include

(i) a payment made under a retirement plan that is qualified (or is intended to be qualified) under section 401 of title 26 or other nondiscriminatory benefit plan;

(iii) a payment made by reason of the death or disability of an institution-related party.

(2) Indemnification payment

The term “indemnification payment” means a payment (or any agreement to make a payment) by any Farm Credit System institution for the benefit of any person who is or was an institution-related party, to pay or reimburse the person for any liability or legal expense with regard to any administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Farm Credit Administration that results in a final order under which the person

(A) is assessed a civil money penalty; or

(B) is removed or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the institution.

(3) Institution-related party

The term “institution-related party” means

(A) a director, officer, employee, or agent for a Farm Credit System institution or any conservator or receiver of such an institution;

(C) an independent contractor (including any attorney, appraiser, or accountant) that knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of any law or regulation, any breach of fiduciary duty, or any unsafe or unsound practice that caused or is likely to cause more than a minimal financial loss to, or a significant adverse effect on, the Farm Credit System institution.

(4) Liability or legal expense

The term “liability or legal expense” means

(B) any segregation of any funds or assets for the purpose of making, or under an agreement to make, any payment after the date on which the funds or assets are segregated, without regard to whether the obligation to make the payment is contingent on

(i) the determination, after that date, of the liability for the payment of the amount; or

(ii) the liquidation, after that date, of the amount of the payment.
