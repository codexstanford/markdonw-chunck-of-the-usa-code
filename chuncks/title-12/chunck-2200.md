### CHAPTER 16— FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
#### § 1821. Insurance Funds
##### (g) Subrogation of Corporation

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, the law of any State, or the constitution of any State, the Corporation, upon the payment to any depositor as provided in subsection (f) in connection with any insured depository institution or insured branch described in such subsection or the assumption of any deposit in such institution or branch by another insured depository institution pursuant to this section or section 1823 of this title , shall be subrogated to all rights of the depositor against such institution or branch to the extent of such payment or assumption.

(2) Dividends on subrogated amounts

The subrogation of the Corporation under paragraph (1) with respect to any insured depository institution shall include the right on the part of the Corporation to receive the same dividends from the proceeds of the assets of such institution and recoveries on account of stockholders’ liability as would have been payable to the depositor on a claim for the insured deposit, but such depositor shall retain such claim for any uninsured or unassumed portion of the deposit.

(3) Waiver of certain claims

With respect to any bank which closes after May 25, 1938 , the Corporation shall waive, in favor only of any person against whom stockholders’ individual liability may be asserted, any claim on account of such liability in excess of the liability, if any, to the bank or its creditors, for the amount unpaid upon such stock in such bank; but any such waiver shall be effected in such manner and on such terms and conditions as will not increase recoveries or dividends on account of claims to which the Corporation is not subrogated.

(4) Applicability of State law

Subject to subsection (d)(11), if the Corporation is appointed pursuant to subsection (c)(3), or determines not to invoke the authority conferred in subsection (c)(4), the rights of depositors and other creditors of any State depository institution shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of State law.
