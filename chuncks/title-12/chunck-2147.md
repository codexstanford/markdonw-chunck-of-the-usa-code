######## (A) Notice to State Agency .

Upon receiving any notice under this subsection, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall forward a copy thereof to the appropriate State depository institution supervisory agency if the depository institution the voting shares of which are sought to be acquired is a State depository institution, and shall allow thirty days within which the views and recommendations of such State depository institution supervisory agency may be submitted. The appropriate Federal banking agency shall give due consideration to the views and recommendations of such State agency in determining whether to disapprove any proposed acquisition. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that it must act immediately upon any notice of a proposed acquisition in order to prevent the probable default of the depository institution involved in the proposed acquisition, such Federal banking agency may dispense with the requirements of this paragraph or, if a copy of the notice is forwarded to the State depository institution supervisory agency, such Federal banking agency may request that the views and recommendations of such State depository institution supervisory agency be submitted immediately in any form or by any means acceptable to such Federal banking agency.
