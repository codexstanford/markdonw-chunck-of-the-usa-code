### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1709. Insurance of mortgages
##### (y) Requirements for mortgages for condominiums

(1) Project recertification requirements

Notwithstanding any other law, regulation, or guideline of the Secretary, including chapter 2.4 of the Condominium Project Approval and Processing Guide of the FHA, the Secretary shall streamline the project certification requirements that are applicable to the insurance under this section for mortgages for condominium projects so that recertifications are substantially less burdensome than certifications. The Secretary shall consider lengthening the time between certifications for approved properties, and allowing updating of information rather than resubmission.

(2) Commercial space requirements

Notwithstanding any other law, regulation, or guideline of the Secretary, including chapter 2.1.3 of the Condominium Project Approval and Processing Guide of the FHA, in providing for exceptions to the requirement for the insurance of a mortgage on a condominium property under this section regarding the percentage of the floor space of a condominium property that may be used for nonresidential or commercial purposes, the Secretary shall provide that

(A) any request for such an exception and the determination of the disposition of such request may be made, at the option of the requester, under the direct endorsement lender review and approval process or under the HUD review and approval process through the applicable field office of the Department; and

(B) in determining whether to allow such an exception for a condominium property, factors relating to the economy for the locality in which such project is located or specific to project, 2 including the total number of family units in the project, shall be considered. Not later than the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on July 29, 2016 , the Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this paragraph, which shall include any standards, training requirements, and remedies and penalties that the Secretary considers appropriate.

(3) Transfer fees

Notwithstanding any other law, regulation, or guideline of the Secretary, including chapter 1.8.8 of the Condominium Project Approval and Processing Guide of the FHA and section 203.41 of the Secretary’s regulations (24 CFR 203.41), existing standards of the Federal Housing Finance Agency relating to encumbrances under private transfer fee covenants shall apply to the insurance of mortgages by the Secretary under this section to the same extent and in the same manner that such standards apply to the purchasing, investing in, and otherwise dealing in mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. If the provisions of part 1228 of the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s regulations (12 CFR part 1228) are amended or otherwise changed after July 29, 2016 , the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall adopt any such amendments or changes for purposes of this paragraph, unless the Secretary causes to be published in the Federal Register a notice explaining why the Secretary will disregard such amendments or changes within 90 days after the effective date of such amendments or changes.

(4) Owner-occupancy requirement

(A) Establishment of percentage requirement

Not later than the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on July 29, 2016 , the Secretary shall, by rule, notice, or mortgagee letter, issue guidance regarding the percentage of units that must be occupied by the owners as a principal residence or a secondary residence (as such terms are defined by the Secretary), or must have been sold to owners who intend to meet such occupancy requirements, including justifications for the percentage requirements, in order for a condominium project to be acceptable to the Secretary for insurance under this section of a mortgage within such condominium property.

(B) Failure to act

If the Secretary fails to issue the guidance required under subparagraph (A) before the expiration of the 90-day period specified in such clause, the following provisions shall apply:

(i) 35 percent requirement

In order for a condominium project to be acceptable to the Secretary for insurance under this section, at least 35 percent of all family units (including units not covered by FHA-insured mortgages) must be occupied by the owners as a principal residence or a secondary residence (as such terms are defined by the Secretary), or must have been sold to owners who intend to meet such occupancy requirement.

(ii) Other considerations

The Secretary may increase the percentage applicable pursuant to clause (i) to a condominium project on a project-by-project or regional basis, and in determining such percentage for a project shall consider factors relating to the economy for the locality in which such project is located or specific to project, 2 including the total number of family units in the project.
