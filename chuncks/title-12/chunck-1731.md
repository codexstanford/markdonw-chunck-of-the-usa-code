### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1735f–19. Partial payment of claims on defaulted mortgages and in connection with mortgage restructuring
##### (a) Defaulted mortgages

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary is requested to accept assignment of a mortgage insured by the Secretary that covers a multifamily housing project (as such term is defined in section 1701z–11(b) of this title ) or a health care facility (including a nursing home, intermediate care facility, or board and care home (as those terms are defined in section 1715w of this title ), a hospital (as that term is defined in section 1715z–7 of this title ), or a group practice facility (as that term is defined in section 1749aaa–5 of this title )) and the Secretary determines that partial payment would be less costly to the Federal Government than other reasonable alternatives for maintaining the low-income character of the project, or for keeping the health care facility operational to serve community needs, the Secretary may request the mortgagee, in lieu of assignment, to

(1) accept partial payment of the claim under the mortgage insurance contract; and

(2) recast the mortgage, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine.
