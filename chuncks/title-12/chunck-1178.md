### CHAPTER 13— NATIONAL HOUSING
#### § 1701z–16. Energy efficient mortgages pilot program
##### (c) Definitions

For purposes of this section:

(1) The term “base loan” means any mortgage loan for a residential building eligible for insurance under title II of the National Housing Act [ 12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.] or title 38 that does not include the cost of cost-effective energy improvements.

(2) The term “cost-effective” means, with respect to energy efficiency improvements to a residential building, improvements that result in the total present value cost of the improvements (including any maintenance and repair expenses) being less than the total present value of the energy saved over the useful life of the improvement, when 100 percent of the cost of improvements is added to the base loan. For purposes of this paragraph, savings and cost-effectiveness shall be determined pursuant to a home energy rating report sufficient for purposes of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or by other technically accurate methods.

(3) The term “energy efficient mortgage” means a mortgage on a residential building that recognizes the energy savings of a home that has cost-effective energy saving construction or improvements (including solar water heaters, solar-assisted air conditioners and ventilators, super-insulation, and insulating glass and film) and that has the effect of not disqualifying a borrower who, but for the expenditures on energy saving construction or improvements, would otherwise have qualified for a base loan.

(4) The term “residential building” means any attached or unattached single family residence.
