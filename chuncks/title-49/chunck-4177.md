###### (e) Letters of Intent .

(1) The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to the sponsor stating an intention to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Government’s share of allowable project costs, for an airport development project (including costs of formulating the project) at a primary or reliever airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the sponsor for the Government’s share of allowable project costs, as amounts become available, if the sponsor, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under this subchapter.

(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a project

(A) about which the sponsor notifies the Secretary, before the project begins, of the sponsor’s intent to carry out the project;

(B) that will comply with all statutory and administrative requirements that would apply to the project if it were carried out with amounts made available under this subchapter; and

(C) that meets the criteria of section 47115(d) and, if for a project at a commercial service airport having at least 0.25 percent of the boardings each year at all such airports, the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly.

(3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31 , and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.

(4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out section 48103 of this title , less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.

(5) Letters of intent .

The Secretary may not require an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility charge under section 40117 in order to obtain a letter of intent under this section.

(6) Limitation on statutory construction .

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this subsection in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.

(7) Partnership program airports .

The Secretary may issue a letter of intent under this section to an airport sponsor with an approved application under section 47134(b) if

(A) the application was approved in fiscal year 2019; and

(B) the project meets all other requirements set forth in this chapter.
