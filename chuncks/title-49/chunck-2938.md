#### § 40117. Passenger facility charges
###### (b) General Authority .

(1) The Secretary of Transportation may authorize under this section an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility charge of $1, $2, or $3 on each paying passenger of an air carrier or foreign air carrier boarding an aircraft at an airport the agency controls to finance an eligible airport-related project, including making payments for debt service on indebtedness incurred to carry out the project, to be carried out in connection with the airport or any other airport the agency controls.

(2) A State, political subdivision of a State, or authority of a State or political subdivision that is not the eligible agency may not regulate or prohibit the imposition or collection of a passenger facility charge or the use of the passenger facility revenue.

(3) A passenger facility charge may be imposed on a passenger of an air carrier or foreign air carrier originating or connecting at the commercial service airport that the agency controls.

(4) In lieu of authorizing a charge under paragraph (1), the Secretary may authorize under this section an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility charge of $4.00 or $4.50 on each paying passenger of an air carrier or foreign air carrier boarding an aircraft at an airport the agency controls to finance an eligible airport-related project, including making payments for debt service on indebtedness incurred to carry out the project.

(5) Maximum cost for certain low-emission technology projects .

The maximum cost that may be financed by imposition of a passenger facility charge under this section for a project described in subsection (a)(3)(G) with respect to a vehicle or ground support equipment may not exceed the incremental amount of the project cost that is greater than the cost of acquiring a vehicle or equipment that is not low-emission and would be used for the same purpose, or the cost of low-emission retrofitting, as determined by the Secretary.

(6) Debt service for certain projects .

In addition to the uses specified in paragraphs (1) and (4), the Secretary may authorize a passenger facility charge imposed under paragraph (1) or (4) to be used for making payments for debt service on indebtedness incurred to carry out at the airport a project that is not an eligible airport-related project if the Secretary determines that such use is necessary due to the financial need of the airport.

(7) Noise mitigation for certain schools.

(A) In general .

In addition to the uses specified in paragraphs (1), (4), and (6), the Secretary may authorize a passenger facility charge imposed under paragraph (1) or (4) at a large hub airport that is the subject of an amended judgment and final order in condemnation filed on January 7, 1980 , by the Superior Court of the State of California for the county of Los Angeles, to be used for a project to carry out noise mitigation for a building, or for the replacement of a relocatable building with a permanent building, in the noise impacted area surrounding the airport at which such building is used primarily for educational purposes, notwithstanding the air easement granted or any terms to the contrary in such judgment and final order, if

(i) the Secretary determines that the building is adversely affected by airport noise;

(ii) the building is owned or chartered by the school district that was the plaintiff in case number 986,442 or 986,446, which was resolved by such judgment and final order;

(iii) the project is for a school identified in 1 of the settlement agreements effective February 16, 2005 , between the airport and each of the school districts;

(iv) in the case of a project to replace a relocatable building with a permanent building, the eligible project costs are limited to the actual structural construction costs necessary to mitigate aircraft noise in instructional classrooms to an interior noise level meeting current standards of the Federal Aviation Administration; and

(v) the project otherwise meets the requirements of this section for authorization of a passenger facility charge.

(B) Eligible project costs .

In subparagraph (A)(iv), the term “eligible project costs” means the difference between the cost of standard school construction and the cost of construction necessary to mitigate classroom noise to the standards of the Federal Aviation Administration.
