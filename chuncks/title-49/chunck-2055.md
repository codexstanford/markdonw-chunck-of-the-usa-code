#### § 24910. Rail cooperative research program
###### (b) Content .

The program to be carried out under this section shall include research designed

(1) to identify the unique aspects and attributes of rail passenger and freight service;

(2) to develop more accurate models for evaluating the impact of rail passenger and freight service, including the effects on highway and airport and airway congestion, environmental quality, and energy consumption;

(3) to develop a better understanding of modal choice as it affects rail passenger and freight transportation, including development of better models to predict utilization;

(4) to recommend priorities for technology demonstration and development;

(5) to meet additional priorities as determined by the advisory board established under subsection (c), including any recommendations made by the National Research Council;

(6) to explore improvements in management, financing, and institutional structures;

(7) to address rail capacity constraints that affect passenger and freight rail service through a wide variety of options, ranging from operating improvements to dedicated new infrastructure, taking into account the impact of such options on operations;

(8) to improve maintenance, operations, customer service, or other aspects of intercity rail passenger and freight service;

(9) to recommend objective methodologies for determining intercity passenger rail routes and services, including the establishment of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and the contraction or expansion of services or frequencies over such routes;

(10) to review the impact of equipment and operational safety standards on the further development of high-speed passenger rail operations connected to or integrated with non-high-speed freight or passenger rail operations;

(11) to recommend any legislative or regulatory changes necessary to foster further development and implementation of high-speed passenger rail operations while ensuring the safety of such operations that are connected to or integrated with non-high-speed freight or passenger rail operations;

(12) to review rail crossing safety improvements, including improvements using new safety technology;

(13) to review and develop technology designed to reduce train horn noise and its effect on communities, including broadband horn technology; and

(14) to improve overall safety of intercity passenger and freight rail operations.
