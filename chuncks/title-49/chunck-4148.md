###### (j) Use of Revenue in Hawaii .

(1) In this subsection

(A) “duty-free merchandise” and “duty-free sales enterprise” have the same meanings given those terms in section 555(b)(8) of the Tariff Act of 1930 ( 19 U.S.C. 1555(b)(8) ).

(B) “highway” and “Federal-aid system” have the same meanings given those terms in section 101(a) of title 23 .

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) of this section, Hawaii may use, for a project for construction or reconstruction of a highway on a Federal-aid system that is not more than 10 miles by road from an airport and that will facilitate access to the airport, revenue from the sales at off-airport locations in Hawaii of duty-free merchandise under a contract between Hawaii and a duty-free sales enterprise. However, the revenue resulting during a Hawaiian fiscal year may be used only if the amount of the revenue, plus amounts Hawaii receives in the fiscal year from all other sources for costs Hawaii incurs for operating all airports it operates and for debt service related to capital projects for the airports (including interest and amortization of principal costs), is more than 150 percent of the projected costs for the fiscal year.

(3)

(A) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection in a Hawaiian fiscal year that Hawaii may use may not be more than the amount that is greater than 150 percent as determined under paragraph (2).

(B) The maximum amount of revenue Hawaii may use under paragraph (2) of this subsection is $250,000,000.

(4) If a fee imposed or collected for rent, landing, or service from an aircraft operator by an airport operated by Hawaii is increased during the period from May 4, 1990 , through December 31, 1994 , by more than the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers for Honolulu, Hawaii, that the Secretary of Labor publishes during that period and if revenue derived from the fee increases because the fee increased, the amount under paragraph (3)(B) of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of the projected revenue increase in the period less the part of the increase attributable to changes in the Index in the period.

(5) Hawaii shall determine costs, revenue, and projected revenue increases referred to in this subsection and shall submit the determinations to the Secretary of Transportation. A determination is approved unless the Secretary disapproves it not later than 30 days after it is submitted.

(6) Hawaii is not eligible for a grant under section 47115 of this title in a fiscal year in which Hawaii uses under paragraph (2) of this subsection revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2). Hawaii shall repay amounts it receives in a fiscal year under a grant it is not eligible to receive because of this paragraph to the Secretary of Transportation for deposit in the discretionary fund established under section 47115.

(7)

(A) This subsection applies only to revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990 , through December 30, 1994 , and to amounts in the Airport Revenue Fund of Hawaii that are attributable to revenue before May 4, 1990 , on sales referred to in paragraph (2).

(B) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990 , through December 30, 1994 , may be used under paragraph (2) in any Hawaiian fiscal year, including a Hawaiian fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1994 .
