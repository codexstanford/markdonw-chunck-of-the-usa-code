###### (b) Reliance on Manufacturer’s Certification .

In making a certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the registered importer may rely on the manufacturer’s certification for the model to which the motor vehicle involved is substantially similar if the importer certifies that any alteration made by the importer did not affect the compliance of the safety features of the vehicle and the importer keeps records verifying the certification for the period the Secretary of Transportation prescribes.
