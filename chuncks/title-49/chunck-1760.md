In lieu of or in combination with appropriations of budget authority to cover the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees as required under section 504(b)(1) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, including the cost of a modification thereof, the Secretary may accept on behalf of an applicant for assistance under this section a commitment from a non-Federal source, including a State or local government or agency or public benefit corporation or public authority thereof, to fund in whole or in part credit risk premiums and modification costs with respect to the loan that is the subject of the application or modification. In no event shall the aggregate of appropriations of budget authority and credit risk premiums described in this paragraph with respect to a direct loan or loan guarantee be less than the cost of that direct loan or loan guarantee.

(2) Credit risk premium amount .

The Secretary shall determine the amount required for credit risk premiums under this subsection on the basis of

(B) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;

(D) consultation with the Congressional Budget Office; and

(E) any other factors the Secretary considers relevant.

(3) Creditworthiness .

Upon receipt of a proposal from an applicant under this section, the Secretary shall accept as a basis for determining the amount of the credit risk premium under paragraph (2) any of the following in addition to the value of any collateral described in paragraph (6):

(A) The net present value of a future stream of State or local subsidy income or other dedicated revenues to secure the direct loan or loan guarantee.

(i) tolls;

(ii) user fees, including operating or tenant charges, facility rents, or other fees paid by transportation service providers or operators for access to, or the use of, infrastructure, including rail lines, bridges, tunnels, yards, or stations; or

(iii) payments owing to the obligor under a public-private partnership.

(C) An investment-grade rating on the direct loan or loan guarantee, as applicable, except that if the total amount of the direct loan or loan guarantee is greater than $150,000,000, the applicant shall have an investment-grade rating from at least 2 rating agencies on the direct loan or loan guarantee.

(D) Revenue from projected freight or passenger demand for the project based on regionally developed economic forecasts, including projections of any modal diversion resulting from the project.

(4) Payment of premiums .

Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be paid to the Secretary before the disbursement of loan amounts (and in the case of a modification, before the modification is executed), to the extent appropriations are not available to the Secretary to meet the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees, including costs of modifications thereof.

(5) Cohorts of loans .

Subject to the availability of funds appropriated by Congress under section 22406(a)(2), for any direct loan issued before the date of enactment of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act ( Public Law 114–94 ) pursuant to sections 501 through 504 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 ( Public Law 94–210 ), the Secretary shall repay the credit risk premiums of such loan, with interest accrued thereon, not later than

(A) 60 days after the date of enactment of the Surface Transportation Investment Act of 2021 if the borrower has satisfied all obligations attached to such loan; or

(B) if the borrower has not yet satisfied all obligations attached to such loan, 60 days after the date on which all obligations attached to such loan have been satisfied.

(6) Collateral.

(A) Types of collateral .

An applicant or infrastructure partner may propose tangible and intangible assets as collateral, exclusive of goodwill. The Secretary, after evaluating each such asset

(i) shall accept a net liquidation value of collateral; and

(ii) shall consider and may accept

(I) the market value of collateral; or

(II) in the case of a blanket pledge or assignment of an entire operating asset or basket of assets as collateral, the market value of assets, or, the market value of the going concern, considering

(aa) inclusion in the pledge of all the assets necessary for independent operational utility of the collateral, including tangible assets such as real property, track and structure, motive power, equipment and rolling stock, stations, systems and maintenance facilities and intangible assets such as long-term shipping agreements, easements, leases and access rights such as for trackage and haulage;

(bb) interchange commitments; and

(cc) the value of the asset as determined through the cost or market approaches, or the market value of the going concern, with the latter considering discounted cash flows for a period not to exceed the term of the direct loan or loan guarantee.

(B) Appraisal standards .

In evaluating appraisals of collateral under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider

(i) adherence to the substance and principles of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, as developed by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation; and

(ii) the qualifications of the appraisers to value the type of collateral offered.

(7) Repayment of credit risk premiums .

This paragraph applies to any project that has been granted assistance under this section after the date of enactment of the Surface Transportation Investment Act of 2021.
