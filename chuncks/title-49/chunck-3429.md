###### (b) Research on Human Factors and Simulation Models .

The Administrator shall conduct or supervise research

(1) to develop a better understanding of the relationship between human factors and aviation accidents and between human factors and air safety;

(2) to enhance air traffic controller, mechanic, and flight crew performance;

(3) to develop a human-factor analysis of the hazards associated with new technologies to be used by air traffic controllers, mechanics, and flight crews;

(4) to identify innovative and effective corrective measures for human errors that adversely affect air safety;

(5) to develop dynamic simulation models of the air traffic control system and airport design and operating procedures that will provide analytical technology

(A) to predict airport and air traffic control safety and capacity problems;

(B) to evaluate planned research projects; and

(C) to test proposed revisions in airport and air traffic control operations programs;

(6) to develop a better understanding of the relationship between human factors and unmanned aircraft system safety; and

(7) to develop dynamic simulation models for integrating all classes of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system without any degradation of existing levels of safety for all national airspace system users.
