#### § 60102. Purpose and general authority
###### (k) Low-Stress Hazardous Liquid Pipelines.

(1) Minimum standards .

Not later than December 31, 2007 , the Secretary shall issue regulations subjecting low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines to the same standards and regulations as other hazardous liquid pipelines, except as provided in paragraph (3). The implementation of the applicable standards and regulatory requirements may be phased in. The regulations issued under this paragraph shall not apply to gathering lines.

(2) General prohibition against low internal stress exception .

Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Secretary may not provide an exception to the requirements of this chapter for a hazardous liquid pipeline because the pipeline operates at low internal stress.

(3) Limited exceptions .

The Secretary shall provide or continue in force exceptions to this subsection for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that

(A) are subject to safety regulations of the United States Coast Guard; or

(B) serve refining, manufacturing, or truck, rail, or vessel terminal facilities if the pipeline is less than 1 mile long (measured outside the facility grounds) and does not cross an offshore area or a waterway currently used for commercial navigation, until regulations issued under paragraph (1) become effective. After such regulations become effective, the Secretary may retain or remove those exceptions as appropriate.

(4) Relationship to other laws .

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise affect the applicability of any other statutory or regulatory exemption to any hazardous liquid pipeline.

(5) Definition .

For purposes of this subsection, the term “low-stress hazardous liquid pipeline” means a hazardous liquid pipeline that is operated in its entirety at a stress level of 20 percent or less of the specified minimum yield strength of the line pipe.

(6) Effective date .

The requirements of this subsection shall not take effect as to low-stress hazardous liquid pipeline operators before the effective date of the rules promulgated by the Secretary under this subsection.
