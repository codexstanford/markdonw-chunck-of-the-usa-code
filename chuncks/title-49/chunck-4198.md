#### § 47114. Apportionments
###### (c) Amounts Apportioned to Sponsors.

(1) Primary airports.

(A) Apportionment .

The Secretary shall apportion to the sponsor of each primary airport for each fiscal year an amount equal to

(i) $7.80 for each of the first 50,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year;

(ii) $5.20 for each of the next 50,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year;

(iii) $2.60 for each of the next 400,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year;

(iv) $.65 for each of the next 500,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year; and

(v) $.50 for each additional passenger boarding at the airport during the prior calendar year.

(B) Minimum and maximum apportionments .

Not less than $650,000 nor more than $22,000,000 may be apportioned under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to an airport sponsor for a primary airport for each fiscal year.

(C) Special rule .

In any fiscal year in which the total amount made available under section 48103 is $3,200,000,000 or more

(i) the amount to be apportioned to a sponsor under subparagraph (A) shall be increased by doubling the amount that would otherwise be apportioned;

(ii) the minimum apportionment to a sponsor under subparagraph (B) shall be $1,000,000 rather than $650,000; and

(iii) the maximum apportionment to a sponsor under subparagraph (B) shall be $26,000,000 rather than $22,000,000.

(D) New airports .

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall apportion on the first day of the first fiscal year following the official opening of a new airport with scheduled passenger air transportation an amount equal to the minimum amount set forth in subparagraph (B) or (C), as appropriate, to the sponsor of such airport.

(E) Use of previous fiscal year’s apportionment .

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may apportion to an airport sponsor in a fiscal year an amount equal to the amount apportioned to that sponsor in the previous fiscal year if the Secretary finds that

(i) passenger boardings at the airport fell below 10,000 in the calendar year used to calculate the apportionment;

(ii) the airport had at least 10,000 passenger boardings in the calendar year prior to the calendar year used to calculate apportionments to airport sponsors in a fiscal year; and

(iii) the cause of the shortfall in passenger boardings was a temporary but significant interruption in service by an air carrier to that airport due to an employment action, natural disaster, or other event unrelated to the demand for air transportation at the affected airport.

(F) Special rule for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 .

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and subject to subparagraph (G), the Secretary shall apportion to a sponsor of an airport under that subparagraph  1 for each of fiscal years 2018 through 2020 an amount based on the number of passenger boardings at the airport during calendar year 2012 if the airport

(i) had 10,000 or more passenger boardings during calendar year 2012;

(ii) had fewer than 10,000 passenger boardings during the calendar year used to calculate the apportionment for fiscal year 2018, 2019, or 2020, as applicable, under subparagraph (A); and

(iii) had scheduled air service at any point in the calendar year used to calculate the apportionment.

(G) Limitations and waivers .

The authority to make apportionments in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (F) may be utilized no more than 3 years in a row. The Secretary may waive this limitation if the Secretary determines that an airport’s enplanements are substantially close to 10,000 enplanements and the airport sponsor or affected communities are taking reasonable steps to restore enplanements above 10,000.

(H) Minimum apportionment for commercial service airports with more than 8,000 passenger boardings in a calendar year .

Not less than $600,000 may be apportioned under subparagraph (A) for each fiscal year to each sponsor of a commercial service airport that had fewer than 10,000 passenger boardings, but at least 8,000 passenger boardings, during the prior calendar year.

(I) Seasonal airports .

Notwithstanding section 47102, if the Secretary determines that a commercial service airport with at least 8,000 passenger boardings receives scheduled air carrier service for fewer than 6 months in the calendar year used to calculate apportionments to airport sponsors in a fiscal year, then the Secretary shall consider the airport to be a nonhub primary airport for purposes of this chapter.

(J) Special rule for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the absence of scheduled passenger aircraft service at an airport, the Secretary shall apportion in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to the sponsor of the airport an amount based on the number of passenger boardings at the airport during whichever of the following years that would result in the highest apportioned amount:

(i) Calendar year 2018.

(ii) Calendar year 2019.

(iii) The prior full calendar year prior to the current fiscal year.

(2) Cargo airports.

(A) Apportionment .

Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall apportion an amount equal to 3.5 percent of the amount subject to apportionment each fiscal year to the sponsors of airports served by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargo with a total annual landed weight of more than 100,000,000 pounds.

(B) Suballocation formula .

Any funds apportioned under subparagraph (A) to sponsors of airports described in subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among those airports in the proportion that the total annual landed weight of aircraft described in subparagraph (A) landing at each of those airports bears to the total annual landed weight of those aircraft landing at all those airports.

(C) Limitation .

In any fiscal year in which the total amount made available under section 48103 is less than $3,200,000,000, not more than 8 percent of the amount apportioned under subparagraph (A) may be apportioned for any one airport.

(D) Distribution to other airports .

Before apportioning amounts to the sponsors of airports under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year, the Secretary may set-aside a portion of such amounts for distribution to the sponsors of other airports, selected by the Secretary, that the Secretary finds will be served primarily by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargo.

(E) Determination of landed weight .

Landed weight under this paragraph is the landed weight of aircraft landing at each airport described in subparagraph (A) during the prior calendar year.
