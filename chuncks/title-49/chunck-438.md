(1) In general.

(A) Employer notification .

Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Director of the Transportation Security Administration, after receiving comments from interested parties, shall develop and implement a process for notifying hazmat employers designated by an applicant of the results of the applicant’s background record check, if

(B) Relationship to other background records checks.

(i) Elimination of redundant checks .

An individual with respect to whom the Transportation Security Administration

(I) has performed a security threat assessment under this section; and

(II) has issued a final notification of no security threat,  is deemed to have met the requirements of any other background check that is required for purposes of any Federal law applicable to transportation workers if that background check is equivalent to, or less stringent than, the background check required under this section.

(ii) Determination by director .

Not later than 60 days after the date of issuance of the report under paragraph (5), but no later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Director shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding, including notice and opportunity for comment, to determine which background checks required for purposes of Federal laws applicable to transportation workers are equivalent to, or less stringent than, those required under this section.

The Director shall make a determination under the criteria established under clause (ii) with respect to any rulemaking proceeding to establish or modify required background checks for transportation workers initiated after the date of enactment of this subsection.

(2) Appeals process for more stringent state procedures .

If a State establishes its own standards for applicants for a hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver’s license, the State shall also provide

(A) an appeals process similar to and to the same extent as the process provided under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver’s license by that State may appeal that denial; and

(B) a waiver process similar to and to the same extent as the process provided under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver’s license by that State may apply for a waiver.

(3) Clarification of term defined in regulations .

The term “transportation security incident”, as defined in part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, does not include a work stoppage or other nonviolent employee-related action resulting from an employer-employee dispute. Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Director shall modify the definition of that term to reflect the preceding sentence.

(4) Background check capacity .

Not later than October 1, 2005 , the Director shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Homeland Security of the House of Representatives a report on the implementation of fingerprint-based security threat assessments and the adequacy of fingerprinting locations, personnel, and resources to accomplish the timely processing of fingerprint-based security threat assessments for individuals holding commercial driver’s licenses who are applying to renew hazardous materials endorsements.

The report shall

(i) include a list of background checks and other security or threat assessment requirements applicable to transportation workers under Federal laws for which the Department of Homeland Security is responsible and the process by which the Secretary of Homeland Security will determine whether such checks or assessments are equivalent to, or less stringent than, the background check performed under this section; and
