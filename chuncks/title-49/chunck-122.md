###### (c) Goals.

(1) In general .

The goals of ARPA–I shall be

(A) to advance the transportation infrastructure of the United States by developing innovative science and technology solutions that

(i) lower the long-term costs of infrastructure development, including costs of planning, construction, and maintenance;

(ii) reduce the lifecycle impacts of transportation infrastructure on the environment, including through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;

(iii) contribute significantly to improving the safe, secure, and efficient movement of goods and people; and

(iv) promote the resilience of infrastructure from physical and cyber threats; and

(B) to ensure that the United States is a global leader in developing and deploying advanced transportation infrastructure technologies and materials.

(2) Research projects .

ARPA–I shall achieve the goals described in paragraph (1) by providing assistance under this section for infrastructure research projects that

(A) advance novel, early-stage research with practicable application to transportation infrastructure;

(B) translate techniques, processes, and technologies, from the conceptual phase to prototype, testing, or demonstration;

(C) develop advanced manufacturing processes and technologies for the domestic manufacturing of novel transportation-related technologies; and

(D) accelerate transformational technological advances in areas in which industry entities are unlikely to carry out projects due to technical and financial uncertainty.
