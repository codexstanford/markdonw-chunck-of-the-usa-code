###### (m) Preaward and Postdelivery Review of Rolling Stock Purchases .

The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring a preaward and postdelivery review of a grant under this chapter to buy rolling stock to ensure compliance with Government motor vehicle safety requirements, subsection (j) of this section, and bid specifications requirements of grant recipients under this chapter. Under this subsection, independent inspections and review are required, and a manufacturer certification is not sufficient. Rolling stock procurements of 20 vehicles or fewer made for the purpose of serving rural areas and urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or fewer shall be subject to the same requirements as established for procurements of 10 or fewer buses under the post-delivery purchaser’s requirements certification process under section 663.37(c) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.
