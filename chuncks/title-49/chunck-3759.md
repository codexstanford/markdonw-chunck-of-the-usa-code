### CHAPTER 449— SECURITY
#### § 44903. Air transportation security
###### (h) Improved Airport Perimeter Access Security.

(1) In general .

The Administrator, in consultation with the airport operator and law enforcement authorities, may order the deployment of such personnel at any secure area of the airport as necessary to counter the risk of criminal violence, the risk of aircraft piracy at the airport, the risk to air carrier aircraft operations at the airport, or to meet national security concerns.

(2) Security of aircraft and ground access to secure areas .

In determining where to deploy such personnel, the Administrator shall consider the physical security needs of air traffic control facilities, parked aircraft, aircraft servicing equipment, aircraft supplies (including fuel), automobile parking facilities within airport perimeters or adjacent to secured facilities, and access and transition areas at airports served by other means of ground or water transportation.

(3) Deployment of federal law enforcement personnel .

The Secretary of Homeland Security may enter into a memorandum of understanding or other agreement with the Attorney General or the head of any other appropriate Federal law enforcement agency to deploy Federal law enforcement personnel at an airport in order to meet aviation safety and security concerns.

(4) Airport perimeter screening .

The Administrator

(A) shall require screening or inspection of all individuals, goods, property, vehicles, and other equipment before entry into a secured area of an airport in the United States described in section 44903(c);  1

(B) shall prescribe specific requirements for such screening and inspection that will assure at least the same level of protection as will result from screening of passengers and their baggage;

(C) shall establish procedures to ensure the safety and integrity of

(i) all persons providing services with respect to aircraft providing passenger air transportation or intrastate air transportation and facilities of such persons at an airport in the United States described in subsection (c);

(ii) all supplies, including catering and passenger amenities, placed aboard such aircraft, including the sealing of supplies to ensure easy visual detection of tampering; and

(iii) all persons providing such supplies and facilities of such persons;

(D) shall require vendors having direct access to the airfield and aircraft to develop security programs; and

(E) shall issue guidance for the use of biometric or other technology that positively verifies the identity of each employee and law enforcement officer who enters a secure area of an airport.

(5) Use of biometric technology in airport access control systems .

In issuing guidance under paragraph (4)(E), the Administrator in consultation with representatives of the aviation industry, the biometric identifier industry, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall establish, at a minimum

(A) comprehensive technical and operational system requirements and performance standards for the use of biometric identifier technology in airport access control systems (including airport perimeter access control systems) to ensure that the biometric identifier systems are effective, reliable, and secure;

(B) a list of products and vendors that meet the requirements and standards set forth in subparagraph (A);

(C) procedures for implementing biometric identifier systems

(i) to ensure that individuals do not use an assumed identity to enroll in a biometric identifier system; and

(ii) to resolve failures to enroll, false matches, and false non-matches; and

(D) best practices for incorporating biometric identifier technology into airport access control systems in the most effective manner, including a process to best utilize existing airport access control systems, facilities, and equipment and existing data networks connecting airports.

(6) Use of biometric technology for armed law enforcement travel.

(A) In general .

The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall

(i) implement this paragraph by publication in the Federal Register; and

(ii) establish a national registered armed law enforcement program, that shall be federally managed, for law enforcement officers needing to be armed when traveling by commercial aircraft.

(B) Program requirements .

The program shall

(i) establish a credential or a system that incorporates biometric technology and other applicable technologies;

(ii) establish a system for law enforcement officers who need to be armed when traveling by commercial aircraft on a regular basis and for those who need to be armed during temporary travel assignments;

(iii) comply with other uniform credentialing initiatives, including the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12;

(iv) apply to all Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial government law enforcement agencies; and

(v) establish a process by which the travel credential or system may be used to verify the identity, using biometric technology, of a Federal, State, local, tribal, or territorial law enforcement officer seeking to carry a weapon on board a commercial aircraft, without unnecessarily disclosing to the public that the individual is a law enforcement officer.

(C) Procedures .

In establishing the program, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop procedures

(i) to ensure that a law enforcement officer of a Federal, State, local, tribal, or territorial government flying armed has a specific reason for flying armed and the reason is within the scope of the duties of such officer;

(ii) to preserve the anonymity of the armed law enforcement officer;

(iii) to resolve failures to enroll, false matches, and false nonmatches relating to the use of the law enforcement travel credential or system;

(iv) to determine the method of issuance of the biometric credential to law enforcement officers needing to be armed when traveling by commercial aircraft;

(v) to invalidate any law enforcement travel credential or system that is lost, stolen, or no longer authorized for use;

(vi) to coordinate the program with the Federal Air Marshal Service, including the force multiplier program of the Service; and

(vii) to implement a phased approach to launching the program, addressing the immediate needs of the relevant Federal agent population before expanding to other law enforcement populations.

(7) Definitions .

In this subsection, the following definitions apply:

(A) Biometric identifier information .

The term “biometric identifier information” means the distinct physical or behavioral characteristics of an individual that are used for unique identification, or verification of the identity, of an individual.

(B) Biometric identifier .

The term “biometric identifier” means a technology that enables the automated identification, or verification of the identity, of an individual based on biometric information.

(C) Failure to enroll .

The term “failure to enroll” means the inability of an individual to enroll in a biometric identifier system due to an insufficiently distinctive biometric sample, the lack of a body part necessary to provide the biometric sample, a system design that makes it difficult to provide consistent biometric identifier information, or other factors.

(D) False match .

The term “false match” means the incorrect matching of one individual’s biometric identifier information to another individual’s biometric identifier information by a biometric identifier system.

(E) False non-match .

The term “false non-match” means the rejection of a valid identity by a biometric identifier system.

(F) Secure area of an airport .

The term “secure area of an airport” means the sterile area and the Secure Identification Display Area of an airport (as such terms are defined in section 1540.5 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation to such section).
