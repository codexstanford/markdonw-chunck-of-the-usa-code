(II) to improve the safety and productivity of commercial motor vehicles and drivers; and

(III) to reduce costs associated with commercial motor vehicle operations and Federal and State commercial motor vehicle regulatory requirements.

(C) Eligibility .

To be eligible for a grant under this paragraph, a State shall

(i) have a commercial motor vehicle information systems and networks program plan approved by the Secretary that describes the various systems and networks at the State level that need to be refined, revised, upgraded, or built to accomplish deployment of commercial motor vehicle information systems and networks capabilities;

(ii) certify to the Secretary that its commercial motor vehicle information systems and networks deployment activities, including hardware procurement, software and system development, and infrastructure modifications

(I) are consistent with the national intelligent transportation systems and commercial motor vehicle information systems and networks architectures and available standards; and

(II) promote interoperability and efficiency to the extent practicable; and

(iii) agree to execute interoperability tests developed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to verify that its systems conform with the national intelligent transportation systems architecture, applicable standards, and protocols for commercial motor vehicle information systems and networks.
