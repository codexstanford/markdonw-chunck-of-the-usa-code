###### (s) Agreements Granting Through-The-Fence Access to General Aviation Airports.

(1) In general .

Subject to paragraph (2), a sponsor of a general aviation airport shall not be considered to be in violation of this subtitle, or to be in violation of a grant assurance made under this section or under any other provision of law as a condition for the receipt of Federal financial assistance for airport development, solely because the sponsor enters into an agreement that grants to a person that owns residential real property adjacent to or near the airport access to the airfield of the airport for the following:

(A) Aircraft of the person.

(B) Aircraft authorized by the person.

(2) Through-the-fence agreements.

(A) In general .

An agreement described in paragraph (1) between an airport sponsor and a property owner (or an association representing such property owner) shall be a written agreement that prescribes the rights, responsibilities, charges, duration, and other terms the airport sponsor determines are necessary to establish and manage the airport sponsor’s relationship with the property owner.

(B) Terms and conditions .

An agreement described in paragraph (1) between an airport sponsor and a property owner (or an association representing such property owner) shall require the property owner, at minimum

(i) to pay airport access charges that, as determined by the airport sponsor, are comparable to those charged to tenants and operators on-airport making similar use of the airport;

(ii) to bear the cost of building and maintaining the infrastructure that, as determined by the airport sponsor, is necessary to provide aircraft located on the property adjacent to or near the airport access to the airfield of the airport;

(iii) to maintain the property for residential, noncommercial use for the duration of the agreement;

(iv) to prohibit access to the airport from other properties through the property of the property owner; and

(v) to prohibit any aircraft refueling from occurring on the property.

(3) Exemption .

The terms and conditions of paragraph (2) shall not apply to an agreement described in paragraph (1) made before the enactment of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ( Public Law 112–95 ) that the Secretary determines does not comply with such terms and conditions but involves property that is subject to deed or lease restrictions that are considered perpetual and that cannot readily be brought into compliance. However, if the Secretary determines that the airport sponsor and residential property owners are able to make any modification to such an agreement on or after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the exemption provided by this paragraph shall no longer apply.
