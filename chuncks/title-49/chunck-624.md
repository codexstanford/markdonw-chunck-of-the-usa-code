(A) Entrance into project development phase .

A new small starts project shall enter into the project development phase when

(i) the applicant

(I) submits a letter to the Secretary describing the project and requesting entry into the project development phase; and

(II) initiates activities required to be carried out under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) with respect to the project; and

(I) responds in writing to the applicant within 45 days whether the information provided is sufficient to enter into the project development phase, including, when necessary, a detailed description of any information deemed insufficient; and

(II) provides concurrent notice to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives of whether the small starts project is entering the project development phase.

(B) Activities during project development phase .

Concurrent with the analysis required to be made under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), each applicant shall develop sufficient information to enable the Secretary to make findings of project justification, policies and land use patterns that promote public transportation, and local financial commitment under this subsection.

(3) Selection criteria .

The Secretary may provide Federal assistance for a small start project under this subsection only if the Secretary determines that the project

(B) is based on the results of an analysis of the benefits of the project as set forth in paragraph (4); and

(C) is supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment.

(4) Evaluation of benefits and federal investment .

In making a determination for a small start project under paragraph (3)(B), the Secretary shall analyze, evaluate, and consider the following evaluation criteria for the project (as compared to a no-action alternative): mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects associated with the project, policies and land use patterns that support public transportation and cost-effectiveness as measured by cost per rider.

(5) Evaluation of local financial commitment .

For purposes of paragraph (3)(C), the Secretary shall require that each proposed local source of capital and operating financing is stable, reliable, and available within the proposed project timetable.

(6) Ratings .

(A) In general .

In carrying out paragraphs (4) and (5) for a small start project, the Secretary shall evaluate and rate the project on a 5-point scale (high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, or low) based on an evaluation of the benefits of the project as compared to the Federal assistance to be provided and the degree of local financial commitment, as required under this subsection. In rating the projects, the Secretary shall provide, in addition to the overall project rating, individual ratings for each of the criteria established by this subsection and shall give comparable, but not necessarily equal, numerical weight to the benefits that the project will bring to the community in calculating the overall project rating.

(B) Optional early rating .

At the request of the project sponsor, the Secretary shall evaluate and rate the project in accordance with paragraphs (4) and (5) and subparagraph (A) of this paragraph upon completion of the analysis required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
