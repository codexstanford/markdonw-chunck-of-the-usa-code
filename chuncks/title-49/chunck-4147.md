###### (i) Relief From Obligation To Provide Free Space .

When a sponsor provides a property interest in a land or water area or a building that the Secretary of Transportation uses to construct a facility at Government expense, the Secretary may relieve the sponsor from an obligation in a contract made under this chapter, the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, or the Federal Airport Act to provide free space to the Government in an airport building, to the extent the Secretary finds that the free space no longer is needed to carry out activities related to air traffic control or navigation.
