(B) may make the voluntary and binding arbitration process available only

(i) after receiving the written consent to arbitrate from all relevant parties; and

(ii)

(I) after the filing of a written complaint; or

(II) through other procedures adopted by the Board in a rulemaking proceeding;

(C) with respect to rate disputes, may make the voluntary and binding arbitration process available only to the relevant parties if the rail carrier has market dominance (as determined under section 10707); and

(D) may initiate the voluntary and binding arbitration process not later than 40 days after the date on which a written complaint is filed or through other procedures adopted by the Board in a rulemaking proceeding.

(2) Limitation .

Initiation of the voluntary and binding arbitration process shall preclude the Board from separately reviewing a complaint or dispute related to the same rail rate or practice in a covered dispute involving the same parties.

(3) Rates .

In resolving a covered dispute involving the reasonableness of a rail carrier’s rates, the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, as applicable, shall consider the Board’s methodologies for setting maximum lawful rates, giving due consideration to the need for differential pricing to permit a rail carrier to collect adequate revenues (as determined under section 10704(a)(2)).
