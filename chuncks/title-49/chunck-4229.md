#### § 47118. Designating current and former military airports
###### (c) Considerations .

In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consider only current or former military airports for designation under this section if a grant under section 47117(e)(1)(B) would

(1) reduce delays at an airport with more than 20,000 hours of annual delays in commercial passenger aircraft takeoffs and landings;

(2) enhance airport and air traffic control system capacity in a metropolitan area or reduce current and projected flight delays; or

(3) preserve or enhance minimum airfield infrastructure facilities at former military airports to support emergency diversionary operations for transoceanic flights in locations

(A) within United States jurisdiction or control; and

(B) where there is a demonstrable lack of diversionary airports within the distance or flight-time required by regulations governing transoceanic flights.
