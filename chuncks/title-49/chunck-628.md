###### (l) Government Share of Net Capital Project Cost.

(1) In general.

(A) Estimation of net capital project cost .

Based on engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary shall estimate the net capital project cost.

(B) Grants.

(i) Grant for new fixed guideway capital project .

A grant for a new fixed guideway capital project shall not exceed 80 percent of the net capital project cost.

(ii) Full funding grant agreement for new fixed guideway capital project .

A full funding grant agreement for a new fixed guideway capital project shall not include a share of more than 60 percent from the funds made available under this section.

(iii) Grant for core capacity improvement project .

A grant for a core capacity improvement project shall not exceed 80 percent of the net capital project cost of the incremental cost to increase the capacity in the corridor.

(iv) Grant for small start project .

A grant for a small start project shall not exceed 80 percent of the net capital project costs.

(2) Adjustment for completion under budget .

The Secretary may adjust the final net capital project cost of a new fixed guideway capital project or core capacity improvement project evaluated under subsection (d), (e), or (i) to include the cost of eligible activities not included in the originally defined project if the Secretary determines that the originally defined project has been completed at a cost that is significantly below the original estimate.

(3) Maximum government share .

The Secretary may provide a higher grant percentage than requested by the grant recipient if

(A) the Secretary determines that the net capital project cost of the project is not more than 10 percent higher than the net capital project cost estimated at the time the project was approved for advancement into the engineering phase; and

(B) the ridership estimated for the project is not less than 90 percent of the ridership estimated for the project at the time the project was approved for advancement into the engineering phase.

(4) Remaining costs .

The remainder of the net capital project costs shall be provided

(A) in cash from non-Government sources;

(B) from revenues from the sale of advertising and concessions; or

(C) from an undistributed cash surplus, a replacement or depreciation cash fund or reserve, or new capital.

(5) Limitation on statutory construction .

Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to require a non-Federal financial commitment for a project that is more than 20 percent of the net capital project cost.

(6) Special rule for rolling stock costs .

In addition to amounts allowed pursuant to paragraph (1), a planned extension to a fixed guideway system may include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if the applicant satisfies the Secretary that only amounts other than amounts provided by the Government were used and that the purchase was made for use on the extension. A refund or reduction of the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of the Government is made at the same time.

(7) Limitation on applicability .

This subsection shall not apply to projects for which the Secretary entered into a full funding grant agreement before the date of enactment of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012.

(8) Special rule for fixed guideway bus rapid transit projects .

For up to three fixed-guideway bus rapid transit projects each fiscal year the Secretary shall

(A) establish a Government share of at least 80 percent; and

(B) not lower the project’s rating for degree of local financial commitment for purposes of subsections (d)(2)(A)(v) or (h)(3)(C) as a result of the Government share specified in this paragraph.
