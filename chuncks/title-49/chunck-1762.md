#### § 22402. Direct loans and loan guarantees
###### (h) Conditions of Assistance.

(1) The Secretary shall, before granting assistance under this section, require the applicant to agree to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended

(A) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or intermodal operations for purposes not related to such operations, if such use would impair the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to provide rail or intermodal services in an efficient and economic manner, or would adversely affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to perform any obligation entered into by the applicant under this section;

(B) will, consistent with its capital resources, maintain its capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis; and

(C) will not make any discretionary dividend payments that unreasonably conflict with the purposes stated in subsection (b).

(2) The Secretary shall not require an applicant for a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section to provide collateral. Any collateral provided or thereafter enhanced shall be valued as a going concern after giving effect to the present value of improvements contemplated by the completion and operation of the project, if applicable. The Secretary shall not require that an applicant for a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section have previously sought the financial assistance requested from another source.

(3) The Secretary shall require recipients of direct loans or loan guarantees under this section to comply with

(A) the standards of section 24312, as in effect on September 1, 2002 , with respect to the project in the same manner that Amtrak is required to comply with such standards for construction work financed under an agreement made under section 24308(a); and

(B) the protective arrangements established under section 22404, with respect to employees affected by actions taken in connection with the project to be financed by the loan or loan guarantee.

(4) The Secretary shall require each recipient of a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section for a project described in subsection (b)(1)(F) to provide a non-Federal match of not less than 25 percent of the total amount expended by the recipient for such project.
