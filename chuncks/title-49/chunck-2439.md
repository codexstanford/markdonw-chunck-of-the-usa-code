#### § 31137. Electronic logging devices and brake maintenance regulations
###### (d) Additional Considerations .

The Secretary, in prescribing the regulations described in subsection (a), shall consider how such regulations may

(1) reduce or eliminate requirements for drivers and motor carriers to retain supporting documentation associated with paper-based records of duty status if

(A) data contained in an electronic logging device supplants such documentation; and

(B) using such data without paper-based records does not diminish the Secretary’s ability to audit and review compliance with the Secretary’s hours of service regulations; and

(2) include such measures as the Secretary determines are necessary to protect the privacy of each individual whose personal data is contained in an electronic logging device.
