###### (b) Based on Fixed Guideway Vehicle Revenue Miles, Directional Route Miles, and Passenger Miles .

(1) In this subsection, “fixed guideway vehicle revenue miles” and “fixed guideway directional route miles” include passenger ferry operations directly or under contract by the designated recipient.

(2) Of the amount apportioned under subsection (a)(2) of this section, 33.29 percent shall be apportioned as follows:

(A) 95.61 percent of the total amount apportioned under this subsection shall be apportioned so that each urbanized area with a population of at least 200,000 is entitled to receive an amount equal to

(i) 60 percent of the 95.61 percent apportioned under this subparagraph multiplied by a ratio equal to the number of fixed guideway vehicle revenue miles attributable to the area, as established by the Secretary, divided by the total number of all fixed guideway vehicle revenue miles attributable to all areas; and

(ii) 40 percent of the 95.61 percent apportioned under this subparagraph multiplied by a ratio equal to the number of fixed guideway directional route miles attributable to the area, established by the Secretary, divided by the total number of all fixed guideway directional route miles attributable to all areas. An urbanized area with a population of at least 750,000 in which commuter rail transportation is provided shall receive at least .75 percent of the total amount apportioned under this subparagraph.

(B) 4.39 percent of the total amount apportioned under this subsection shall be apportioned so that each urbanized area with a population of at least 200,000 is entitled to receive an amount equal to

(i) the number of fixed guideway vehicle passenger miles traveled multiplied by the number of fixed guideway vehicle passenger miles traveled for each dollar of operating cost in an area; divided by

(ii) the total number of fixed guideway vehicle passenger miles traveled multiplied by the total number of fixed guideway vehicle passenger miles traveled for each dollar of operating cost in all areas. An urbanized area with a population of at least 750,000 in which commuter rail transportation is provided shall receive at least .75 percent of the total amount apportioned under this subparagraph.

(C) Under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, fixed guideway vehicle revenue or directional route miles, and passengers served on those miles, in an urbanized area with a population of less than 200,000, where the miles and passengers served otherwise would be attributable to an urbanized area with a population of at least 1,000,000 in an adjacent State, are attributable to the governmental authority in the State in which the urbanized area with a population of less than 200,000 is located. The authority is deemed an urbanized area with a population of at least 200,000 if the authority makes a contract for the service.

(D) A recipient’s apportionment under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph may not be reduced if the recipient, after satisfying the Secretary that energy or operating efficiencies would be achieved, reduces vehicle revenue miles but provides the same frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders.

(E) For purposes of subparagraph (A) and section 5337(c)(3), the Secretary shall deem to be attributable to an urbanized area not less than 27 percent of the fixed guideway vehicle revenue miles or fixed guideway directional route miles in the public transportation system of a recipient that are located outside the urbanized area for which the recipient receives funds, in addition to the fixed guideway vehicle revenue miles or fixed guideway directional route miles of the recipient that are located inside the urbanized area.
