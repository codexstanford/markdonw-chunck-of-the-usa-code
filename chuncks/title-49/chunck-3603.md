#### § 44726. Denial and revocation of certificate for counterfeit parts violations
###### (g) Amendment of Certificate .

If the holder of a certificate issued under this chapter is other than an individual and the Administrator finds that

(1) an individual who had a controlling or ownership interest in the holder committed a violation of a law for the violation of which a certificate may be revoked under this section or knowingly, and with intent to defraud, carried out or facilitated an activity punishable under such a law; and

(2) the holder satisfies the requirements for the certificate without regard to that individual, then the Administrator may amend the certificate to impose a limitation that the certificate will not be valid if that individual has a controlling or ownership interest in the holder. A decision by the Administrator under this subsection is not reviewable by the Board.
