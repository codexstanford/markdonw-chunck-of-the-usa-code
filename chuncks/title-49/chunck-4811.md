### CHAPTER 801— BILLS OF LADING
#### § 80105. Title and rights affected by negotiation
###### (b) Superiority of Rights .

When a negotiable bill of lading is negotiated to a person for value in good faith, that person’s right to the goods for which the bill was issued is superior to a seller’s lien or to a right to stop the transportation of the goods. This subsection applies whether the negotiation is made before or after the common carrier issuing the bill receives notice of the seller’s claim. The carrier may deliver the goods to an unpaid seller only if the bill first is surrendered for cancellation.
