(1) Letters of intent.

(A) Amounts intended to be obligated .

The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to an applicant announcing an intention to obligate, for a new fixed guideway capital project or core capacity improvement project, an amount from future available budget authority specified in law that is not more than the amount stipulated as the financial participation of the Secretary in the project. When a letter is issued for a capital project under this section, the amount shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.

(B) Treatment .

The issuance of a letter under subparagraph (A) is deemed not to be an obligation under sections 1108(c), 1501, and 1502(a) of title 31 or an administrative commitment.

(2) Full funding grant agreements.

(A) In general .

A new fixed guideway capital project or core capacity improvement project shall be carried out through a full funding grant agreement.

(B) Criteria .

The Secretary shall enter into a full funding grant agreement, based on the evaluations and ratings required under subsection (d), (e), or (i), as applicable, with each grantee receiving assistance for a new fixed guideway capital project or core capacity improvement project that has been rated as high, medium-high, or medium, in accordance with subsection (g)(2)(A) or (i)(3)(B), as applicable.

(iv) make timely and efficient management of the project easier according to the law of the United States.

(D) Special financial rules.

(i) In general .

A full funding grant agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment, contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an additional amount from future available budget authority specified in law.

(ii) Statement of contingent commitment .

The agreement shall state that the contingent commitment is not an obligation of the Government.

Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a full funding grant agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms.

(iv) Completion of operable segment .

The amount stipulated in an agreement under this paragraph for a new fixed guideway capital project shall be sufficient to complete at least an operable segment.

(E) Information collection and analysis plan.

(F) Collection of data on current system .

To be eligible for a full funding grant agreement under this paragraph, recipients shall have collected data on the current system, according to the plan required under subparagraph (E)(ii), before the beginning of construction of the proposed new fixed guideway capital project or core capacity improvement project. Collection of this data shall be included in the full funding grant agreement as an eligible activity.

(3) Early systems work agreements.
