#### § 32903. Credits for exceeding average fuel economy standards
###### (b) Period of Availability and Plan for Future Credits .
######## (A) Before the end of a model year, if a manufacturer has reason to believe that its average fuel economy for passenger automobiles will be less than the applicable standard for that model year, the manufacturer may submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation demonstrating that the manufacturer will earn sufficient credits under this section within the next 3 model years to allow the manufacturer to meet that standard for the model year involved. Unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer is unlikely to earn sufficient credits under the plan, the Secretary shall approve the plan. Those credits are available for the model year involved if

(i) the Secretary approves the plan; and

(ii) the manufacturer earns those credits as provided by the plan.

(B) If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer is less than the applicable standard under subsections (a) through (d) of section 32902 after applying credits under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the manufacturer and give the manufacturer a reasonable time (of at least 60 days) to submit a plan.
