(C) shall be entitled to return of the slot by the Secretary if use of the exemption made available to the carrier under paragraph (1) is discontinued;

(D) shall have sole discretion concerning the use of an exemption made available under paragraph (1), including the initial or any subsequent beyond perimeter destinations to be served; and
