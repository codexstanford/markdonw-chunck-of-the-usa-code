###### (k) Plan Monitoring.

(1) In general .

On the basis of reports submitted by the lead State agency responsible for administering a State plan approved under this section and an investigation by the Secretary, the Secretary shall periodically evaluate State implementation of and compliance with the State plan.

(2) Withholding of funds.

(A) Disapproval .

If, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, the Secretary finds that a State plan previously approved under this section is not being followed or has become inadequate to ensure enforcement of State regulations, standards, or orders described in subsection (c)(1), or the State is otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of this section, the Secretary may withdraw approval of the State plan and notify the State. Upon the receipt of such notice, the State plan shall no longer be in effect and the Secretary shall withhold all funding to the State under this section.

(B) Noncompliance withholding .

In lieu of withdrawing approval of a State plan under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may, after providing notice to the State and an opportunity to be heard, withhold funding from the State to which the State would otherwise be entitled under this section for the period of the State’s noncompliance. In exercising this option, the Secretary may withhold

(i) up to 5 percent of funds during the fiscal year that the Secretary notifies the State of its noncompliance;

(ii) up to 10 percent of funds for the first full fiscal year of noncompliance;

(iii) up to 25 percent of funds for the second full fiscal year of noncompliance; and

(iv) not more than 50 percent of funds for the third and any subsequent full fiscal year of noncompliance.

(3) Judicial review .

A State adversely affected by a determination under paragraph (2) may seek judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5. Notwithstanding the disapproval of a State plan under paragraph (2)(A) or the withholding of funds under paragraph (2)(B), the State may retain jurisdiction in an administrative or a judicial proceeding that commenced before the notice of disapproval or withholding if the issues involved are not related directly to the reasons for the disapproval or withholding.
