#### § 47111. Payments under project grant agreements
###### (b) Recovering Payments .

If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government’s share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.
