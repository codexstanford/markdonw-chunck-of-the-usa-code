#### § 20153. Audible warnings at highway-rail grade crossings
###### (a) Definitions .

As used in this section

(1) the term “highway-rail grade crossing” includes any street or highway crossing over a line of railroad at grade;

(2) the term “locomotive horn” refers to a train-borne audible warning device meeting standards specified by the Secretary of Transportation; and

(3) the term “supplementary safety measure” refers to a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this subsection: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.
