(B) Adjustment of price .

The Administrator shall adjust the price of an aeronautical product and service sold to the public as necessary to avoid any adverse impact on aviation safety attributable to the price specified under this paragraph.

(C) Costs attributable to acquisition of aeronautical data .

A price established under this paragraph may not include costs attributable to the acquisition of aeronautical data.

(D) Continuation of prices .

The price of any product created under subsection (d) may correspond to the price of a comparable product produced by a department of the United States Government as that price was in effect on September 30, 2000 , and may remain in effect until modified by regulation under section 9701 of title 31 , United States Code.

(2) Publication of prices .

The Administrator shall publish annually the prices at which aeronautical products are sold to the public.

(B) at prices the Administrator establishes, to the departments and officers of the United States requiring them for official use; and
