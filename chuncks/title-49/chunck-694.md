#### § 5323. General provisions
###### (r) Reasonable Access to Public Transportation Facilities .

A recipient of assistance under this chapter may not deny reasonable access for a private intercity or charter transportation operator to federally funded public transportation facilities, including intermodal facilities, park and ride lots, and bus-only highway lanes. In determining reasonable access, capacity requirements of the recipient of assistance and the extent to which access would be detrimental to existing public transportation services must be considered.
