The metropolitan planning organization shall prepare and update such plan every 4 years (or more frequently, if the metropolitan planning organization elects to update more frequently) in the case of each of the following:

(I) Any area designated as nonattainment, as defined in section 107(d) of the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7407(d) ).

(II) Any area that was nonattainment and subsequently designated to attainment in accordance with section 107(d)(3) of that Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(3) ) and that is subject to a maintenance plan under section 175A of that Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7505a ).

(ii) Other areas .

In the case of any other area required to have a transportation plan in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, the metropolitan planning organization shall prepare and update such plan every 5 years unless the metropolitan planning organization elects to update more frequently.

(2) Transportation plan .

A transportation plan under this section shall be in a form that the Secretary determines to be appropriate and shall contain, at a minimum, the following:

(A) Identification of transportation facilities.

(i) In general .

An identification of transportation facilities (including major roadways, public transportation facilities, intercity bus facilities, multimodal and intermodal facilities, nonmotorized transportation facilities, and intermodal connectors) that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving emphasis to those facilities that serve important national and regional transportation functions.

(ii) Factors .

In formulating the transportation plan, the metropolitan planning organization shall consider factors described in subsection (h) as the factors relate to a 20-year forecast period.

(B) Performance measures and targets .

A description of the performance measures and performance targets used in assessing the performance of the transportation system in accordance with subsection (h)(2).

(C) System performance report .

A system performance report and subsequent updates evaluating the condition and performance of the transportation system with respect to the performance targets described in subsection (h)(2), including

(i) progress achieved by the metropolitan planning organization in meeting the performance targets in comparison with system performance recorded in previous reports; and

(ii) for metropolitan planning organizations that voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios, an analysis of how the preferred scenario has improved the conditions and performance of the transportation system and how changes in local policies and investments have impacted the costs necessary to achieve the identified performance targets.

(D) Mitigation activities.

(i) In general .

A long-range transportation plan shall include a discussion of types of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the plan.

(ii) Consultation .

The discussion shall be developed in consultation with Federal, State, and tribal wildlife, land management, and regulatory agencies.

(E) Financial plan.

(i) In general .

A financial plan that

(I) demonstrates how the adopted transportation plan can be implemented;

(II) indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the plan; and

(III) recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs.

(ii) Inclusions .

The financial plan may include, for illustrative purposes, additional projects that would be included in the adopted transportation plan if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were available.

(iii) Cooperative development .

For the purpose of developing the transportation plan, the metropolitan planning organization, transit operator, and State shall cooperatively develop estimates of funds that will be available to support plan implementation.

(F) Operational and management strategies .

Operational and management strategies to improve the performance of existing transportation facilities to relieve vehicular congestion and maximize the safety and mobility of people and goods.

(G) Capital investment and other strategies .

Capital investment and other strategies to preserve the existing and projected future metropolitan transportation infrastructure, provide for multimodal capacity increases based on regional priorities and needs, and reduce the vulnerability of the existing transportation infrastructure to natural disasters.

(H) Transportation and transit enhancement activities .

Proposed transportation and transit enhancement activities, including consideration of the role that intercity buses may play in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption in a cost-effective manner and strategies and investments that preserve and enhance intercity bus systems, including systems that are privately owned and operated.

(3) Coordination with clean air act agencies .

In metropolitan areas that are in nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the metropolitan planning organization shall coordinate the development of a transportation plan with the process for development of the transportation control measures of the State implementation plan required by that Act.

(4) Optional scenario development.

(A) In general .

A metropolitan planning organization may, while fitting the needs and complexity of its community, voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios for consideration as part of the development of the metropolitan transportation plan, in accordance with subparagraph (B).

(B) Recommended components .

A metropolitan planning organization that chooses to develop multiple scenarios under subparagraph (A) shall be encouraged to consider

(i) potential regional investment strategies for the planning horizon;

(ii) assumed distribution of population and employment;

(iii) assumed distribution of population and housing;

(iv) a scenario that, to the maximum extent practicable, maintains baseline conditions for the performance measures identified in subsection (h)(2);

(v) a scenario that improves the baseline conditions for as many of the performance measures identified in subsection (h)(2) as possible;

(vi) revenue constrained scenarios based on the total revenues expected to be available over the forecast period of the plan; and

(vii) estimated costs and potential revenues available to support each scenario.

(C) Metrics .

In addition to the performance measures identified in section 150(c) of title 23 , metropolitan planning organizations may evaluate scenarios developed under this paragraph using locally-developed measures.

(5) Consultation.

(A) In general .

In each metropolitan area, the metropolitan planning organization shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation concerning the development of a long-range transportation plan.

(B) Issues .

The consultation shall involve, as appropriate

(i) comparison of transportation plans with State conservation plans or maps, if available; or

(ii) comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.

(6) Participation by interested parties.

(A) In general .

Each metropolitan planning organization shall provide citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, public ports, freight shippers, providers of freight transportation services, private providers of transportation (including intercity bus operators, employer-based commuting programs, such as a carpool program, vanpool program, transit benefit program, parking cash-out program, shuttle program, or telework program), representatives of users of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, affordable housing organizations, and other interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the transportation plan.
