(2) Factors to consider .

(A) whether the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder or party other than that legally on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, at the time of the movement for the transportation service;

(B) whether the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;

(C) whether the carrier or freight forwarder did not properly or timely file with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board, as required, a tariff providing for such transportation rate or failed to enter into an agreement for contract carriage;

(D) whether the transportation rate was billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder; and

(E) whether the carrier or freight forwarder or party demands additional payment of a higher rate filed in a tariff.
