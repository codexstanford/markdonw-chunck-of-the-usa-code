#### § 47107. Project grant application approval conditioned on assurances about airport operations
###### (e) Written Assurances of Opportunities for Small Business Concerns .

(1) The Secretary of Transportation may approve a project grant application under this subchapter for an airport development project only if the Secretary receives written assurances, satisfactory to the Secretary, that the airport owner or operator will take necessary action to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that at least 10 percent of all businesses at the airport selling consumer products or providing consumer services to the public are small business concerns (as defined by regulations of the Secretary) owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual (as defined in section 47113(a) of this title ) or qualified HUBZone small business concerns (as defined in section 31(b) of the Small Business Act).

(2) An airport owner or operator may meet the percentage goal of paragraph (1) of this subsection by including any business operated through a management contract or subcontract. The dollar amount of a management contract or subcontract with a disadvantaged business enterprise shall be added to the total participation by disadvantaged business enterprises in airport concessions and to the base from which the airport’s percentage goal is calculated. The dollar amount of a management contract or subcontract with a non-disadvantaged business enterprise and the gross revenue of business activities to which the management contract or subcontract pertains may not be added to this base.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, an airport owner or operator may meet the percentage goal of paragraph (1) of this subsection by including the purchase from disadvantaged business enterprises of goods and services used in businesses conducted at the airport, but the owner or operator and the businesses conducted at the airport shall make good faith efforts to explore all available options to achieve, to the maximum extent practicable, compliance with the goal through direct ownership arrangements, including joint ventures and franchises.

(4)

(A) In complying with paragraph (1) of this subsection, an airport owner or operator shall include the revenues of car rental firms at the airport in the base from which the percentage goal in paragraph (1) is calculated.

(B) An airport owner or operator may require a car rental firm to meet a requirement under paragraph (1) of this subsection by purchasing or leasing goods or services from a disadvantaged business enterprise. If an owner or operator requires such a purchase or lease, a car rental firm shall be permitted to meet the requirement by including purchases or leases of vehicles from any vendor that qualifies as a small business concern owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual or as a qualified HUBZone small business concern (as defined in section 31(b) of the Small Business Act).

(C) This subsection does not require a car rental firm to change its corporate structure to provide for direct ownership arrangements to meet the requirements of this subsection.

(5) This subsection does not preempt

(A) a State or local law, regulation, or policy enacted by the governing body of an airport owner or operator; or

(B) the authority of a State or local government or airport owner or operator to adopt or enforce a law, regulation, or policy related to disadvantaged business enterprises.

(6) An airport owner or operator may provide opportunities for a small business concern owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual or a qualified HUBZone small business concern (as defined in section 31(b) of the Small Business Act) to participate through direct contractual agreement with that concern.

(7) An air carrier that provides passenger or property-carrying services or another business that conducts aeronautical activities at an airport may not be included in the percentage goal of paragraph (1) of this subsection for participation of small business concerns at the airport.

(8) Not later than April 29, 1993 , the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subsection.
