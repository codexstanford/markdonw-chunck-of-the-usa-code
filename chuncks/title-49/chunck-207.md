(3) amounts received from the sale or exchange of property; and

(4) payments received for loss or damage to property of the fund.

(d) The fund shall be reimbursed, in advance, from amounts available to the Department or from other sources, for supplies and services at rates that will approximate the expenses of operation, including the accrual of annual leave and the depreciation of equipment.
