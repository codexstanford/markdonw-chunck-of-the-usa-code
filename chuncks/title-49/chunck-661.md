###### (h) Low or No Emission Vehicle Component Assessment.

(1) Definitions .

In this subsection

(A) the term “covered institution of higher education” means an institution of higher education with which the Secretary enters into a contract or cooperative agreement, or to which the Secretary makes a grant, under paragraph (2)(B) to operate a facility selected under paragraph (2)(A);

(B) the terms “direct carbon emissions” and “low or no emission vehicle” have the meanings given those terms in subsection (e)(6);

(C) the term “institution of higher education” has the meaning given the term in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1002 ); and

(D) the term “low or no emission vehicle component” means an item that is separately installed in and removable from a low or no emission vehicle.

(2) Assessing low or no emission vehicle components.

(A) In general .

The Secretary shall competitively select at least 1 facility

(i) to conduct testing, evaluation, and analysis of low or no emission vehicle components intended for use in low or no emission vehicles; and

(ii) to conduct directed technology research.

(B) Testing, evaluation, and analysis.

(i) In general .

The Secretary shall enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with, or make a grant to, at least 1 institution of higher education to operate and maintain a facility to conduct testing, evaluation, and analysis of low or no emission vehicle components, and new and emerging technology components, intended for use in low or no emission vehicles.

(ii) Requirements .

An institution of higher education described in clause (i) shall have

(I) capacity to carry out transportation-related advanced component and vehicle evaluation;

(II) laboratories capable of testing and evaluation; and

(III) direct access to or a partnership with a testing facility capable of emulating real-world circumstances in order to test low or no emission vehicle components installed on the intended vehicle.

(C) Fees .

A covered institution of higher education shall establish and collect fees, which shall be approved by the Secretary, for the assessment of low or no emission vehicle components at the applicable facility selected under subparagraph (A).

(D) Availability of amounts to pay for assessment .

The Secretary shall enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with, or make a grant to an institution of higher education under which

(i) the Secretary shall pay 50 percent of the cost of assessing a low or no emission vehicle component at the applicable facility selected under subparagraph (A) from amounts made available to carry out this section; and

(ii) the remaining 50 percent of such cost shall be paid from amounts recovered through the fees established and collected pursuant to subparagraph (C).

(E) Voluntary testing .

A manufacturer of a low or no emission vehicle component is not required to assess the low or no emission vehicle component at a facility selected under subparagraph (A).

(F) Compliance with section 5318 .

Notwithstanding whether a low or no emission vehicle component is assessed at a facility selected under subparagraph (A), each new bus model shall comply with the requirements under section 5318.

(G) Separate facility .

A facility selected under subparagraph (A) shall be separate and distinct from the facility operated and maintained under section 5318.

(H) Capital equipment and directed research .

A facility operated and maintained under subparagraph (A) may use funds made available under this subsection for

(i) acquisition of equipment and capital projects related to testing low or no emission vehicle components; or

(ii) research related to advanced vehicle technologies that provides advancements to the entire public transportation industry.

(I) Cost share .

The cost share for activities described in subparagraph (H) shall be subject to the terms in subsection (g).

(3) Low or no emission vehicle component performance reports .

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2015, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall issue a report on low or no emission vehicle component assessments conducted at each facility selected under paragraph (2)(A), which shall include information related to the maintainability, reliability, performance, structural integrity, efficiency, and noise of those low or no emission vehicle components, as applicable.

(4) Public availability of assessments .

Each assessment conducted at a facility selected under paragraph (2)(A) shall be made publicly available, including to affected industries.

(5) Rule of construction .

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require

(A) a low or no emission vehicle component to be tested at a facility selected under paragraph (2)(A); or

(B) the development or disclosure of a privately funded component assessment.
