Except as provided under paragraphs (2) and (3) and in accordance with section 5107 of the FAST Act, a State plan under subsection (c) shall provide that the total expenditure of amounts of the lead State commercial motor vehicle safety agency responsible for administering the plan will be maintained at a level each fiscal year that is at least equal to

At the request of a State, the Secretary may evaluate additional documentation related to the maintenance of effort and may make reasonable adjustments to the maintenance of effort baseline after the year in which the Secretary implements a new allocation formula under section 5106 of the FAST Act, and this adjusted baseline will replace the maintenance of effort requirement under paragraph (1).

(3) Waivers .

At the request of a State, the Secretary may waive or modify the requirements of this subsection for a total of 1 fiscal year if the Secretary determines that the waiver or modification is reasonable, based on circumstances described by the State, to ensure the continuation of commercial motor vehicle enforcement activities in the State.
