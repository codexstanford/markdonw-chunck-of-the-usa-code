#### § 24903. General authority
###### (c) Compensation for Transportation Over Certain Rights of Way and Facilities .

(1) An agreement under subsection (a)(6) of this section shall provide for reasonable reimbursement of costs but may not cross-subsidize intercity rail passenger, commuter rail passenger, and rail freight transportation.

(2) If the parties do not agree, the Surface Transportation Board shall order that the transportation continue over facilities acquired under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 ( 45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 ( 45 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), and chapter 224 of this title and shall determine compensation (without allowing cross-subsidization between commuter rail passenger and intercity rail passenger and rail freight transportation) for the transportation not later than 120 days after the dispute is submitted. The Board shall assign to a rail carrier obtaining transportation under this subsection the costs Amtrak incurs only for the benefit of the carrier, plus a proportionate share of all other costs of providing transportation under this paragraph incurred for the common benefit of Amtrak and the carrier. The proportionate share shall be based on relative measures of volume of car operations, tonnage, or other factors that reasonably reflect the relative use of rail property covered by this subsection.

(3) This subsection does not prevent the parties from making an agreement under subsection (a)(6) of this section after the Board makes a decision under this subsection.
