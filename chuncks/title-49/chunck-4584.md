###### (e) Distribution Integrity Management Programs.

(1) Minimum standards .

Not later than December 31, 2007 , the Secretary shall prescribe minimum standards for integrity management programs for distribution pipelines.

(2) Additional authority of secretary .

In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary may require operators of distribution pipelines to continually identify and assess risks on their distribution lines, to remediate conditions that present a potential threat to line integrity, and to monitor program effectiveness.

(3) Excess flow valves.

(A) In general .

The minimum standards shall include a requirement for an operator of a natural gas distribution system to install an excess flow valve on each single family residence service line connected to such system if

(i) the service line is installed or entirely replaced after June 1, 2008 ;

(ii) the service line operates continuously throughout the year at a pressure not less than 10 pounds per square inch gauge;

(iii) the service line is not connected to a gas stream with respect to which the operator has had prior experience with contaminants the presence of which could interfere with the operation of an excess flow valve;

(iv) the installation of an excess flow valve on the service line is not likely to cause loss of service to the residence or interfere with necessary operation or maintenance activities, such as purging liquids from the service line; and

(v) an excess flow valve meeting performance standards developed under section 60110(e) of title 49 , United States Code, is commercially available to the operator, as determined by the Secretary.

(B) Distribution branch services, multifamily facilities, and small commercial facilities .

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, and after issuing a final report on the evaluation of the National Transportation Safety Board’s recommendation on excess flow valves in applications other than service lines serving one single family residence, the Secretary, if appropriate, shall by regulation require the use of excess flow valves, or equivalent technology, where economically, technically, and operationally feasible on new or entirely replaced distribution branch services, multifamily facilities, and small commercial facilities.

(C) Reports .

Operators of natural gas distribution systems shall report annually to the Secretary on the number of excess flow valves installed on their systems under subparagraph (A).

(4) Applicability .

The Secretary shall determine which distribution pipelines will be subject to the minimum standards.

(5) Development and implementation .

Each operator of a distribution pipeline that the Secretary determines is subject to the minimum standards prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection shall develop and implement an integrity management program in accordance with those standards.

(6) Savings clause .

Subject to section 60104(c), a State authority having a current certification under section 60105 may adopt or continue in force additional integrity management requirements, including additional requirements for installation of excess flow valves, for gas distribution pipelines within the boundaries of that State.

(7) Evaluation of risk.

(A) In general .

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations to ensure that each distribution integrity management plan developed by an operator of a distribution system includes an evaluation of

(i) the risks resulting from the presence of cast iron pipes and mains in the distribution system; and

(ii) the risks that could lead to or result from the operation of a low-pressure distribution system at a pressure that makes the operation of any connected and properly adjusted low-pressure gas burning equipment unsafe, as determined by the Secretary.

(B) Consideration .

In carrying out subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary shall ensure that an operator of a distribution system

(i) considers factors other than past observed abnormal operating conditions (as defined in section 192.803 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation)) in ranking risks and identifying measures to mitigate those risks; and

(ii) may not determine that there are no potential consequences associated with low probability events unless that determination is otherwise supported by engineering analysis or operational knowledge.

(C) Deadlines.

(i) In general .

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this paragraph, each operator of a distribution system shall make available to the Secretary or the relevant State authority with a certification in effect under section 60105, as applicable, a copy of

(I) the distribution integrity management plan of the operator;

(II) the emergency response plan under section 60102(d)(5); and

(III) the procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies under section 60102(d)(4).

(ii) Updates .

Each operator of a distribution system shall make available to the Secretary or make available for inspection to the relevant State authority described in clause (i), if applicable, an updated plan or manual described in that clause by not later than 60 days after the date of a significant update, as determined by the Secretary.

(iii) Applicability of foia .

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the disclosure of any information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 .

(D) Review of plans and documents.

(i) Timing.

(I) In general .

Not later than 2 years after the date of promulgation of the regulations under subparagraph (A), and not less frequently than once every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary or relevant State authority with a certification in effect under section 60105 shall review the distribution integrity management plan, the emergency response plan, and the procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies of each operator of a distribution system and record the results of that review for use in the next review of the program of that operator.

(II) Grace period .

For the third, fourth, and fifth years after the date of promulgation of the regulations under subparagraph (A), the Secretary

(aa) shall not use subclause (I) as justification to reduce funding, decertify, or penalize in any way under section 60105, 60106, or 60107 a State authority that has in effect a certification under section 60105 or an agreement under section 60106; and

(bb) shall

(AA) submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a list of States found to be noncompliant with subclause (I) during the annual program evaluation; and

(BB) provide a written notice to each State authority described in item (aa) that is not in compliance with the requirements of subclause (I).

(ii) Review .

Each plan or procedural manual made available under subparagraph (C)(i) shall be reexamined

(I) on significant change to the plans or procedural manual, as applicable;

(II) on significant change to the gas distribution system of the operator, as applicable; and

(III) not less frequently than once every 5 years.

(iii) Context of review .

The Secretary may conduct a review under clause (i) or (ii) as an element of the inspection of the operator carried out by the Secretary.

(iv) Inadequate programs .

If the Secretary determines that the documents reviewed under clause (i) or (ii) do not comply with the requirements of this chapter (including regulations to implement this chapter), have not been adequately implemented, or are inadequate for the safe operation of a pipeline facility, the Secretary may conduct proceedings under this chapter.
