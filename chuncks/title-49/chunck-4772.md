#### § 70102. National freight strategic plan
###### (b) Contents .

The national freight strategic plan shall include

(1) an assessment of the condition and performance of the National Multimodal Freight Network established under section 70103;

(2) forecasts of freight volumes for the succeeding 5-, 10-, and 20-year periods;

(3) an identification of major trade gateways and national freight corridors that connect major population centers, trade gateways, and other major freight generators;

(4) an identification of bottlenecks on the National Multimodal Freight Network that create significant freight congestion, based on a quantitative methodology developed by the Assistant Secretary, which shall include, at a minimum

(A) information from the Freight Analysis Framework of the Federal Highway Administration; and

(B) to the maximum extent practicable, an estimate of the cost of addressing each bottleneck and any operational improvements that could be implemented;

(5) an assessment of statutory, regulatory, technological, institutional, financial, and other barriers to improved freight transportation performance, and a description of opportunities for overcoming the barriers;

(6) a process for addressing multistate projects and encouraging jurisdictions to collaborate;

(7) strategies to improve freight intermodal connectivity;

(8) an identification of corridors providing access to energy exploration, development, installation, or production areas;

(9) an identification of corridors providing access to major areas for manufacturing, agriculture, or natural resources;

(10) an identification of best practices for improving the performance of the National Multimodal Freight Network, including critical commerce corridors and rural and urban access to critical freight corridors;

(11) an identification of best practices to mitigate the impacts of freight movement on communities;

(12) best practices for reducing environmental impacts of freight movement (including reducing local air pollution from freight movement, stormwater runoff, and wildlife habitat loss resulting from freight facilities, freight vehicles, or freight activity);

(13) possible strategies to increase the resilience of the freight system, including the ability to anticipate, prepare for, or adapt to conditions, or withstand, respond to, or recover rapidly from disruptions, including extreme weather and natural disasters;

(14) strategies to promote United States economic growth and international competitiveness;

(15) consideration of any potential unique impacts of the national freight system on rural and other underserved and historically disadvantaged communities;

(16) strategies for decarbonizing freight movement, as appropriate; and

(17) consideration of the impacts of e-commerce on the national multimodal freight system.
