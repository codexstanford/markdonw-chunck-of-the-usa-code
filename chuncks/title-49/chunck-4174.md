#### § 47110. Allowable project costs
###### (b) Allowable Cost Standards .

A project cost is allowable

(1)

(A) if the cost necessarily is incurred in carrying out the project in compliance with the grant agreement made for the project under this subchapter, including any cost a sponsor incurs related to an audit the Secretary requires under section 47121(b) or (d) of this title and any cost of moving a Federal facility impeding the project if the rebuilt facility is of an equivalent size and type; or

(B) if the cost is an incentive payment incurred in carrying out the project described in subparagraph (A) that is to be provided to a contractor upon early completion of a project, if

(i) such payment does not exceed the lesser of 5 percent of the initial construction contract amount or $1,000,000;

(ii) the level of contractor’s control of, or access to, the worksite necessary to shorten the duration of the project does not negatively impact the operation of the airport;

(iii) the contract specifies application of the incentive structure in the event of unforeseeable, non-weather delays beyond the control of the contractor;

(iv) nothing in any agreement with the contractor prevents the airport operator from retaining responsibility for the safety, efficiency, and capacity of the airport during the execution of the grant agreement; and

(v) the Secretary determines that the use of an incentive payment is likely to increase airport capacity or efficiency or result in cost savings as a result of shortening the project’s duration;

(2)

(A) if the cost is incurred after the grant agreement is executed and is for airport development or airport planning carried out after the grant agreement is executed;

(B) if the cost is incurred after June 1, 1989 , by the airport operator (regardless of when the grant agreement is executed) as part of a Government-approved noise compatibility program (including project formulation costs) and is consistent with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements;

(C) if the Government’s share is paid only with amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 47114(c) or section 47114(d)(3)(A) and if the cost is incurred

(i) after September 30, 1996 ;

(ii) before a grant agreement is executed for the project; and

(iii) in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after the grant agreement had been executed; or

(D) if the cost is for airport development and is incurred before execution of the grant agreement, but in the same fiscal year as execution of the grant agreement, and if

(i) the cost was incurred before execution of the grant agreement because the airport has a shortened construction season due to climatic conditions in the vicinity of the airport;

(ii) the cost is in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after execution of the grant agreement, including submission of a complete grant application to the appropriate regional or district office of the Federal Aviation Administration;

(iii) the sponsor notifies the Secretary before authorizing work to commence on the project;

(iv) the sponsor has an alternative funding source available to fund the project; and

(v) the sponsor’s decision to proceed with the project in advance of execution of the grant agreement does not affect the priority assigned to the project by the Secretary for the allocation of discretionary funds;

(3) to the extent the cost is reasonable in amount;

(4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted;

(5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in section 47108(b) of this title );

(6) if the cost is for a project not described in section 47102(3) for acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles and ground support equipment owned by an airport that include low-emission technology, but only to the extent of the incremental cost of equipping such vehicles or equipment with low-emission technology, as determined by the Secretary; and

(7) if the cost is incurred on a measure to improve the efficiency of an airport building (such as a measure designed to meet one or more of the criteria for being considered a high-performance green building as set forth under section 401(13) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( 42 U.S.C. 17061(13) )) and

(A) the measure is for a project for airport development;

(B) the measure is for an airport building that is otherwise eligible for construction assistance under this subchapter; and

(C) if the measure results in an increase in initial project costs, the increase is justified by expected savings over the life cycle of the project.
