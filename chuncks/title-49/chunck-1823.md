(2) A capital project as defined in section 22901(2), except that a project shall not be required to be in a State rail plan developed under chapter 227.

(3) A capital project identified by the Secretary as being necessary to address congestion or safety challenges affecting rail service.

(4) A capital project identified by the Secretary as being necessary to reduce congestion and facilitate ridership growth in intercity passenger rail transportation along heavily traveled rail corridors.

(5) A highway-rail grade crossing improvement project, including installation, repair, or improvement of grade separations, railroad crossing signals, gates, and related technologies, highway traffic signalization, highway lighting and crossing approach signage, roadway improvements such as medians or other barriers, railroad crossing panels and surfaces, and safety engineering improvements to reduce risk in quiet zones or potential quiet zones.

(6) A rail line relocation or improvement project.

(7) A capital project to improve short-line or regional railroad infrastructure.

(8) The preparation of regional rail and corridor service development plans and corresponding environmental analyses.

(9) Any project that the Secretary considers necessary to enhance multimodal connections or facilitate service integration between rail service and other modes, including between intercity rail passenger transportation and intercity bus service or commercial air service.

(13) Workforce development and training activities, coordinated to the extent practicable with the existing local training programs supported by the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Education.

(14) Research, development, and testing to advance and facilitate innovative rail projects, including projects using electromagnetic guideways in an enclosure in a very low-pressure environment.

(15) The preparation of emergency plans for communities through which hazardous materials are transported by rail.

(16) Rehabilitating, remanufacturing, procuring, or overhauling locomotives, provided that such activities result in a significant reduction of emissions.
