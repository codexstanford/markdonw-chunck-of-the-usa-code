###### (b) Tariff Requirements for Noncontiguous Domestic Trade.

(1) Filing .

A carrier providing transportation or service described in subsection (a)(1) shall publish and file with the Board tariffs containing the rates established for such transportation or service. The carriers shall keep such tariffs available for public inspection. The Board shall prescribe the form and manner of publishing, filing, and keeping tariffs available for public inspection under this subsection.

(2) Contents .

The Board may prescribe any specific information and charges to be identified in a tariff, but at a minimum tariffs must identify plainly

(A) the carriers that are parties to it;

(B) the places between which property will be transported;

(C) terminal charges if a carrier provides transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter III of chapter 135;

(D) privileges given and facilities allowed; and

(E) any rules that change, affect, or determine any part of the published rate.

(3) Inland divisions .

A carrier providing transportation or service described in subsection (a)(1) under a joint rate for a through movement shall not be required to state separately or otherwise reveal in tariff filings the inland divisions of that through rate.

(4) Time-volume rates .

Rates in tariffs filed under this subsection may vary with the volume of cargo offered over a specified period of time.

(5) Changes .

The Board may permit carriers to change rates, classifications, rules, and practices without filing complete tariffs under this subsection that cover matter that is not being changed when the Board finds that action to be consistent with the public interest. Those carriers may either

(A) publish new tariffs that incorporate changes, or

(B) plainly indicate the proposed changes in the tariffs then in effect and make the tariffs as changed available for public inspection.

(6) Complaints .

A complaint that a rate or related rule or practice maintained in a tariff under this subsection violates section 13701(a) may be submitted to the Board for resolution.
