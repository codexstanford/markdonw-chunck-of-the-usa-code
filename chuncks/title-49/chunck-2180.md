## SUBTITLE VI— MOTOR VEHICLE AND DRIVER PROGRAMS
### CHAPTER 301— MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY
#### § 30120. Remedies for defects and noncompliance
###### (i) Limitation on Sale or Lease of New Vehicles or Equipment, or Rental.

(1) In general .

If notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title or is required under section 30118(c) of this title and the manufacturer has provided to a dealer (including retailers of motor vehicle equipment) notification about a new motor vehicle or new item of replacement equipment in the dealer’s possession at the time of notification or the manufacturer has provided to a rental company notification about a covered rental vehicle in the company’s possession at the time of notification that contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter, the dealer or rental company may sell, lease, or rent the motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment only if

(A) the defect or noncompliance is remedied as required by this section before delivery under the sale, lease, or rental agreement; or

(B) when the notification is required by an order under section 30118(b) of this title , enforcement of the order is restrained or the order is set aside in a civil action to which section 30121(d) of this title applies.

(2) Rule of construction .

Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit a dealer or rental company from offering the vehicle or equipment for sale, lease, or rent.

(3) Specific rules for rental companies.

(A) In general .

Except as otherwise provided under this paragraph, a rental company shall comply with the limitations on sale, lease, or rental set forth in subparagraph (C) and paragraph (1) as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours after the earliest receipt of the notice to owner under subsection (b) or (c) of section 30118 (including the vehicle identification number for the covered vehicle) by the rental company, whether by electronic means or first class mail.

(B) Special rule for large vehicle fleets .

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a rental company receives a notice to owner covering more than 5,000 motor vehicles in its fleet, the rental company shall comply with the limitations on sale, lease, or rental set forth in subparagraph (C) and paragraph (1) as soon as practicable, but not later than 48 hours after the earliest receipt of the notice to owner under subsection (b) or (c) of section 30118 (including the vehicle identification number for the covered vehicle) by the rental company, whether by electronic means or first class mail.

(C) Special rule for when remedies not immediately available .

If a notification required under subsection (b) or (c) of section 30118 indicates that the remedy for the defect or noncompliance is not immediately available and specifies actions to temporarily alter the vehicle that eliminate the safety risk posed by the defect or noncompliance, the rental company, after causing the specified actions to be performed, may rent (but may not sell or lease) the motor vehicle. Once the remedy for the rental vehicle becomes available to the rental company, the rental company may not rent the vehicle until the vehicle has been remedied, as provided in subsection (a).

(D) Inapplicability to junk automobiles .

Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this subsection does not prohibit a rental company from selling a covered rental vehicle if such vehicle

(i) meets the definition of a junk automobile under section 201 of the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 ( 49 U.S.C. 30501 );

(ii) is retitled as a junk automobile pursuant to applicable State law; and

(iii) is reported to the National Motor Vehicle Information System, if required under section 204 of such Act ( 49 U.S.C. 30504 ).
