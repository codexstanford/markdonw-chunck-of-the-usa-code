###### (g) Letters of Intent; Phased Funding Agreements.

(1) Letters of intent .

The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to a grantee under this section that

(A) announces an intention to obligate, for a major capital project under this section, an amount from future available budget authority specified in law that is not more than the amount stipulated as the financial participation of the Secretary in the project; and

(B) states that the contingent commitment

(i) is not an obligation of the Federal Government; and

(ii) is subject to the availability of appropriations for grants under this section and subject to Federal laws in force or enacted after the date of the contingent commitment.

(2) Phased funding agreements.

(A) In general .

The Secretary may enter into a phased funding agreement with an applicant if

(i) the project is highly rated, based on the evaluations and ratings conducted pursuant to this section and the applicable notice of funding opportunity; and

(ii) the Federal assistance to be provided for the project under this section is more than $80,000,000.

(B) Terms .

A phased funding agreement shall

(i) establish the terms of participation by the Federal Government in the project;

(ii) establish the maximum amount of Federal financial assistance for the project;

(iii) include the period of time for completing the project, even if such period extends beyond the period for which Federal financial assistance is authorized;

(iv) make timely and efficient management of the project easier in accordance with Federal law; and

(v) if applicable, specify when the process for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and related environmental laws will be completed for the project.

(C) Special financial rules.

(i) In general .

A phased funding agreement under this paragraph obligates an amount of available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment, contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an additional amount from future available budget authority specified in law.

(ii) Statement of contingent commitment .

The agreement shall state that the contingent commitment is not an obligation of the Government.

(iii) Interest and other financing costs .

Interest and other financing costs of efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project under a phased funding agreement, except that eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall certify, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking the most favorable financing terms.

(iv) Failure to carry out project .

If an applicant does not carry out the project for reasons within the control of the applicant, the applicant shall repay all Federal grant funds awarded for the project from all Federal funding sources, for all project activities, facilities, and equipment, plus reasonable interest and penalty charges allowable by law or established by the Secretary in the phased funding agreement. For purposes of this clause, a process for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) that results in the selection of the no build alternative is not within the applicant’s control.

The Secretary may enter into phased funding agreements under this subsection that contain contingent commitments to incur obligations in such amounts as the Secretary determines are appropriate.

An obligation or administrative commitment may be made under this section only when amounts are appropriated for such purpose.
