(C) The board shall develop for purposes of charging fees no more than 6 and no less than 4 brackets of carriers (including motor private carriers) based on the size of fleet.

(D) The fee scale shall be progressive in the amount of the fee.

(ii) exceed those revenues.

(2) Determination of ownership or operation .

For purposes of this subsection, a commercial motor vehicle is owned or operated by a motor carrier, motor private carrier, or freight forwarder if the vehicle is registered under Federal law or State law, or both, in the name of the motor carrier, motor private carrier, or freight forwarder or is controlled by the motor carrier, motor private carrier, or freight forwarder under a long term lease during a vehicle registration year.

(3) Calculation of number of commercial motor vehicles owned or operated .

The number of commercial motor vehicles owned or operated by a motor carrier, motor private carrier, or freight forwarder for purposes of paragraph (1) shall be based either on the number of commercial motor vehicles the motor carrier, motor private carrier, or freight forwarder has indicated it operates on its most recently filed MCS–150 or the total number of such vehicles it owned or operated for the 12-month period ending on June 30 of the year immediately prior to the registration year of the Unified Carrier Registration System. A motor carrier may include in the calculation of its fleet size for purposes of paragraph (1) any commercial motor vehicle.
