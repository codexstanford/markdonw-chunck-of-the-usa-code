###### (e) The Secretary may negotiate, without advertising, the purchase of technical or special property related to air navigation when the Secretary decides that

(2) procurement by advertising would likely result in additional cost to the Government by duplication of investment or would result in duplication of necessary preparation that would unreasonably delay procuring the property.
