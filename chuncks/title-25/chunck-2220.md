(B) the recipient has agreed that it will utilize such income for housing related activities in accordance with this chapter.

(2) Prohibition of restricted access or reduction of grant

The Secretary may not restrict access to or reduce the grant amount for any Indian tribe based solely on

(D) whether the recipient has expended retained program income for housing-related activities.

(4) Exclusion from program income of regular developer’s fees for low-income housing tax credit projects

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any income derived from a regular and customary developer’s fee for any project that receives a low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of title 26 , and that is initially funded using a grant provided under this chapter, shall not be considered to be program income if the developer’s fee is approved by the State housing credit agency.
