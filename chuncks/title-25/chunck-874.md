### CHAPTER 18— INDIAN HEALTH CARE
#### § 1632. Safe water and sanitary waste disposal facilities
##### (a) Congressional findings

The Congress hereby finds and declares that

(1) the provision of safe water supply systems and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal systems is primarily a health consideration and function;

(2) Indian people suffer an inordinately high incidence of disease, injury, and illness directly attributable to the absence or inadequacy of such systems;

(3) the long-term cost to the United States of treating and curing such disease, injury, and illness is substantially greater than the short-term cost of providing such systems and other preventive health measures;

(4) many Indian homes and communities still lack safe water supply systems and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal systems; and

(5) it is in the interest of the United States, and it is the policy of the United States, that all Indian communities and Indian homes, new and existing, be provided with safe and adequate water supply systems and sanitary sewage waste disposal systems as soon as possible.
