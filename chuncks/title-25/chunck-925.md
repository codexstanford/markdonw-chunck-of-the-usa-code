(2) Direct reimbursement

(A) Use of funds

Each tribal health program making the election described in paragraph (1) with respect to a program under a title of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] shall be reimbursed directly by that program for items and services furnished without regard to subsection (c)(1), except that all amounts so reimbursed shall be used by the tribal health program for the purpose of making any improvements in facilities of the tribal health program that may be necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with the conditions and requirements applicable generally to such items and services under the program under such title and to provide additional health care services, improvements in health care facilities and tribal health programs, any health care-related purpose (including coverage for a service or service within a contract health service delivery area or any portion of a contract health service delivery area that would otherwise be provided as a contract health service), or otherwise to achieve the objectives provided in section 1602 of this title .

(B) Audits

The amounts paid to a tribal health program making the election described in paragraph (1) with respect to a program under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act shall be subject to all auditing requirements applicable to the program under such title, as well as all auditing requirements applicable to programs administered by an Indian health program. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the application of auditing requirements applicable to amounts paid under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act.

(C) Identification of source of payments

Any tribal health program that receives reimbursements or payments under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act shall provide to the Service a list of each provider enrollment number (or other identifier) under which such program receives such reimbursements or payments.

(3) Examination and implementation of changes

(A) In general

The Secretary, acting through the Service and with the assistance of the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, shall examine on an ongoing basis and implement any administrative changes that may be necessary to facilitate direct billing and reimbursement under the program established under this subsection, including any agreements with States that may be necessary to provide for direct billing under a program under title XIX or XXI of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.].

The Service shall provide the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with copies of the lists submitted to the Service under paragraph (2)(C), enrollment data regarding patients served by the Service (and by tribal health programs, to the extent such data is available to the Service), and such other information as the Administrator may require for purposes of administering title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act.

(4) Withdrawal from program

A tribal health program that bills directly under the program established under this subsection may withdraw from participation in the same manner and under the same conditions that an Indian tribe or tribal organization may retrocede a contracted program to the Secretary under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act ( 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.). 2 All cost accounting and billing authority under the program established under this subsection shall be returned to the Secretary upon the Secretary’s acceptance of the withdrawal of participation in this program.

The Secretary may terminate the participation of a tribal health program or  3 in the direct billing program established under this subsection if the Secretary determines that the program has failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (2). The Secretary shall provide a tribal health program with notice of a determination that the program has failed to comply with any such requirement and a reasonable opportunity to correct such noncompliance prior to terminating the program’s participation in the direct billing program established under this subsection.
