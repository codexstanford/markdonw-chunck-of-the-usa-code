(1) Procedure upon refusal to approve plan

If the Secretary denies a plan under subsection (b)(3), the Secretary shall

(A) state any objections in writing to the Indian tribe;

(B) provide assistance to the Indian tribe to overcome the stated objections; and

(C) unless the Indian tribe brings a civil action under paragraph (2), provide the Indian tribe with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may promulgate.

(2) Civil actions

(A) In general

The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of a civil action against the appropriate Secretary arising under this section.

(B) Administrative hearing and appeal not required

An Indian tribe may bring a civil action under this paragraph without regard to whether the Indian tribe had a hearing or filed an appeal under paragraph (1).

(C) Relief

In an action brought under this paragraph, the court may order appropriate relief (including injunctive relief to reverse a denial of a plan under this section or to compel an officer or employee of the United States, or any agency thereof, to perform a duty provided under this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder) against any action by an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof contrary to this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder.

(3) Final agency action

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a decision by an official of the Department of the Interior or the Department of Health and Human Services, as appropriate (collectively referred to in this paragraph as the “Department”) that constitutes final agency action and that relates to an appeal within the Department that is conducted under paragraph (1)(C) shall be made

(A) by an official of the Department who holds a position at a higher organizational level within the Department than the level of the departmental agency (such as the Indian Health Service or the Bureau of Indian Affairs) in which the decision that is the subject of the appeal was made; or

(B) by an administrative law judge.
