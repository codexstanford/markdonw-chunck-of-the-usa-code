### CHAPTER 26— INDIAN ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
#### § 2415. Federal facilities, property, and equipment; leasing of tribal property
##### (b) Costs

Any additional cost associated with the use of Federal facilities, property, or equipment under subsection (a) may be borne by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services out of available Federal, tribal, State, local, or private funds, if not otherwise prohibited by law. This subsection does not require the Secretary of the Interior, nor the Attorney General, nor the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expend additional funds to meet the additional costs which may be associated with the provision of such facilities, property, or equipment for community use. Where the use of Federal facilities, property, or equipment under subsection (a) furthers the purposes and goals of this chapter, the use of funds other than those funds appropriated to the Department of the Interior, the Department of Justice, or the Department of Health and Human Services to meet the additional costs associated with such use shall not constitute an augmentation of Federal appropriations.
