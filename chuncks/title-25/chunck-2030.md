#### § 3506. Wind and hydropower feasibility study
##### (b) Scope of study

The study shall

(1) determine the economic and engineering feasibility of blending wind energy and hydropower generated from the Missouri River dams operated by the Army Corps of Engineers, including an assessment of the costs and benefits of blending wind energy and hydropower compared to current sources used for firming power to the Western Area Power Administration;

(2) review historical and projected requirements for, patterns of availability and use of, and reasons for historical patterns concerning the availability of firming power;

(3) assess the wind energy resource potential on tribal land and projected cost savings through a blend of wind and hydropower over a 30-year period;

(4) determine seasonal capacity needs and associated transmission upgrades for integration of tribal wind generation and identify costs associated with these activities;

(5) include an independent tribal engineer and a Western Area Power Administration customer representative as study team members; and

(6) incorporate, to the extent appropriate, the results of the Dakotas Wind Transmission study prepared by the Western Area Power Administration.
