All reasonable efforts shall be made to provide notice of action instituted under paragraph (1)(B) to the individual to whom health services were provided, either before or during the pendency of such action.

(3) Recovery from tortfeasors

(A) In general

In any case in which an Indian tribe or tribal organization that is authorized or required under a compact or contract issued pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act ( 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.)  1 to furnish or pay for health services to a person who is injured or suffers a disease on or after March 23, 2010 , under circumstances that establish grounds for a claim of liability against the tortfeasor with respect to the injury or disease, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall have a right to recover from the tortfeasor (or an insurer of the tortfeasor) the reasonable value of the health services so furnished, paid for, or to be paid for, in accordance with the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act ( 42 U.S.C. 2651 et seq.), to the same extent and under the same circumstances as the United States may recover under that Act.
