(1) The Secretary, acting through the Service, is authorized to make grants to Indian tribes and inter-tribal consortia to pay 75 percent of the cost of planning, developing, and implementing programs to deliver innovative community-based mental health services to Indians. The 25 percent tribal share of such cost may be provided in cash or through the provision of property or services.

(D) The tribe or consortium has the administrative and financial capability to administer the project.

(E) The project will deliver services in a manner consistent with traditional Indian healing and treatment practices.

(3) For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary shall, in evaluating applications for grants for projects to be operated under any contract entered into with the Service under the Indian Self-Determination Act [ 25 U.S.C. 5321 et seq.], use the same criteria that the Secretary uses in evaluating any other application for such a grant.

(4) The Secretary may only award one grant under this subsection with respect to a service area until the Secretary has awarded grants for all service areas with respect to which the Secretary receives applications during the application period, as determined by the Secretary, which meet the criteria specified in paragraph (2).

(5) Not later than 180 days after the close of the term of the last grant awarded pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report evaluating the effectiveness of the innovative community-based projects demonstrated pursuant to this subsection. Such report shall include findings and recommendations, if any, relating to the reorganization of the programs of the Service for delivery of mental health services to Indians.
