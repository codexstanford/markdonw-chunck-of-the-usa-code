#### § 5615. Effect of subchapter
##### (b) Deviation from standard practices

The United States shall not be liable to any party (including any Indian tribe) for any term of, or any loss resulting from the terms of, an Indian trust asset management plan that provides for management of a trust asset at a less-stringent standard than the Secretary would otherwise require or adhere to in absence of an Indian trust asset management plan.
