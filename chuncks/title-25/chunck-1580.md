### CHAPTER 27— TRIBALLY CONTROLLED SCHOOL GRANTS
#### § 2501. Declaration of policy
##### (a) Recognition

Congress recognizes that the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [ 25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], which was a product of the legitimate aspirations and a recognition of the inherent authority of Indian nations, was and is a crucial positive step toward tribal and community control and that the United States has an obligation to assure maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational services so as to render the persons administering such services and the services themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of Indian communities.
