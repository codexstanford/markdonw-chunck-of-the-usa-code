### CHAPTER 46— INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION AND EDUCATION ASSISTANCE
#### § 5392. Facilitation
##### (b) Regulation waiver

(1) In general

An Indian tribe may submit a written request to waive application of a regulation promulgated under section 5397 of this title or the authorities specified in section 5385(b) of this title for a compact or funding agreement entered into with the Indian Health Service under this subchapter, to the Secretary identifying the applicable Federal regulation sought to be waived and the basis for the request.

(2) Approval

Not later than 90 days after receipt by the Secretary of a written request by an Indian tribe to waive application of a regulation for a compact or funding agreement entered into under this subchapter, the Secretary shall either approve or deny the requested waiver in writing. A denial may be made only upon a specific finding by the Secretary that identified language in the regulation may not be waived because such waiver is prohibited by Federal law. A failure to approve or deny a waiver request not later than 90 days after receipt shall be deemed an approval of such request. The Secretary’s decision shall be final for the Department.
