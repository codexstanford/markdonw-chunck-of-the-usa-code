### CHAPTER 24— INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION
#### § 2205. Tribal probate codes; acquisitions of fractional interests by tribes
##### (c) Authority available to Indian tribes

(1) Authority

(A) In general

If the owner of an interest in trust or restricted land devises an interest in such land to a non-Indian under section 2206(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title , the Indian tribe that exercises jurisdiction over the parcel of land involved may acquire such interest by paying to the Secretary the fair market value of such interest, as determined by the Secretary on the date of the decedent’s death.

(B) Transfer

The Secretary shall transfer payments received under subparagraph (A) to any person or persons who would have received an interest in land if the interest had not been acquired by the Indian tribe in accordance with this paragraph.

(2) Limitation

(A) Inapplicability to certain interests

(i) In general

Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an interest in trust or restricted land if

(I) while the decedent’s estate is pending before the Secretary, the non-Indian devisee renounces the interest in favor of an Indian person; or

(II)

(aa) the interest is part of a family farm that is devised to a member of the family of the decedent; and

(bb) the devisee agrees in writing that the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land will have the opportunity to acquire the interest for fair market value if the interest is offered for sale to a person or entity that is not a member of the family of the owner of the land.

(ii) Recording of interest

On request by the Indian tribe described in clause (i)(II)(bb), a restriction relating to the acquisition by the Indian tribe of an interest in a family farm involved shall be recorded as part of the deed relating to the interest involved.

(iii) Mortgage and foreclosure

Nothing in clause (i)(II) limits

(I) the ability of an owner of land to which that clause applies to mortgage the land; or

(II) the right of the entity holding such a mortgage to foreclose or otherwise enforce such a mortgage agreement in accordance with applicable law.

(iv) Definition of “member of the family”

In this paragraph, the term “member of the family”, with respect to a decedent or landowner, means

(I) a lineal descendant of a decedent or landowner;

(II) a lineal descendant of the grandparent of a decedent or landowner;

(III) the spouse of a descendant or landowner described in subclause (I) or (II); and

(IV) the spouse of a decedent or landowner.

(B) Reservation of life estate

A non-Indian devisee described in paragraph (1), may retain a life estate in the interest involved, including a life estate to the revenue produced from the interest. The amount of any payment required under paragraph (1) shall be reduced to reflect the value of any life estate reserved by a non-Indian devisee under this subparagraph.

(3) Payments

With respect to payments by an Indian tribe under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) upon the request of the tribe, allow a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 2 years, for the tribe to make payments of amounts due pursuant to paragraph (1); or

(B) recognize alternative agreed upon exchanges of consideration or extended payment terms between the non-Indian devisee described in paragraph (1) and the tribe in satisfaction of the payment under paragraph (1).
