### CHAPTER 24— INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION
#### § 2206. Descent and distribution
##### (j) General rules governing probate

(1) Scope

Except as provided under applicable Federal law or a tribal probate code approved under section 2205 of this title , the provisions of this subsection shall govern the probate of estates containing trust and restricted interests in land or trust personalty.

(2) Pretermitted spouses and children

(A) Spouses

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), if the surviving spouse of a testator married the testator after the testator executed the will of the testator, the surviving spouse shall receive the intestate share in the decedent’s trust or restricted land and trust personalty that the spouse would have received if the testator had died intestate.

(ii) Exception

Clause (i) shall not apply to a trust or restricted interest in land where

(I) the will of a testator is executed before the date that is 1 year after the date on which the Secretary publishes a notice of certification under section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004 ( 25 U.S.C. 2201 note; Public Law 108–374 );

(II)

(aa) the spouse of a testator is a non-Indian; and

(bb) the testator devised the interests in trust or restricted land of the testator to 1 or more Indians;

(III) it appears, based on an examination of the will or other evidence, that the will was made in contemplation of the marriage of the testator to the surviving spouse;

(IV) the will expresses the intention that the will is to be effective notwithstanding any subsequent marriage; or

(V)

(aa) the testator provided for the spouse by a transfer of funds or property outside the will; and

(bb) an intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is demonstrated by statements of the testator or through a reasonable inference based on the amount of the transfer or other evidence.

(iii) Spouses married at the time of the will

Should the surviving spouse of the testator be omitted from the will of the testator, the surviving spouse shall be treated, for purposes of trust or restricted land or trust personalty in the testator’s estate, in accordance with subsection (a)(2)(A), as though there was no will but only if

(I) the testator and surviving spouse were continuously married without legal separation for the 5-year period preceding the decedent’s death;

(II) the testator and surviving spouse have a surviving child who is the child of the testator;

(III) the surviving spouse has made substantial payments toward the purchase of, or improvements to, the trust or restricted land in such estate; or

(IV) the surviving spouse is under a binding obligation to continue making loan payments for the trust or restricted land for a substantial period of time;  except that, if there is evidence that the testator adequately provided for the surviving spouse and any minor children by a transfer of funds or property outside of the will, this clause shall not apply.

(B) Children

(i) In general

If a testator executed the will of the testator before the birth or adoption of 1 or more children of the testator, and the omission of the children from the will is a product of inadvertence rather than an intentional omission, the children shall share in the trust or restricted interests in land and trust personalty as if the decedent had died intestate.

(ii) Adopted heirs

Any person recognized as an heir by virtue of adoption under the Act of July 8, 1940 ( 25 U.S.C. 372a ), shall be treated as the child of a decedent under this subsection.

(iii) Adopted-out children

(I) In general

For purposes of this chapter, an adopted person shall not be considered the child or issue of his natural parents, except in distributing the estate of a natural kin, other than the natural parent, who has maintained a family relationship with the adopted person. If a natural parent shall have married the adopting parent, the adopted person for purposes of inheritance by, from and through him shall also be considered the issue of such natural parent.

(II) Eligible heir pursuant to other Federal law or tribal law

Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B)(iii)(I), other Federal laws and laws of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the trust or restricted interest in land may otherwise define the inheritance rights of adopted-out children.

(3) Divorce

(A) Surviving spouse

(i) In general

An individual who is divorced from a decedent, or whose marriage to the decedent has been annulled, shall not be considered to be a surviving spouse unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, the individual is married to the decedent at the time of death of the decedent.

(ii) Separation

A decree of separation that does not dissolve a marriage, and terminate the status of husband and wife, shall not be considered a divorce for the purpose of this subsection.

(iii) No effect on adjudications

Nothing in clause (i) shall prevent the Secretary from giving effect to a property right settlement relating to a trust or restricted interest in land or an interest in trust personalty if 1 of the parties to the settlement dies before the issuance of a final decree dissolving the marriage of the parties to the property settlement.

(B) Effect of subsequent divorce on a will or devise

(i) In general

If, after executing a will, a testator is divorced or the marriage of the testator is annulled, as of the effective date of the divorce or annulment, any disposition of trust or restricted interests in land or of trust personalty made by the will to the former spouse of the testator shall be considered to be revoked unless the will expressly provides otherwise.

(ii) Property

Property that is prevented from passing to a former spouse of a decedent under clause (i) shall pass as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent.

(iii) Provisions of wills

Any provision of a will that is considered to be revoked solely by operation of this subparagraph shall be revived by the remarriage of a testator to the former spouse of the testator.

(4) After-born heirs

A child in gestation at the time of decedent’s death will be treated as having survived the decedent if the child lives at least 120 hours after its birth.

(5) Advancements of trust personalty during lifetime; effect on distribution of estate

(A) The trust personalty of a decedent who dies intestate as to all or a portion of his or her estate, given during the decedent’s lifetime to a person eligible to be an heir of the decedent under subsection (b)(2)(B), shall be treated as an advancement against the heir’s inheritance, but only if the decedent declared in a contemporaneous writing, or the heir acknowledged in writing, that the gift is an advancement or is to be taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent’s intestate estate.

(B) For the purposes of this section, trust personalty advanced during the decedent’s lifetime is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of the decedent’s death, whichever occurs first.

(C) If the recipient of the trust personalty predeceases the decedent, the property shall not be treated as an advancement or taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent’s intestate estate unless the decedent’s contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.

(6) Heirs related to decedent through 2 lines; single share

A person who is related to the decedent through 2 lines of relationship is entitled to only a single share of the trust or restricted land or trust personalty in the decedent’s estate based on the relationship that would entitle such person to the larger share.

(7) Notice

(A) In general

To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall notify each owner of trust and restricted land of the provisions of this chapter.

(B) Combined notices

The notice under subparagraph (A) may, at the discretion of the Secretary, be provided with the notice required under subsection (a) of section 8 of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004.

(8) Renunciation or disclaimer of interests

(A) In general

Any person 18 years of age or older may renounce or disclaim an inheritance of a trust or restricted interest in land or in trust personalty through intestate succession or devise, either in full or subject to the reservation of a life estate (where the interest is an interest in land), in accordance with subparagraph (B), by filing a signed and acknowledged declaration with the probate decisionmaker prior to entry of a final probate order. No interest so renounced or disclaimed shall be considered to have vested in the renouncing or disclaiming heir or devisee, and the renunciation or disclaimer shall not be considered to be a transfer or gift of the renounced or disclaimed interest.

(B) Eligible recipients of renounced or disclaimed interests; notice to recipients

(i) Interests in land

A trust or restricted interest in land may be renounced or disclaimed only in favor of

(I) an eligible heir;

(II) any person who would have been eligible to be a devisee of the interest in question pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A) (but only in cases where the renouncing person is a devisee of the interest under a valid will); or

(III) the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the interest in question;  and the interest so renounced shall pass to its recipient in trust or restricted status.

(ii) Trust personalty

An interest in trust personalty may be renounced or disclaimed in favor of any person who would be eligible to be a devisee of such an interest under subsection (b)(3) and shall pass to the recipient in accordance with the provisions of that subsection.

(iii) Unauthorized renunciations and disclaimers

Unless renounced or disclaimed in favor of a person or Indian tribe eligible to receive the interest in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, a renounced or disclaimed interest shall pass as if the renunciation or disclaimer had not been made.

(C) Acceptance of interest

A renunciation or disclaimer of an interest filed in accordance with this paragraph shall be considered accepted when implemented in a final order by a decisionmaker, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. No renunciation or disclaimer of an interest shall be included in such order unless the recipient of the interest has been given notice of the renunciation or disclaimer and has not refused to accept the interest. All disclaimers and renunciations filed and implemented in probate orders made effective prior to October 27, 2004 , are hereby ratified.

(D) Rule of construction

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow the renunciation of an interest that is subject to subsection (a)(2)(D) in favor of more than 1 person.

(9) Consolidation agreements

(A) In general

During the pendency of probate, the decisionmaker is authorized to approve written consolidation agreements effecting exchanges or gifts voluntarily entered into between the decedent’s eligible heirs or devisees, to consolidate interests in any tract of land included in the decedent’s trust inventory. Such agreements may provide for the conveyance of interests already owned by such heirs or devisees in such tracts, without having to comply with the Secretary’s rules and requirements otherwise applicable to conveyances by deed of trust or restricted interests in land.

(B) Effective

An agreement approved under subparagraph (A) shall be considered final when implemented in an order by a decisionmaker. The final probate order shall direct any changes necessary to the Secretary’s land records, to reflect and implement the terms of the approved agreement.

(C) Effect on purchase option at probate

Any interest in trust or restricted land that is subject to a consolidation agreement under this paragraph or subsection (e) shall not be available for purchase under subsection ( o ) unless the decisionmaker determines that the agreement should not be approved.
