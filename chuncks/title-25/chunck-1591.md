### CHAPTER 27— TRIBALLY CONTROLLED SCHOOL GRANTS
#### § 2502. Grants authorized
##### (f) Retrocession

(1) In general

Whenever a tribal governing body requests retrocession of any program for which assistance is provided under this chapter, such retrocession shall become effective upon a date specified by the Secretary that is not later than 120 days after the date on which the tribal governing body requests the retrocession. A later date may be specified if mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the tribal governing body. If such a program is retroceded, the Secretary shall provide to any Indian tribe served by such program at least the same quantity and quality of services that would have been provided under such program at the level of funding provided under this chapter prior to the retrocession.

(2) Status after retrocession

The tribe requesting retrocession shall specify whether the retrocession is to status as a Bureau-operated school or as a school operated under contract under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [ 25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.].

(3) Transfer of equipment and materials

Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary, the tribe or tribal organization operating the program to be retroceded must transfer to the Secretary (or to the tribe or tribal organization which will operate the program as a contract school) the existing equipment and materials which were acquired

(A) with assistance under this chapter; or

(B) upon assumption of operation of the program under this chapter, if the school was a Bureau-funded school under title XI of the Education Amendments of 1978 [ 25 U.S.C. 2000 et seq.] before receiving assistance under this chapter.
