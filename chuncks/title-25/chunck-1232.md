#### § 1813. Construction of new facilities
##### (d) Failure to use facility in approved manner; title to vest in United States; settlement

If, within twenty years after completion of construction of a facility which has been constructed in whole or in part with a grant made available under this section

(1) the facility ceases to be used by the applicant in a public or nonprofit capacity as an academic facility, unless the Secretary determines that there is good cause for releasing the institution from this obligation, and

(2) the tribe with which the applicant is affiliated fails to use the facility for a public purpose approved by the tribal government in furtherance of the general welfare of the community served by the tribal government, title to the facility shall vest in the United States and the applicant (or such tribe if such tribe is the successor in title to the facility) shall be entitled to recover from the United States an amount which bears the same ratio to the present value of the facility as the amount of the applicant’s contribution (excluding any funds provided under section 13 of this title ) bore to the original cost of the facility. Such value shall be determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the United States district court for the district in which such facility is located.
