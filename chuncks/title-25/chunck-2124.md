### CHAPTER 40— INDIAN DAMS SAFETY
#### § 3803. Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program
##### (e) Identification of dams

(1) Development of list

The Secretary shall develop a comprehensive list of dams located on Indian lands that describes the dam safety condition classification of each dam, as specified in paragraph (2), the risk hazard classification of each dam, as specified in paragraph (3), and the conditions resulting from maintenance deficiencies.

(2) Dam safety condition classifications

The dam safety condition classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications:

(A) Satisfactory

No existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. Safe performance is expected under all anticipated conditions.

(B) Fair

No existing dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal loading conditions. Infrequent hydrologic or seismic events would probably result in a dam safety deficiency.

(C) Conditionally poor

A potential dam safety deficiency is recognized for unusual loading conditions that may realistically occur during the expected life of the structure.

(D) Poor

A potential dam safety deficiency is clearly recognized for normal loading conditions. Immediate actions to resolve the deficiency are recommended; reservoir restrictions may be necessary until resolution of the problem.

(E) Unsatisfactory

A dam safety deficiency exists for normal loading conditions. Immediate remedial action is required for resolution of the problem.

(3) Risk hazard classification

The risk hazard classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications:

(A) High

Six or more lives would be at risk or extensive property damage could occur if the dam failed.

(B) Significant

Between one and six lives would be at risk or significant property damage could occur if the dam failed.

(C) Low

No lives would be at risk and limited property damage would occur if the dam failed.
