### CHAPTER 24— INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION
#### § 2219. Application to Alaska
##### (a) Findings

Congress finds that

(1) numerous academic and governmental organizations have studied the nature and extent of fractionated ownership of Indian land outside of Alaska and have proposed solutions to this problem; and

(2) despite these studies, there has not been a comparable effort to analyze the problem, if any, of fractionated ownership in Alaska.
