##### (a) Allocation of funds

(1) In general

The Secretary shall continue to determine the amount of program funds to be received by each grantee under this subchapter by the same method used for determining such distribution in fiscal year 1991 for tribally-administered and Bureau-administered programs of grants to individual Indians to defray postsecondary expenses.

(2) Administrative costs

In addition to the amount determined under paragraph (1), a grantee which has exercised the option given in section 3304(a) of this title to administer the program under a grant shall receive an amount for administrative costs determined pursuant to the method used by the grantee during the preceding contract period. All other grantees shall receive an amount for administrative costs determined pursuant to the regulations governing such determinations under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act [ 25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], as in effect at the time of application to grants being made.

(3) Single grant; separate accounts

Each grantee shall receive only one grant during any fiscal year, which shall include both of the amounts under paragraphs (1) and (2). Each grantee shall maintain this grant in a separate account.
