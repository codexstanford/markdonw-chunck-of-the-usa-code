##### (e) Eligible employees; Federal employee programs subject to retention

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 8347( o ), 8713, and 8914 of title 5, executive order, or administrative regulation, an employee serving under an appointment not limited to one year or less who leaves Federal employment to be employed by a tribal organization, the city of St. Paul, Alaska, the city of St. George, Alaska, upon incorporation, or the Village Corporations of St. Paul and St. George Islands established pursuant to section 1607 of title 43 , in connection with governmental or other activities which are or have been performed by employees in or for Indian communities is entitled, if the employee and the tribal organization so elect, to the following:

(1) To retain coverage, rights, and benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81 (“Compensation for Work Injuries”) of title 5, and for this purpose his employment with the tribal organization shall be deemed employment by the United States. However, if an injured employee, or his dependents in case of his death, receives from the tribal organization any payment (including an allowance, gratuity, payment under an insurance policy for which the premium is wholly paid by the tribal organization, or other benefit of any kind) on account of the same injury or death, the amount of that payment shall be credited against any benefit payable under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, as follows:

(A) payments on account of injury or disability shall be credited against disability compensation payable to the injured employee; and

(B) payments on account of death shall be credited against death compensation payable to dependents of the deceased employee.

(2) To retain coverage, rights, and benefits under chapter 83 (“Retirement”) or chapter 84 (“Federal Employees Retirement System”) of title 5, if necessary employee deductions and agency contributions in payment for coverage, rights, and benefits for the period of employment with the tribal organization are currently deposited in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund ( section 8348 of title 5 ); and the period during which coverage, rights, and benefits are retained under this paragraph is deemed creditable service under section 8332 of title 5 . Days of unused sick leave to the credit of an employee under a formal leave system at the time the employee leaves Federal employment to be employed by a tribal organization remain to his credit for retirement purposes during covered service with the tribal organization.

(3) To retain coverage, rights, and benefits under chapter 89 (“Health Insurance”) of title 5, if necessary employee deductions and agency contributions in payment for the coverage, rights, and benefits for the period of employment with the tribal organization are currently deposited in the Employee’s Health Benefit Fund ( section 8909 of title 5 ); and the period during which coverage, rights, and benefits are retained under this paragraph is deemed service as an employee under chapter 89 of title 5.

(4) To retain coverage, rights, and benefits under chapter 87 (“Life Insurance”) of title 5, if necessary employee deductions and agency contributions in payment for the coverage, rights, and benefits for the period of employment with the tribal organizations are currently deposited in the Employee’s Life Insurance Fund ( section 8714 of title 5 ); and the period during which coverage, rights, and benefits are retained under this paragraph is deemed service as an employee under chapter 87 of title 5.
