### CHAPTER 43— NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION
#### § 4152. Allocation formula
##### (b) Factors for determination of need

The formula shall be based on factors that reflect the need of the Indian tribes and the Indian areas of the tribes for assistance for affordable housing activities, including the following factors:

(1)

(A) The number of low-income housing dwelling units developed under the United States Housing Act of 1937 ( 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.), pursuant to a contract between an Indian housing authority for the tribe and the Secretary, that are owned or operated by a recipient on the October 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year for which funds are provided, subject to the condition that such a unit shall not be considered to be a low-income housing dwelling unit for purposes of this section if

(i) the recipient ceases to possess the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit; or

(ii) the unit is lost to the recipient by conveyance, demolition, or other means.

(B) If the unit is a homeownership unit not conveyed within 25 years from the date of full availability, the recipient shall not be considered to have lost the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit if the unit has not been conveyed to the homebuyer for reasons beyond the control of the recipient.

(C) If the unit is demolished and the recipient rebuilds the unit within 1 year of demolition of the unit, the unit may continue to be considered a low-income housing dwelling unit for the purpose of this paragraph.

(D) In this paragraph, the term “reasons beyond the control of the recipient” means, after making reasonable efforts, there remain

(i) delays in obtaining or the absence of title status reports;

(ii) incorrect or inadequate legal descriptions or other legal documentation necessary for conveyance;

(iii) clouds on title due to probate or intestacy or other court proceedings; or

(iv) any other legal impediment.

(E) Subparagraphs (A) through (D) shall not apply to any claim arising from a formula current assisted stock calculation or count involving an Indian housing block grant allocation for any fiscal year through fiscal year 2008, if a civil action relating to the claim is filed by not later than 45 days after October 14, 2008 .

(2) The extent of poverty and economic distress and the number of Indian families within Indian areas of the tribe.

(3) Other objectively measurable conditions as the Secretary and the Indian tribes may specify.
