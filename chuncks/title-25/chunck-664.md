#### § 1613a. Indian health professions scholarships
##### (b) Recipients; active duty service obligation
######## (D) The Secretary shall provide for the partial or total waiver or suspension of any obligation of service or payment of a recipient of an Indian Health Scholarship if the Secretary determines that

(i) it is not possible for the recipient to meet that obligation or make that payment;

(ii) requiring that recipient to meet that obligation or make that payment would result in extreme hardship to the recipient; or

(iii) the enforcement of the requirement to meet the obligation or make the payment would be unconscionable.

(E) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case of extreme hardship or for other good cause shown, the Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, the right of the United States to recover funds made available under this section.

(F) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to a recipient of an Indian Health Scholarship, no obligation for payment may be released by a discharge in bankruptcy under title 11, unless that discharge is granted after the expiration of the 5-year period beginning on the initial date on which that payment is due, and only if the bankruptcy court finds that the nondischarge of the obligation would be unconscionable.
