##### (g) Compensation or annual salary

(1) In general

(A) Compensation for educators and education positions

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Secretary shall establish the compensation or annual salary rate for educators and education positions

(i) at rates in effect under the General Schedule for individuals with comparable qualifications, and holding comparable positions, to whom chapter 51 of title 5 is applicable; or

(ii) on the basis of the Federal Wage System schedule in effect for the locality involved, and for the comparable positions, at the rates of compensation in effect for the senior executive service.

(B) Compensation or salary for teachers and counselors

(i) In general

The Secretary shall establish the rate of compensation, or annual salary rate, for the positions of teachers and counselors (including dormitory counselors and home-living counselors) at the rate of compensation applicable (on January 8, 2002 , and thereafter) for comparable positions in the overseas schools under the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act [ 20 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].

(ii) Essential provisions

The Secretary shall allow the local school boards involved authority to implement only the aspects of the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act pay provisions that are considered essential for recruitment and retention of teachers and counselors. Implementation of such provisions shall not be construed to require the implementation of that entire Act.

(C) Rates for new hires

(i) In general

Beginning with the first fiscal year following January 8, 2002 , each local school board of a Bureau school may establish a rate of compensation or annual salary rate described in clause (ii) for teachers and counselors (including academic counselors) who are new hires at the school and who had not worked at the school, as of the first day of such fiscal year.

(ii) Consistent rates

The rates established under clause (i) shall be consistent with the rates paid for individuals in the same positions, with the same tenure and training, as the teachers and counselors, in any other school within whose boundaries the Bureau school is located.

(iii) Decreases

In a case in which the establishment of rates under clause (i) causes a reduction in compensation at a school from the rate of compensation that was in effect for the first fiscal year following January 8, 2002 , the new rates of compensation may be applied to the compensation of employees of the school who worked at the school as of January 8, 2002 , by applying those rates at each contract renewal for the employees so that the reduction takes effect in three equal installments.

(iv) Increases

In a case in which adoption of rates under clause (i) leads to an increase in the payment of compensation from that which was in effect for the fiscal year following January 8, 2002 , the school board may make such rates applicable at the next contract renewal such that

(I) the increase occurs in its entirety; or

(II) the increase is applied in three equal installments.

(D) Use of regulations; continued employment of certain educators

The establishment of rates of basic compensation and annual salary rates under subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not

(i) preclude the use of regulations and procedures used by the Bureau prior to April 28, 1988 , in making determinations regarding promotions and advancements through levels of pay that are based on the merit, education, experience, or tenure of the educator; or

(ii) affect the continued employment or compensation of an educator who was employed in an education position on October 31, 1979 , and who did not make an election under subsection (p)  3 as in effect on January 1, 1990 .

(2) Post differential rates

(A) In general

The Secretary may pay a post differential rate, not to exceed 25 percent of the rate of compensation, for educators or education positions, on the basis of conditions of environment or work that warrant additional pay, as a recruitment and retention incentive.

(B) Supervisor’s authority

(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), on the request of the supervisor and the local school board of a Bureau school, the Secretary shall grant the supervisor of the school authorization to provide one or more post differential rates under subparagraph (A).

(ii) Exception

The Secretary shall disapprove, or approve with a modification, a request for authorization to provide a post differential rate if the Secretary determines for clear and convincing reasons (and advises the board in writing of those reasons) that the rate should be disapproved or decreased because the disparity of compensation between the appropriate educators or positions in the Bureau school, and the comparable educators or positions at the nearest public school, is

(I)

(aa) at least 5 percent; or

(bb) less than 5 percent; and

(II) does not affect the recruitment or retention of employees at the school.

(iii) Approval of requests

A request made under clause (i) shall be considered to be approved at the end of the 60th day after the request is received in the Central Office of the Bureau unless before that time the request is approved, approved with a modification, or disapproved by the Secretary.

(iv) Discontinuation of or decrease in rates

The Secretary or the supervisor of a Bureau school may discontinue or decrease a post differential rate provided for under this paragraph at the beginning of an academic year if

(I) the local school board requests that such differential be discontinued or decreased; or

(II) the Secretary or the supervisor, respectively, determines for clear and convincing reasons (and advises the board in writing of those reasons) that there is no disparity of compensation that would affect the recruitment or retention of employees at the school after the differential is discontinued or decreased.

(v) Reports

On or before February 1 of each year, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing the requests and approvals of authorization made under this paragraph during the previous year and listing the positions receiving post differential rates under contracts entered into under those authorizations.
