##### (e) Hazardous condition at Bureau-funded school

(1) Closure, consolidation, or curtailment

(A) In general

A Bureau-funded school may be closed or consolidated, or the programs of a Bureau-funded school may be substantially curtailed, by reason of facility conditions that constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety only if a health and safety officer of the Bureau and an individual designated at the beginning of the school year by the tribe involved under subparagraph (B) determine that such conditions exist at a facility of the Bureau-funded school.

(B) Designation of individual by tribe

To be designated by a tribe for purposes of subparagraph (A), an individual shall

(i) be a licensed or certified facilities safety inspector;

(ii) have demonstrated experience in the inspection of facilities for health and safety purposes with respect to occupancy; or

(iii) have a significant educational background in the health and safety of facilities with respect to occupancy.

(C) Inspection

After making a determination described in subparagraph (A), the Bureau health and safety officer and the individual designated by the tribe shall conduct an inspection of the conditions of such facility in order to determine whether conditions at such facility constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety. Such inspection shall be completed as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 20 days after the date on which the action described in subparagraph (A) is taken.

(D) Failure to concur

If the Bureau health and safety officer, and the individual designated by the tribe, conducting the inspection of a facility required under subparagraph (C) do not concur that conditions at the facility constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, such officer and individual shall immediately notify the tribal governing body and provide written information related to their determinations.

(E) Consideration by tribal governing body

Not later than 10 days after a tribal governing body receives notice under subparagraph (D), the tribal governing body shall consider all information relating to the determinations of the Bureau health and safety officer and the individual designated by the tribe and make a determination regarding the closure, consolidation, or curtailment involved.

(F) Agreement to close, consolidate, or curtail

(i) In general

If the Bureau health and safety officer and the individual designated by the tribe conducting the inspection of a facility required under subparagraph (C), concur that conditions at the facility constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, or if the tribal governing body makes such a determination under subparagraph (E), the facility involved shall be closed immediately.

(ii) Reopening of facility if no immediate hazard found to exist

If the Bureau health and safety officer or the individual designated by the tribe conducting the inspection of a facility required under subparagraph (C) determines that conditions at the facility do not constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, any consolidation or curtailment that was made under this paragraph shall immediately cease and any school closed by reason of conditions at the facility shall be reopened immediately.

(G) General closure report

If a Bureau-funded school is temporarily closed or consolidated or the programs of a Bureau-funded school are temporarily substantially curtailed under this subsection and the Secretary determines that the closure, consolidation, or curtailment will exceed 1 year, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, the affected tribe, and the local school board, not later than 90 days after the date on which the closure, consolidation, or curtailment was initiated, a report that specifies

(i) the reasons for such temporary action;

(ii) the actions the Secretary is taking to eliminate the conditions that constitute the hazard;

(iii) an estimated date by which the actions described in clause (ii) will be concluded; and

(iv) a plan for providing alternate education services for students enrolled at the school that is to be closed.

(2) Nonapplication of certain standards for temporary facility use

(A) Classroom activities

The Secretary shall permit the local school board to temporarily utilize facilities adjacent to the school, or satellite facilities, if such facilities are suitable for conducting classroom activities. In permitting the use of facilities under the preceding sentence, the Secretary may waive applicable minor standards under section 2001 of this title relating to such facilities (such as the required number of exit lights or configuration of restrooms) so long as such waivers do not result in the creation of an environment that constitutes an immediate and substantial threat to the health, safety, and life of students and staff.

(B) Administrative activities

The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall apply with respect to administrative personnel if the facilities involved are suitable for activities performed by such personnel.

(C) Temporary

In this paragraph, the term “temporary” means

(i) with respect to a school that is to be closed for not more than 1 year, 3 months or less; and

(ii) with respect to a school that is to be closed for not less than 1 year, a time period determined appropriate by the Bureau.

(3) Treatment of closure

Any closure of a Bureau-funded school under this subsection for a period that exceeds 30 days but is less than 1 year, shall be treated by the Bureau as an emergency facility improvement and repair project.

(4) Use of funds

With respect to a Bureau-funded school that is closed under this subsection, the tribal governing body, or the designated local school board of each Bureau-funded school, involved may authorize the use of funds allocated pursuant to section 2007 of this title , to abate the hazardous conditions without further action by Congress.
