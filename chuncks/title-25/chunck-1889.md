### CHAPTER 34— INDIAN CHILD PROTECTION AND FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION
#### § 3201. Findings and purpose
##### (a) Findings

The Congress, after careful review of the problem of child abuse on Indian reservations and the historical and special relationship of the Federal Government with Indian people,

(1) finds that

(A) incidents of abuse of children on Indian reservations are grossly underreported;

(B) such underreporting is often a result of the lack of a mandatory Federal reporting law;

(C) multiple incidents of sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations have been perpetrated by persons employed or funded by the Federal Government;

(D) Federal Government investigations of the background of Federal employees who care for, or teach, Indian children are often deficient;

(E) funds spent by the United States on Indian reservations or otherwise spent for the benefit of Indians who are victims of child abuse or family violence are inadequate to meet the growing needs for mental health treatment and counseling for victims of child abuse or family violence and their families; and

(F) there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for membership in, an Indian tribe; and

(2) declares that two major goals of the United States are to

(A) identify the scope of incidents of abuse of children and family violence in Indian country and to reduce such incidents; and

(B) provide funds for mental health treatment for Indian victims of child abuse and family violence on Indian reservations.
