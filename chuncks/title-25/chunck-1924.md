### CHAPTER 34— INDIAN CHILD PROTECTION AND FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION
#### § 3210. Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Program
##### (f) 2 Secretarial regulations; base support funding

(1) The Secretary, with the participation of Indian tribes, shall establish, and promulgate by regulations, a formula which establishes base support funding for Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention programs.

(2) In the development of regulations for base support funding for such programs, the Secretary shall develop, in consultation with Indian tribes, appropriate caseload standards and staffing requirements which are comparable to standards developed by the National Association of Social Work, the Child Welfare League of America and other professional associations in the field of social work and child welfare. Each level of funding assistance shall correspond to the staffing requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to this section.

(3) Factors to be considered in the development of the base support funding formula shall include, but are not limited to

(A) projected service population of the program;

(B) projected service area of the program;

(C) projected number of cases per month; and

(D) special circumstances warranting additional program resources, such as high incidence of child sexual abuse, high incidence of violent crimes against women, or the existence of a significant victim population within the community.

(4) The formula established pursuant to this subsection shall provide funding necessary to support

(A) one child protective services or family violence caseworker, including fringe benefits and support costs, for each tribe; and

(B) an additional child protective services and family violence caseworker, including fringe benefits and support costs, for each level of assistance for which an Indian tribe qualifies.

(5) In any fiscal year that appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention programs at each level of assistance under the formula required to be established in this subsection, available funds for each level of assistance shall be evenly divided among the tribes qualifying for that level of assistance.
