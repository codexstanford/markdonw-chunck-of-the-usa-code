(5) To develop Indian agricultural lands and associated value-added industries of Indians and Indian tribes to promote self-sustaining communities.

(6) To assist trust and restricted Indian landowners in leasing their agricultural lands for a reasonable annual return, consistent with prudent management and conservation practices, and community goals as expressed in the tribal management plans and appropriate tribal ordinances.
