##### (b) Exception

An appropriate Federal banking agency may except an identified banking product of a bank under its regulatory jurisdiction from the exclusion in subsection (a) if the agency determines, in consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, that the product

(2) has become known to the trade as a swap or security-based swap, or otherwise has been structured as an identified banking product for the purpose of evading the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Securities Act of 1933 ( 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
