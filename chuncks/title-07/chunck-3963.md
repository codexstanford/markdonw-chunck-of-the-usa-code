#### § 3124a. Federal-State partnership and coordination
##### (c) Designation of State cooperative institutions; reports; research grants

(1) To promote research for purposes of developing agricultural policy alternatives, the Secretary is encouraged

(A) to designate at least one State cooperative institution to conduct research in an interdisciplinary fashion; and

(B) to report on a regular basis with respect to the effect of emerging technological, economic, sociological, and environmental developments on the structure of agriculture.

(2) Support for this effort should include grants to examine the role of various food production, processing, and distribution systems that may primarily benefit small- and medium-sized family farms, such as diversified farm plans, energy, water, and soil conservation technologies, direct and cooperative marketing, production and processing cooperatives, and rural community resource management.
