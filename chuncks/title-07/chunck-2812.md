#### § 2001. Debt restructuring and loan servicing
##### (c) Restructuring determinations

(1) Determination of net recovery

In determining the net recovery from the involuntary liquidation of a loan under this section, the Secretary shall calculate

(A) the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan, in accordance with paragraph (2); and

(B) the value of the restructured loan, in accordance with paragraph (3).

(2) Recovery value

For the purpose of paragraph (1), the recovery value of the collateral securing the loan shall be based on

(A)

(i) the amount of the current appraised value of the interests of the borrower in the property securing the loan; plus

(ii) the value of the interests of the borrower in all other assets that are

(I) not essential for necessary family living expenses;

(II) not essential to the operation of the farm; and

(III) not exempt from judgment creditors or in a bankruptcy action under Federal or State law; less

(B) the estimated administrative, legal, and other expenses associated with the liquidation and disposition of the loan and collateral, including

(i) the payment of prior liens;

(ii) taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, the yearly percentage decrease or increase in the value of the property, and lost interest income, each calculated for the average holding period for the type of property involved;

(iii) resale expenses, such as repairs, commissions, and advertising; and

(iv) other administrative and attorney’s costs; plus

(C) the value, as determined by the Secretary, of any property not included in subparagraph (A)(i) if the property is specified in any security agreement with respect to such loan and the Secretary determines that the value of such property should be included for purposes of this section.

(3) Value of the restructured loan

(A) In general

For the purpose of paragraph (1), the value of the restructured loan shall be based on the present value of payments that the borrower would make to the Federal Government if the terms of such loan were modified under any combination of primary loan service programs to ensure that the borrower is able to meet such obligations and continue farming operations.

(B) Present value

For the purpose of calculating the present value referred to in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use a discount rate of not more than the current rate on 90-day Treasury bills.

(C) Cash flow margin

For the purpose of assessing under subparagraph (A) the ability of a borrower to meet debt obligations and continue farming operations, the Secretary shall assume that the borrower needs up to 110 percent of the amount indicated for payment of farm operating expenses, debt service obligations, and family living expenses.

(4) Notification

Within 90 days after receipt of a written request for restructuring from the borrower, the Secretary shall

(A) make the calculations specified in paragraphs (2) and (3);

(B) notify the borrower in writing of the results of such calculations; and

(C) provide documentation for the calculations.

(5) Restructuring of loans

If the value of the restructured loan is greater than or equal to the recovery value, the Secretary shall, within 45 days after notifying the borrower of such calculations, offer to restructure the loan obligations of the borrower under this chapter through primary loan service programs that would enable the borrower to meet the obligations (as modified) under the loan and to continue the farming operations of the borrower. If the borrower accepts such offer, within 45 days after receipt of notice of acceptance, the Secretary shall restructure the loan accordingly.

(6) Termination of loan obligations

The obligations of a borrower to the Secretary under a loan shall terminate if

(A) the borrower satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b);

(B) the value of the restructured loan is less than the recovery value; and

(C) not later than 90 days after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (4)(B), the borrower pays (or obtains third-party financing to pay) the Secretary an amount equal to the current market value.

(7) Negotiation of appraisal

(A) In general

In making a determination concerning restructuring under this subsection, the Secretary, at the request of the borrower, shall enter into negotiations concerning appraisals required under this subsection with the borrower.

(B) Independent appraisal

If the borrower, based on a separate current appraisal, objects to the decision of the Secretary regarding an appraisal, the borrower and the Secretary shall mutually agree, to the extent practicable, on an independent appraiser who shall conduct another appraisal of the borrower’s property. The average of the two appraisals that are closest in value shall become the final appraisal under this paragraph. The borrower and the Secretary shall each pay one-half of the cost of the independent appraisal.
