### CHAPTER 96— GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
#### § 6702. Study of global climate change, agriculture, and forestry
##### (b) Forests

The Secretary shall conduct a study on the emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrocarbons from tropical and temperate forests, the manner in which such emissions may affect global climate change; the manner in which global climate change may affect such emissions; and the manner in which such emissions may be reduced through management practices. The study shall, at a minimum

(1) obtain measurements of nitrous oxide, methane, and nonmethane hydrocarbons from tropical and temperate forests;

(2) determine the manner in which the nitrous oxide, methane, and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions from temperate and tropical forest systems will respond due to climate change; and

(3) identify and address alternative management strategies for temperate and tropical forests that may mitigate any negative effects of global climate change.
