### CHAPTER 57— PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION
#### § 2401. Definitions and rules of construction
##### (a) Definitions

As used in this chapter:

(1) Asexually reproduced

The term “asexually reproduced” means produced by a method of plant propagation using vegetative material (other than seed) from a single parent, including cuttings, grafting, tissue culture, and propagation by root division.

(2) Basic seed

The term “basic seed” means the seed planted to produce certified or commercial seed.

(3) Breeder

The term “breeder” means the person who directs the final breeding creating a variety or who discovers and develops a variety. If the actions are conducted by an agent on behalf of a principal, the principal, rather than the agent, shall be considered the breeder. The term does not include a person who redevelops or rediscovers a variety the existence of which is publicly known or a matter of common knowledge.

(4) Essentially derived variety

(A) In general

The term “essentially derived variety” means a variety that

(i) is predominantly derived from another variety (referred to in this paragraph as the “initial variety”) or from a variety that is predominantly derived from the initial variety, while retaining the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial variety;

(ii) is clearly distinguishable from the initial variety; and

(iii) except for differences that result from the act of derivation, conforms to the initial variety in the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial variety.

(B) Methods

An essentially derived variety may be obtained by the selection of a natural or induced mutant or of a somaclonal variant, the selection of a variant individual from plants of the initial variety, backcrossing, transformation by genetic engineering, or other method.

(5) Kind

The term “kind” means one or more related species or subspecies singly or collectively known by one common name, such as soybean, flax, or radish.

(6) Seed

The term “seed”, with respect to a tuber propagated variety, means the tuber or the part of the tuber used for propagation.

(7) Sexually reproduced

The term “sexually reproduced” includes any production of a variety by seed, but does not include the production of a variety by tuber propagation.

(8) Tuber propagated

The term “tuber propagated” means propagated by a tuber or a part of a tuber.

(9) United States

The terms “United States” and “this country” mean the United States, the territories and possessions of the United States, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

(10) Variety

The term “variety” means a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, that, without regard to whether the conditions for plant variety protection are fully met, can be defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype or combination of genotypes, distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of at least one characteristic and considered as a unit with regard to the suitability of the plant grouping for being propagated unchanged. A variety may be represented by seed, transplants, plants, tubers, tissue culture plantlets, and other matter.
