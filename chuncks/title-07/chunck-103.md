##### (e) Appointment of trustee

(1) In general

If a proceeding under section 7b of this title results in the suspension or revocation of the registration of a derivatives clearing organization, or if a derivatives clearing organization withdraws from registration, the Commission, on notice to the derivatives clearing organization, may apply to the appropriate United States district court where the derivatives clearing organization is located for the appointment of a trustee.

If the Commission applies for appointment of a trustee under paragraph (1)

(A) the court may take exclusive jurisdiction over the derivatives clearing organization and the records and assets of the derivatives clearing organization, wherever located; and

(B) if the court takes jurisdiction under subparagraph (A), the court shall appoint the Commission, or a person designated by the Commission, as trustee with power to take possession and continue to operate or terminate the operations of the derivatives clearing organization in an orderly manner for the protection of participants, subject to such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe.
