##### (c) Financial assistance for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems

(1) In general

(A) Assistance

In addition to any similar authority, the Secretary shall provide

(i) loan guarantees and grants to agricultural producers and rural small businesses

(I) to purchase renewable energy systems, including systems that may be used to produce and sell electricity; and

(II) to make energy efficiency improvements; and

(ii) loan guarantees to agricultural producers to purchase and install energy efficient equipment or systems for agricultural production or processing that exceed

(I) energy efficiency building codes, if applicable;

(II) Federal or State energy efficiency standards, if applicable; and

(III) other energy efficiency standards determined appropriate by the Secretary.

(B) Limitations

With respect to loan guarantees under subparagraph (A)(ii)

(i) if no codes or standards described in such subparagraph apply to the energy efficient equipment or system to be purchased or installed pursuant to such subparagraph, the Secretary shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, such equipment or system to meet the same efficiency measurements as the most efficient available equipment or system in the market; and

(ii) the Secretary shall not provide such a loan guarantee for the purchase or installation of any energy efficient equipment or system unless more than one type of such equipment or system is available in the market.

(2) Award considerations

In determining the amount of a loan guarantee or grant provided under this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration, as applicable

(A) the type of renewable energy system to be purchased;

(B) the estimated quantity of energy to be generated by the renewable energy system;

(C) the expected environmental benefits of the renewable energy system;

(D) the quantity of energy savings expected to be derived from the activity, as demonstrated by an energy audit;

(E) the estimated period of time for the energy savings generated by the activity to equal the cost of the activity;

(F) the expected energy efficiency of the renewable energy system; and

(G) other appropriate factors.

(3) Limits

(A) Grants

The amount of a grant under this subsection shall not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the activity carried out using funds from the grant.

(B) Maximum amount of loan guarantees

(C) Maximum amount of combined grant and loan guarantee

The combined amount of a grant and loan guaranteed under this subsection shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of the activity funded under this subsection.

(D) Loan guarantees for energy efficient equipment to agricultural producers

Using funds made available under paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (f), in each fiscal year the Secretary may use for loan guarantees under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) an amount that does not exceed 15 percent of such funds.

(4) Tiered application process

(C) Tier 2

The Secretary shall establish a separate application process for projects for which the cost of the activity funded under this subsection is greater than $80,000 but less than $200,000.

(D) Tier 3

The Secretary shall establish a separate application process for projects for which the cost of the activity funded under this subsection is equal to or greater than $200,000.

(E) Application process

The Secretary shall establish an application, evaluation, and oversight process that is the most simplified for tier I projects and more comprehensive for each subsequent tier.
