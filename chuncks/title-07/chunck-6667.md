(2) would be carried out in a location with limited access to natural gas pipelines;

(3) would include the use or retrofitting (or both) of existing sawmill facilities located in a location where the average annual unemployment rate exceeded the national average unemployment rate by more than 1 percent during the previous calendar year; or
