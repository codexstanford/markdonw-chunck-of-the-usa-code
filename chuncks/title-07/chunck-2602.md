(ii) Exception .

Clause (i) does not apply to a loan for a specific project that is the subject of a loan that has been approved, but not closed, as of the date of enactment of this subparagraph.

(4) Except as provided in paragraph (6), the interest rates on loans under sections 1926(a)(1) and 1932 of this title (other than guaranteed loans and loans as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection) shall be as determined by the Secretary, but not less than such rates as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for rates comparable to the rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and considering the Secretary’s insurance of the loans, plus an additional charge, prescribed by the Secretary, to cover the Secretary’s losses and cost of administration, which charge shall be deposited in the Rural Development Insurance Fund, and further adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.

(5)

(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the interest rate on any loan made under this subchapter as a guaranteed loan shall be such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the lender, but not in excess of a rate as may be determined by the Secretary.

(B) In the case of a loan made under section 1932 of this title as a guaranteed loan, subparagraph (A) shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution or laws of any State limiting the rate or amount of interest that may be charged, taken, received, or reserved.

(6)

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of loans (other than guaranteed loans) made or insured under the authorities of this chapter specified in subparagraph (B) for activities that involve the use of prime farmland as defined in subparagraph (C), the interest rates shall be the interest rates otherwise applicable under this section increased by 2 per centum per annum. Wherever practicable, construction by a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of local government that is supported by loans described in the preceding sentence shall be placed on land that is not prime farmland, in order to preserve the maximum practicable amount of prime farmlands for production of food and fiber. Where other options exist for the siting of such construction and where the governmental authority still desires to carry out such construction on prime farmland, the 2 per centum interest rate increase provided by this clause shall apply, but such increased interest rate shall not apply where such other options do not exist.
