##### (d) Treatment of certain contracts and agreements

(1) Effect of purchase contract

If there was an agreement for the purchase of all or part of a farm described in subsection (c) as of October 22, 2004 , and the parties to the sale are unable to agree to the disposition of eligibility for contract payments, the Secretary, taking into account any transfer of quota that has been agreed to, shall provide for the equitable division of the contract payments among the parties by adjusting the determination of who is the tobacco quota holder with respect to particular pounds or allotment of the quota.

(2) Effect of agreement for permanent quota transfer

If the Secretary determines that there was in existence, as of the day before October 22, 2004 , an agreement for the permanent transfer of quota, but that the transfer was not completed by that date, the Secretary shall consider the tobacco quota holder to be the party to the agreement that, as of that date, was the owner of the farm to which the quota was to be transferred.
