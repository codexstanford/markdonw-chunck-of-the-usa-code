##### (b) Loan proceeds; time for receipt

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if an application for an insured loan under this chapter is approved by the Secretary, the Secretary shall provide the loan proceeds to the applicant not later than 15 days (or such longer period as the applicant may approve) after the application for the loan is approved by the Secretary.

(2) If the Secretary is unable to provide the loan proceeds to the applicant within such 15-day period because sufficient funds are not available to the Secretary for such purpose, the Secretary shall provide the loan proceeds to the applicant as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 15 days unless the applicant agrees to a longer period) after sufficient funds for such purpose become available to the Secretary.
