#### § 6304. Required terms in orders
##### (b) Establishment and membership of United Soybean Board

(1) In general

The order shall provide for the establishment of, and appointment of members to, a United Soybean Board to administer the order. Members of the Board shall be soybean producers appointed by the Secretary, on a geographic basis, from State or combined units, as provided in this subsection. The cumulative number of seats on the Board shall be the total number of seats to which all the units are entitled.

(2) Seats

The Secretary shall establish State units and combined units and seats on the Board for such units, as follows:

(A) State units

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each State shall be considered as a unit.

(B) Combined units

A State in which average annual soybean production is less than 3,000,000 bushels shall be grouped with other States into a combined unit. To the extent practicable, each State with average annual soybean production of less than 3,000,000 bushels shall be grouped with other States with average annual soybean production of less than 3,000,000 bushels into a combined unit, in a manner prescribed in the order, and each combined unit shall consist of geographically contiguous States. To the extent practicable, each combined unit shall have an average annual production of soybeans of at least 3,000,000 bushels.

(C) Number of seats per unit

Subject to subparagraph (F), each unit, as established under subparagraph (A) or (B)

(i) if its average annual soybean production is less than 15,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to one seat on the Board;

(ii) if its average annual soybean production is 15,000,000 bushels or more but less than 70,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to 2 seats on the Board;

(iii) if its average annual soybean production is 70,000,000 bushels or more but less than 200,000,000 bushels, shall be entitled to 3 seats on the Board; and

(iv) if its average annual soybean production is 200,000,000 bushels or more, shall be entitled to 4 seats on the Board.

(D) Determination of average annual soybean production

For purposes of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (F), the Secretary shall determine average annual soybean production applicable to a crop year by using the average of the 5 previous crops of soybeans, excluding the crop in which production was the highest and the crop in which production was the lowest.

(E) Reapportionment of seats

At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Secretary, if necessary, shall adjust any unit to conform with subparagraphs (A) and (B). If the Secretary makes such an adjustment, the Secretary shall reapportion the seats on the Board to conform with subparagraph (C) and any modifications made under subparagraph (F). If payment of refunds following the initial referendum conducted under section 6305(a) of this title is authorized by producers, in making such adjustments, the Secretary shall exclude, from each State’s annual soybean production, those bushels of soybeans on which such refunds are paid.

(F) Adjustment of levels of production

At the end of each 3 year period beginning with the 3 year period starting on the effective date of the order, the Board may recommend to the Secretary, to the extent it determines appropriate, changes in the levels of production used in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to determine per-unit representation on the Board. The Secretary may amend the order to make such changes in levels of production used to determine per-unit representation. Any such amendment to the order shall not be subject to a referendum of producers. A unit may not, as a result of any modification under this subparagraph, lose Board seats to which it is entitled at the time the order is initially issued unless its average annual production, as determined under subparagraph (D), declines below the levels required for representation, as specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C).

(3) Nominations

(A) In general

The Secretary shall appoint soybean producers to seats established under paragraph (2) from nominations submitted by each unit. Each unit shall submit to the Secretary at least two nominations for each appointment to the Board to which the unit is entitled, as determined under paragraph (2).

(B) Method for obtaining nominations

(i) Initially-established Board

(I) State units

The Secretary shall solicit nominations for each seat on the initially-established Board to which a State unit is entitled from the State soybean board in the State that submits satisfactory evidence to the Secretary that such board meets the criteria of subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 6302(14) of this title . If no such organization exists in the unit, the Secretary shall solicit nominations for appointments in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(II) Combined units

The Secretary shall solicit nominations for each seat on the initially-established Board to which a combined unit is entitled in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the recommendations of any State soybean board operating in the unit that submits to the Secretary satisfactory evidence that such board meets the criteria described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 6302(14) of this title .

(ii) Subsequent appointment

(I) State units

Nominations for each subsequent appointment to a seat on the Board to which a State unit is entitled shall be made by the qualified State soybean board in the unit. If no such organization exists in the unit, the Secretary shall solicit nominations for such appointment in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(II) Combined units

The Secretary shall solicit nominations for each subsequent appointment to the Board to which a combined unit is entitled in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into consideration the recommendations of any qualified State soybean board operating in the unit.

(iii) Rejection

The Secretary may reject any nomination submitted by a unit under this paragraph. If there are insufficient nominations from which to appoint members to the Board as a result of the Secretary rejecting the nominations submitted by a unit, the unit shall submit additional nominations, as provided in this paragraph.

(4) Terms

Each appointment to the Board shall be for a term of 3 years, except that appointments to the initially-established Board shall be proportionately for 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year terms. No person may serve more than three consecutive 3-year terms.

(5) Compensation

Board members shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties as members of the Board.

(6) Temporary appointments

(A) Appointment

Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (5), the Secretary, under procedures established by the Secretary, shall appoint to the initially-established Board up to three temporary members to serve in addition to the members appointed as otherwise provided in this subsection, as the Secretary determines appropriate for transition purposes under the criteria set out in subparagraph (B). Each such temporary member shall be appointed for a single term not to exceed 3 years.

(B) Representation of certain States

The Secretary shall make temporary appointments to the initially-established Board to ensure, to the extent practicable, that each State with a State soybean board that, prior to November 28, 1990 , was contributing State soybean promotion and research assessment funds to national soybean promotion and research efforts has representation on the initially-established Board that reflects the relative contributions of such State to the national soybean promotion and research effort.

(7) Meetings

The order shall provide for at least one meeting of the Board annually and specify the circumstances under which additional special meetings of the Board may be held.
