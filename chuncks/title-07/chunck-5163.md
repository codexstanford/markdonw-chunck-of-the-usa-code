#### § 6304. Required terms in orders
##### (d) Board voting procedures

(1) In general

The order shall establish procedures for the conduct of voting by the Board, as provided in this subsection. On or after the end of the 3-year period beginning on the effective date of the order, the Board may recommend to the Secretary changes in the voting procedures of the Board and the Secretary may amend the order to make such changes. Such changes shall not be subject to a referendum of producers.

(2) Number of votes per member

Each member of the Board shall be entitled, in any vote conducted by the Board, to cast the number of votes determined under the following rules:

(A) In general

Each member shall be entitled to cast one vote unless a roll call vote is conducted. On a roll call vote, each member shall be entitled to cast such additional votes as are assigned to the member under subparagraph (B).

(B) Additional votes

The additional votes that each member is assigned for roll call votes shall be computed as follows:

(i) Assessment level

Except as provided in clause (ii), each unit shall be allotted one vote for each percent, or portion of a percent, of the total amount of assessments remitted to the Board that was remitted from the unit (net of any refunds made under subsection ( l )(2)), on the average, during each of the 3 previous fiscal years of the Board.

(ii) First three fiscal years

(I) First fiscal year

During the first fiscal year of the Board, each unit shall be allotted one vote for each percent, or portion of a percent, of the total production of soybeans in the United States that was produced in the unit, on the average, during each of the 3 immediately preceding crop years.

(II) Second and third fiscal years

The order shall provide appropriate adjustments of the procedure for the allotment of votes under clause (i) to apply to allotments of votes during the second and third fiscal years of the Board.

(iii) Division of votes within units

A unit’s total votes under clause (i) or (ii) shall be divided equally among all the members present and voting representing that unit. The procedures established by the order shall provide for the equitable disposition of fractional votes assigned to a member under such division of a unit’s vote.

(3) Motions

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a motion shall carry if approved by a simple majority of members of the Board casting votes.

Any member of the Board may call for a roll call vote on any motion. Except as otherwise provided in the bylaws adopted by the Board, whenever a roll call vote is conducted, the motion shall carry only if it is approved by a simple majority of all votes cast and a simple majority of all units voting (with the vote of each unit determined by a simple majority of all votes cast by members in that unit).

(4) Committee votes

In any vote conducted by a committee of the Board, each member of the committee shall have one vote.

(5) Proxies

A member may not cast votes by proxy.
