### CHAPTER 51— SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
#### § 2018. Approval of retail food stores and wholesale food concerns
##### (d) Hearing upon failure of applicant to receive approval; waiting period for new application

Any retail food store or wholesale food concern which has failed upon application to receive approval to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program may obtain a hearing on such refusal as provided in section 2023 of this title . A retail food store or wholesale food concern that is denied approval to accept and redeem benefits because the store or concern does not meet criteria for approval established by the Secretary may not, for at least 6 months, submit a new application to participate in the program. The Secretary may establish a longer time period under the preceding sentence, including permanent disqualification, that reflects the severity of the basis of the denial.
