### CHAPTER 6— INSECTICIDES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PESTICIDE CONTROL
#### § 136. Definitions
##### (ll) Minor use

The term “minor use” means the use of a pesticide on an animal, on a commercial agricultural crop or site, or for the protection of public health where

(1) the total United States acreage for the crop is less than 300,000 acres, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture; or

(2) the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, determines that, based on information provided by an applicant for registration or a registrant, the use does not provide sufficient economic incentive to support the initial registration or continuing registration of a pesticide for such use and

(A) there are insufficient efficacious alternative registered pesticides available for the use;

(B) the alternatives to the pesticide use pose greater risks to the environment or human health;

(C) the minor use pesticide plays or will play a significant part in managing pest resistance; or

(D) the minor use pesticide plays or will play a significant part in an integrated pest management program. The status as a minor use under this subsection shall continue as long as the Administrator has not determined that, based on existing data, such use may cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment and the use otherwise qualifies for such status.
