### CHAPTER 1— COMMODITY EXCHANGES
#### § 1b. Requirements of Secretary of the Treasury regarding exemption of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from definition of the term “swap”
##### (a) Required considerations

In determining whether to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of the term “swap”, the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the “Secretary”) shall consider

(1) whether the required trading and clearing of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards would create systemic risk, lower transparency, or threaten the financial stability of the United States;

(2) whether foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are already subject to a regulatory scheme that is materially comparable to that established by this chapter for other classes of swaps;

(3) the extent to which bank regulators of participants in the foreign exchange market provide adequate supervision, including capital and margin requirements;

(4) the extent of adequate payment and settlement systems; and

(5) the use of a potential exemption of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards to evade otherwise applicable regulatory requirements.
