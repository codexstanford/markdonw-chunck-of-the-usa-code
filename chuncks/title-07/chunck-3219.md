#### § 2025. Administrative cost-sharing and quality control
##### (c) Quality control system

(1) In general

(A) System

(i) In general

In carrying out the supplemental nutrition assistance program, the Secretary shall carry out a system that enhances payment accuracy and improves administration by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high payment error rates to share in the cost of payment error.

(ii) Tolerance level for excluding small errors

The Secretary shall set the tolerance level for excluding small errors for the purposes of this subsection

(I) for fiscal year 2014, at an amount not greater than $37; and

(II) for each fiscal year thereafter, the amount specified in subclause (I) adjusted by the percentage by which the thrifty food plan is adjusted under section 2012(u)(4) of this title between June 30, 2013 , and June 30 of the immediately preceding fiscal year.

(B) Quality control system integrity

(i) In general

Not later than 180 days after December 20, 2018 , the Secretary shall issue interim final regulations that

(I) ensure that the quality control system established under this subsection produces valid statistical results;

(II) provide for oversight of contracts entered into by a State agency for the purpose of improving payment accuracy;

(III) ensure the accuracy of data collected under the quality control system established under this subsection; and

(IV) for each fiscal year, to the maximum extent practicable, provide for the evaluation of the integrity of the quality control process of not fewer than 2 State agencies, selected in accordance with criteria determined by the Secretary.

(ii) Debarment

In accordance with the nonprocurement debarment procedures under part 417 of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations, or successor regulations, the Secretary shall debar any person that, in carrying out the quality control system established under this subsection, knowingly submits, or causes to be submitted, false information to the Secretary.

(C) Establishment of liability amount for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter

With respect to fiscal year 2004 and any fiscal year thereafter for which the Secretary determines that, for the second or subsequent consecutive fiscal year, a 95 percent statistical probability exists that the payment error rate of a State agency exceeds 105 percent of the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), the Secretary shall establish an amount for which the State agency may be liable (referred to in this paragraph as the “liability amount”) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying

(i) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year;

(ii) the difference between

(I) the payment error rate of the State agency; and

(II) 6 percent; and

(iii) 10 percent.

(D) Authority of Secretary with respect to liability amount

With respect to the liability amount established for a State agency under subparagraph (C) for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall

(i)

(I) require that a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the liability amount established for the fiscal year be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program (referred to in this paragraph as the “new investment amount”), which new investment amount shall not be matched by Federal funds;

(II) designate a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the amount established for the fiscal year for payment to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (E) (referred to in this paragraph as the “at-risk amount”); or

(III) take any combination of the actions described in subclauses (I) and (II); or

(ii) make the determinations described in clause (i) and enter into a settlement with the State agency, only with respect to any new investment amount, before the end of the fiscal year in which the liability amount is determined under subparagraph (C).

(E) Payment of at-risk amount for certain States

(i) In general

A State agency shall pay to the Secretary the at-risk amount designated under subparagraph (D)(i)(II) for any fiscal year in accordance with clause (ii), if, with respect to the immediately following fiscal year, a liability amount has been established for the State agency under subparagraph (C).

(ii) Method of payment of at-risk amount

(I) Remission to the Secretary

In the case of a State agency required to pay an at-risk amount under clause (i), as soon as practicable after completion of all administrative and judicial reviews with respect to that requirement to pay, the chief executive officer of the State shall remit to the Secretary the at-risk amount required to be paid.

(II) Alternative method of collection

(aa) In general

If the chief executive officer of the State fails to make the payment under subclause (I) within a reasonable period of time determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the amount required to be paid under clause (i).

(bb) Accrual of interest

During any period of time determined by the Secretary under item (aa), interest on the payment under subclause (I) shall not accrue under section 2022(a)(2) of this title .

(F) Use of portion of liability amount for new investment

(i) Reduction of other amounts due to State agency

In the case of a State agency that fails to comply with a requirement for new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(I) or clause (iii)(I), the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the portion of the liability amount that has not been used in accordance with that requirement.

(ii) Effect of State agency’s wholly prevailing on appeal

If a State agency begins required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(I), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is reduced to $0 on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of the new investment amount that was included in the liability amount subject to the appeal.

(iii) Effect of Secretary’s wholly prevailing on appeal

If a State agency does not begin required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(I), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is wholly upheld on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall

(I) require all or any portion of the new investment amount to be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which amount shall not be matched by Federal funds; and

(II) require payment of any remaining portion of the new investment amount in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii).

(iv) Effect of neither party’s wholly prevailing on appeal

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations regarding obligations of the Secretary and the State agency in a case in which the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency and neither the Secretary nor the State agency wholly prevails.

(G) Corrective action plans

The Secretary shall foster management improvements by the States by requiring State agencies, other than State agencies with payment error rates of less than 6 percent, to develop and implement corrective action plans to reduce payment errors.

(2) Error rate definitions

As used in this section

(A) the term “payment error rate” means the sum of the point estimates of an overpayment error rate and an underpayment error rate determined by the Secretary from data collected in a probability sample of participating households;

(B) the term “overpayment error rate” means the percentage of the value of all allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency that are either

(i) issued to households that fail to meet basic program eligibility requirements; or

(ii) overissued to eligible households; and

(C) the term “underpayment error rate” means the ratio of the value of allotments underissued to recipient households to the total value of allotments issued in a fiscal year by a State agency.

(3) Exclusions

(A) Any errors resulting in the application of new regulations promulgated under this chapter during the first 120 days from the required implementation date for such regulations.

(B) Errors resulting from the use by a State agency of correctly processed information concerning households or individuals received from Federal agencies or from actions based on policy information approved or disseminated, in writing, by the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee.

(4) Reporting requirements

The Secretary may require a State agency to report any factors that the Secretary considers necessary, including providing access to applicable State records and the entire information systems in which the records are contained, to determine a State agency’s payment error rate, liability amount or new investment amount under paragraph (1), or performance under the performance measures under subsection (d). If a State agency fails to meet the reporting requirements established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall base the determination on all pertinent information available to the Secretary.

(5) Procedures

To facilitate the implementation of this subsection, each State agency shall expeditiously submit to the Secretary data concerning the operations of the State agency in each fiscal year sufficient for the Secretary to establish the State agency’s payment error rate, liability amount or new investment amount under paragraph (1), or performance under the performance measures under subsection (d). The Secretary shall initiate efforts to collect the amount owed by the State agency as a claim established under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, subject to the conclusion of any formal or informal appeal procedure and administrative or judicial review under section 2023 of this title (as provided for in paragraph (7)), before the end of the fiscal year following such fiscal year.

(6) National performance measure for payment error rates

(A) Announcement

At the time the Secretary makes the notification to State agencies of their error rates, the Secretary shall also announce a national performance measure that shall be the sum of the products of each State agency’s error rate as developed for the notifications under paragraph (8) times that State agency’s proportion of the total value of national allotments issued for the fiscal year using the most recent issuance data available at the time of the notifications issued pursuant to paragraph (8).

(B) Use of alternative measure of State error

Where a State fails to meet reporting requirements pursuant to paragraph (4), the Secretary may use another measure of a State’s error developed pursuant to paragraph (5), to develop the national performance measure.

(B) Determination of payment error rate

With respect to any fiscal year, a determination of the payment error rate of a State agency or a determination whether the payment error rate exceeds 105 percent of the national performance measure for payment error rates shall be subject to administrative or judicial review only if the Secretary establishes a liability amount with respect to the fiscal year under paragraph (1)(C).
