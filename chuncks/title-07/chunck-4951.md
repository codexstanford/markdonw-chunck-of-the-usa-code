##### (g) Pollinator protection

(1) Research and extension

(A) Grants

Research and extension grants may be made under this section

(i) to survey and collect data on bee colony production and health;

(ii) to investigate pollinator biology, immunology, ecology, genomics, and bioinformatics;

(iii) to conduct research on various factors that may be contributing to or associated with colony collapse disorder, and other serious threats to the health of honey bees and other pollinators, including

(I) parasites and pathogens of pollinators; and

(II) the sublethal effects of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides on honey bees and native and managed pollinators;

(iv) to develop mitigative and preventative measures to improve native and managed pollinator health; and

(v) to promote the health of honey bees and native pollinators through habitat conservation and best management practices.

(B) Authorization of appropriations

There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this paragraph $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2023.

(2) Department of Agriculture capacity and infrastructure

(A) In general

The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, increase the capacity and infrastructure of the Department

(i) to address colony collapse disorder and other long-term threats to pollinator health, including the hiring of additional personnel; and

(ii) to conduct research on colony collapse disorder and other pollinator issues at the facilities of the Department.

(B) Authorization of appropriations

There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this paragraph $7,250,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2023.

(3) Honey bee surveillance

There is authorized to be appropriated to conduct a nationwide honey bee pest, pathogen, health, and population status surveillance program $2,750,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2023.

(4) Enhanced coordination of honeybee and pollinator research

(A) In general

The Chief Scientist of the Department of Agriculture shall coordinate research, extension, education, and economic activities in the Department of Agriculture relating to native and managed pollinator health and habitat.

(B) Duties

In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Chief Scientist shall

(i) assign an individual to serve in the Office of the Chief Scientist as a Honeybee and Pollinator Research Coordinator who shall be responsible for leading the efforts of the Chief Scientist in carrying out such subparagraph;

(ii) implement and coordinate pollinator health research efforts of the Department, as recommended by the Pollinator Health Task Force;

(iii) establish annual strategic priorities and goals for the Department for native and managed pollinator research;

(iv) communicate such priorities and goals to each agency or office of the Department of Agriculture, the managed pollinator industry, and relevant grant recipients under programs administered by the Secretary; and

(v) coordinate and identify all research on native and managed pollinator health needed and conducted by the Department of Agriculture and relevant grant recipients under programs administered by the Secretary to ensure consistency and reduce unintended duplication of effort.

(C) Research

In coordinating research activities under subparagraph (A), the Chief Scientist shall ensure that such research

(i) identifies and addresses the multiple stressors on pollinator health, including pests and pathogens, reduced habitat, lack of nutritional resources, and exposure to pesticides;

(ii) evaluates stewardship and management practices of managed pollinators that would impact managed pollinator health;

(iii) documents the prevalence of major pests, such as varroa destructor (commonly referred to as the varroa mite), and diseases that are transported between States through practices involving managed pollinators;

(iv) evaluates the impact of overcrowding of colonies for pollination services and the impact of such overcrowding on pollinator health status and pollinator health recovery;

(v) evaluates and reports on the health differences of managed pollinators in

(I) crops not requiring contract pollination;

(II) crops requiring contract pollination; and

(III) native habitat;

(vi) evaluates the impact of horticultural and agricultural pest management practices on native and managed pollinator colonies in diverse agroecosystems;

(vii) documents pesticide residues that are

(I) found in native and managed pollinator colonies; and

(II) associated with typical localized commercial crop pest management practices;

(viii) with respect to native and managed pollinator colonies visiting crops for crop pollination or honey production purposes, documents

(I) the strength and health of such colonies;

(II) the survival, growth, reproduction, and production of such colonies;

(III) pests, pathogens, and viruses that affect such colonies;

(IV) environmental conditions of such colonies;

(V) beekeeper practices; and

(VI) any other relevant information, as determined by the Chief Scientist;

(ix) documents, with respect to healthy populations of managed pollinators, best management practices and other practices for managed pollinators and crop managers;

(x) evaluates the effectiveness of

(I) conservation practices that target the specific needs of native and managed pollinator habitats;

(II) incentives that allow for the expansion of native and managed pollinator forage acreage; and

(III) managed pollinator breeding practices and efforts to, with respect to managed pollinators, avoid creating a genetic bottleneck and improve genetic diversity;

(xi) in the case of commercially managed pollinator colonies, continues to gather data

(I) on an annual basis with respect to losses of such colonies, splits of such colonies, and the total number of pollinator colonies;

(II) on rising input costs; and

(III) overall economic value to the food economy; and

(xii) addresses any other issue relating to native and managed pollinators, as determined by the Chief Scientist, in consultation with scientific experts.

(D) Publication

The Chief Scientist, to the maximum extent practicable, shall

(i) make publicly available the results of the research described in subparagraph (C); and

(ii) in the case of the research described in subparagraph (C)(vi), publish any data or reports that were produced by the Department of Agriculture but not made publicly available during the period beginning on January 1, 2008 , and ending on December 20, 2018 .

(5) Consultation

The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall publish guidance on enhancing pollinator health and the long-term viability of populations of pollinators, including recommendations related to

(A) allowing for managed honey bees to forage on National Forest System lands where compatible with other natural resource management priorities; and

(B) planting and maintaining managed honey bee and native pollinator foraging on National Forest System lands where compatible with other natural resource management priorities.

(6) Annual report on response to honey bee colony collapse disorder

The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate an annual report

(A) describing the progress made by the Department of Agriculture in

(i) investigating the cause or causes of honey bee colony collapse and honey bee health disorders;

(ii) finding appropriate strategies, including best management practices  1 to reduce colony loss; and

(iii) addressing the decline of managed honey bees and native pollinators;

(B) assessing Federal efforts to mitigate pollinator losses and threats to the United States commercial beekeeping industry; and

(C) providing recommendations to Congress regarding how to better coordinate Federal agency efforts to address the decline of managed honey bees and native pollinators.
