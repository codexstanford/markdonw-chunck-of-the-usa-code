### CHAPTER 36— CROP INSURANCE
#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (g) Yield determinations

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), the Corporation shall establish crop insurance underwriting rules that ensure that yield coverage, as specified in this subsection, is provided to eligible producers obtaining catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) or additional coverage under subsection (c).

(2) Yield coverage plans

(A) Actual production history

Subject to subparagraph (B) and paragraph (4)(C), the yield for a crop shall be based on the actual production history for the crop, if the crop was produced on the farm without penalty during each of the 4 crop years immediately preceding the crop year for which actual production history is being established, building up to a production data base for each of the 10 consecutive crop years preceding the crop year for which actual production history is being established.

(B) Assigned yield

If the producer does not provide satisfactory evidence of the yield of a commodity under subparagraph (A), the producer shall be assigned

(i) a yield that is not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Corporation for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Corporation based on production history requirements;

(ii) a yield determined by the Corporation, in the case of

(I) a producer that has not had a share of the production of the insured crop for more than two crop years, as determined by the Secretary;

(II) a producer that produces an agricultural commodity on land that has not been farmed by the producer; or

(III) a producer that rotates a crop produced on a farm to a crop that has not been produced on the farm; or

(iii) if the producer is a beginning farmer or rancher or veteran farmer or rancher who was previously involved in a farming or ranching operation, including involvement in the decisionmaking or physical involvement in the production of the crop or livestock on the farm, for any acreage obtained by the beginning farmer or rancher or veteran farmer or rancher, a yield that is the higher of

(I) the actual production history of the previous producer of the crop or livestock on the acreage determined under subparagraph (A); or

(II) a yield of the producer, as determined in clause (i).

(C) Area yield

The Corporation may offer a crop insurance plan based on an area yield that allows an insured producer to qualify for an indemnity if a loss has occurred in an area (as specified by the Corporation) in which the farm of the producer is located. Under an area yield plan, an insured producer shall be allowed to select the level of area production at which an indemnity will be paid consistent with such terms and conditions as are established by the Corporation.

(D) Commodity-by-commodity basis

A producer may choose between individual yield or area yield coverage or combined coverage, if available, on a commodity-by-commodity basis.

(E) Sources of yield data

To determine yields under this paragraph, the Corporation

(i) shall use county data collected by the Risk Management Agency, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, or both; or

(ii) if sufficient county data is not available, may use other data considered appropriate by the Secretary.

(3) Transitional yields for producers of feed or forage

(A) In general

If a producer does not provide satisfactory evidence of a yield under paragraph (2)(A), the producer shall be assigned a yield that is at least 80 percent of the transitional yield established by the Corporation (adjusted to reflect the actual production history of the producer) if the Secretary determines that

(i) the producer grows feed or forage primarily for on-farm use in a livestock, dairy, or poultry operation; and

(ii) over 50 percent of the net farm income of the producer is derived from the operation.

(B) Yield calculation

The Corporation shall

(i) for the first year of participation of a producer, provide the assigned yield under this paragraph to the producer of feed or forage; and

(ii) for the second year of participation of the producer, apply the actual production history or assigned yield requirement, as provided in this subsection.

(C) Termination of authority

The authority provided by this paragraph shall terminate on the date that is 3 years after the effective date of this paragraph.

(4) Adjustment in actual production history to establish insurable yields

(A) Application

This paragraph shall apply whenever the Corporation uses the actual production records of the producer to establish the producer’s actual production history for an agricultural commodity for any of the 2001 and subsequent crop years.

(B) Election to use percentage of transitional yield

If, for one or more of the crop years used to establish the producer’s actual production history of an agricultural commodity, the producer’s recorded or appraised yield of the commodity was less than 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield, as determined by the Corporation, the Corporation shall, at the election of the producer

(i) exclude any of such recorded or appraised yield; and

(ii)

(I) replace each excluded yield with a yield equal to 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield; or

(II) in the case of beginning farmers or ranchers and veteran farmers or ranchers, replace each excluded yield with a yield equal to 80 percent of the applicable transitional yield.

(C) Election to exclude certain history

(i) In general

Notwithstanding paragraph (2), with respect to 1 or more of the crop years used to establish the actual production history of an agricultural commodity of the producer, the producer may elect to exclude any recorded or appraised yield for any crop year in which the per planted acre yield of the agricultural commodity in the county of the producer was at least 50 percent below the simple average of the per planted acre yield of the agricultural commodity in the county during the previous 10 consecutive crop years.

(ii) Contiguous counties

In any crop year that a producer in a county is eligible to make an election to exclude a yield under clause (i), a producer in a contiguous county is eligible to make such an election.

(iii) Irrigation practice

For purposes of determining whether the per planted acre yield of the agricultural commodity in the county of the producer was at least 50 percent below the simple average of the per planted acre yield of the agricultural commodity in the county during the previous 10 consecutive crop years, the Corporation shall make a separate determination for irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.

(D) Premium adjustment

In the case of a producer that makes an election under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Corporation shall adjust the premium to reflect the risk associated with the adjustment made in the actual production history of the producer.

(5) Adjustment to reflect increased yields from successful pest control efforts

(A) Situations justifying adjustment

The Corporation shall develop a methodology for adjusting the actual production history of a producer when each of the following apply:

(i) The producer’s farm is located in an area where systematic, area-wide efforts have been undertaken using certain operations or measures, or the producer’s farm is a location at which certain operations or measures have been undertaken, to detect, eradicate, suppress, or control, or at least to prevent or retard the spread of, a plant disease or plant pest, including a plant pest (as defined in section 7759  2 of this title).

(ii) The presence of the plant disease or plant pest has been found to adversely affect the yield of the agricultural commodity for which the producer is applying for insurance.

(iii) The efforts described in clause (i) have been effective.

(B) Adjustment amount

The amount by which the Corporation adjusts the actual production history of a producer of an agricultural commodity shall reflect the degree to which the success of the systematic, area-wide efforts described in subparagraph (A), on average, increases the yield of the commodity on the producer’s farm, as determined by the Corporation.

(6) Continued authority

(A) In general

The Corporation shall establish

(i) underwriting rules that limit the decrease in the actual production history of a producer, at the election of the producer, to not more than 10 percent of the actual production history of the previous crop year provided that the production decline was the result of drought, flood, natural disaster, or other insurable loss (as determined by the Corporation); and

(ii) actuarially sound premiums to cover additional risk.

(B) Other authority

The authority provided under subparagraph (A) is in addition to any other authority that adjusts the actual production history of the producer under this subchapter.

(C) Effect

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a change in the administration of any provision of this subchapter as the subchapter was administered for the 2018 reinsurance year.
