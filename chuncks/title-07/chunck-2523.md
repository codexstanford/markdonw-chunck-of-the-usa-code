### CHAPTER 45— SOIL BANK PROGRAM
#### § 1838. Conversion of cropland into vegetative cover, water storage, wildlife and conservation uses; contracts with farmers
##### (d) Advertising and bid procedures

The Secretary shall, unless he determines that such action will be inconsistent with the effective administration of the program, use an advertising and bid procedure in determining the lands in any area to be covered by agreements. The total acreage placed under contract in any county or local community shall be limited to a percentage of the total eligible acreage in such county or local community which the Secretary determines would not adversely affect the economy of the county or local community. In determining such percentage the Secretary shall give appropriate consideration to the productivity of the acreage being retired as compared to the average productivity of eligible acreage in the county or local community.
