#### § 3196. Research on national and regional animal health or disease problems
##### (c) Establishment of annual priority lists for allocation of funds

In order to establish a rational allocation of funds appropriated under this section, the Secretary shall establish annually priority lists of animal health and disease, food safety, and animal well-being problems of national or regional significance. Such lists shall be prepared after consultation with the Advisory Board. Any recommendations made in connection with such consultation shall not be controlling on the Secretary’s determination of priorities. In establishing such priorities, the Secretary and the Advisory Board shall consider the following factors:

(1) any health or disease problem which causes or may cause significant economic losses to any part of the livestock production industry;

(2) any food safety problem that has a significant pre-harvest (on-farm) component and is recognized as posing a significant health hazard to the consuming public;

(3) issues of animal well-being related to production methods that will improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species;

(4) whether current scientific knowledge necessary to prevent, cure, or abate such a health or disease problem is adequate; and

(5) whether the status of scientific research is such that accomplishments may be anticipated through the application of scientific effort to such health or disease problem.
