(B) Reporting deadline and plants required to report

A packer required to report under subparagraph (A) shall

(i) not later than 7:00 a.m. Central Time on each reporting day, report information regarding all barrows and gilts purchased or priced, and

The information from the prior business day of a packer required under this paragraph shall include

(i) all purchase data, including

(I) the total number of

(aa) barrows and gilts purchased; and

(bb) barrows and gilts scheduled for delivery; and

(II) the base price and purchase data for slaughtered barrows and gilts for which a price has been established;

(ii) all slaughter data for the total number of barrows and gilts slaughtered, including

(I) information concerning the net price, which shall be equal to the total amount paid by a packer to a producer (including all premiums, less all discounts) per hundred pounds of carcass weight of barrows and gilts delivered at the plant

(aa) including any sum deducted from the price per hundredweight paid to a producer that reflects the repayment of a balance owed by the producer to the packer or the accumulation of a balance to later be repaid by the packer to the producer; and

(bb) excluding any sum earlier paid to a producer that must later be repaid to the packer;

(II) information concerning the average net price, which shall be equal to the quotient (stated per hundred pounds of carcass weight of barrows and gilts) obtained by dividing

(aa) the total amount paid for the barrows and gilts slaughtered at a packing plant during the applicable reporting period, including all premiums and discounts, and including any sum deducted from the price per hundredweight paid to a producer that reflects the repayment of a balance owed by the producer to the packer, or the accumulation of a balance to later be repaid by the packer to the producer, less all discounts; by

(bb) the total carcass weight (in hundred pound increments) of the barrows and gilts;

(III) information concerning the lowest net price, which shall be equal to the lowest net price paid for a single lot or a group of barrows or gilts slaughtered at a packing plant during the applicable reporting period per hundred pounds of carcass weight of barrows and gilts;

(V) the average carcass weight, which shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing

(aa) the total carcass weight of the barrows and gilts slaughtered at the packing plant during the applicable reporting period, by

(bb) the number of the barrows and gilts described in item (aa),   adjusted for special slaughter situations (such as skinning or foot removal), as the Secretary determines necessary to render comparable carcass weights;

(VI) the average sort loss, which shall be equal to the average discount (in dollars per hundred pounds carcass weight) for barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period, resulting from the fact that the barrows and gilts did not fall within the individual packer’s established carcass weight or lot variation range;

(VII) the average backfat, which shall be equal to the average of the backfat thickness (in inches) measured between the third and fourth from the last ribs, 7 centimeters from the carcass split (or adjusted from the individual packer’s measurement to that reference point using an adjustment made by the Secretary) of the barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period;

(VIII) the average lean percentage, which shall be equal to the average percentage of the carcass weight comprised of lean meat for the barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period, except that when a packer is required to report the average lean percentage under this subclause, the packer shall make available to the Secretary the underlying data, applicable methodology and formulae, and supporting materials used to determine the average lean percentage, which the Secretary may convert to the carcass measurements or lean percentage of the barrows and gilts of the individual packer to correlate to a common percent lean measurement; and

(IX) the total slaughter quantity, which shall be equal to the total number of barrows and gilts slaughtered during the applicable reporting period, including all types of purchases and barrows and gilts that qualify as packer-owned swine; and

(iii) packer purchase commitments, which shall be equal to the number of barrows and gilts scheduled for delivery to a packer for slaughter for each of the next 14 calendar days.
