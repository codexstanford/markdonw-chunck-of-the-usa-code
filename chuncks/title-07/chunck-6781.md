##### (c) Memorandum of understanding

(1) In general

Promptly after June 12, 2002 , the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding overlap agents and toxins that is in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (4) and contains such additional provisions as the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services determine to be appropriate.

(2) Single registration system regarding registered persons

The memorandum of understanding under paragraph (1) shall provide for the development and implementation of a single system of registration for persons who possess, use, or transfer overlap agents or toxins and are required to register under both the section 351A program and the section 212 program. For purposes of such system, the memorandum shall provide for the development and implementation of the following:

(A) A single registration form through which the person submitting the form provides all information that is required for registration under the section 351A program and all information that is required for registration under the section 212 program.

(B) A procedure through which a person may choose to submit the single registration form to the agency administering the section 351A program (in the manner provided under such program), or to the agency administering the section 212 program (in the manner provided under such program).

(C) A procedure through which a copy of a single registration form received pursuant to subparagraph (B) by the agency administering one of such programs is promptly provided to the agency administering the other program.

(D) A procedure through which the agency receiving the single registration form under one of such programs obtains the concurrence of the agency administering the other program that the requirements for registration under the other program have been met.

(E) A procedure through which

(i) the agency receiving the single registration form under one of such programs informs the agency administering the other program whether the receiving agency has denied the registration; and

(ii) each of such agencies ensures that registrations are entered into the national database of registered persons that is maintained by each such agency.

(3) Process of identification

With respect to the process of identification under the section 351A program and the section 212 program for names and other identifying information submitted to the Attorney General (relating to certain categories of individuals and entities), the memorandum of understanding under paragraph (1) shall provide for the development and implementation of the following:

(A) A procedure through which a person who is required to submit information pursuant to such process makes (in addition to the submission to the Attorney General) a submission, at the option of the person, to either the agency administering the section 351A program or the agency administering the section 212 program, but not both, which submission satisfies the requirement of submission for both of such programs.

(B) A procedure for the sharing by both of such agencies of information received from the Attorney General by one of such agencies pursuant to the submission under subparagraph (A).

(C) A procedure through which the agencies administering such programs concur in determinations that access to overlap agents and toxins will be granted.

(4) Coordination of inspections and enforcement

The memorandum of understanding under paragraph (1) shall provide for the development and implementation of procedures under which Federal personnel under the section 351A program and the section 212 program may share responsibilities for inspections and enforcement activities under such programs regarding overlap agents and toxins. Activities carried out under such procedures by one of such programs on behalf of the other may be carried out with or without reimbursement by the agency that administers the other program.

(5) Date certain for implementation

The memorandum of understanding under paragraph (1) shall be implemented not later than 180 days after June 12, 2002 . Until the single system of registration under paragraph (2) is implemented, persons who possess, use, or transfer overlap agents or toxins shall register under both the section 351A program and the section 212 program.
