### CHAPTER 103— AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION REFORM
#### § 7628. Support for research regarding diseases of wheat, triticale, and barley caused by Fusarium graminearum or by Tilletia indica
##### (b) Research components

Funds provided under this section shall be available for the following collaborative, multi-State research activities:

(1) Identification and understanding of the epidemiology of wheat scab or of Karnal bunt, and the toxicological properties of vomitoxin, a toxic metabolite commonly occurring in wheat, triticale, and barley infected with wheat scab.

(2) Development of crop management strategies to reduce the risk of wheat scab or Karnal bunt occurrence.

(3) Development of

(A) efficient and accurate methods to monitor wheat, triticale, and barley for the presence of Karnal bunt or of wheat scab and resulting vomitoxin contamination;

(B) post-harvest management techniques for wheat, triticale, and barley infected with wheat scab or with Karnal bunt; and

(C) milling and food processing techniques to render wheat scab contaminated grain safe.

(4) Strengthening and expansion of plant-breeding activities to enhance the resistance of wheat, triticale, and barley to wheat scab and to Karnal bunt, including the establishment of a regional advanced breeding material evaluation nursery and a germplasm introduction and evaluation system.

(5) Development and deployment of alternative fungicide application systems and formulations to control wheat scab and Karnal bunt and consideration of other chemical control strategies to assist farmers until new more resistant wheat, triticale, and barley varieties are available.
