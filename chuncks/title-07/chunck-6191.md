#### § 7632. Specialty crop research initiative
##### (b) Establishment

There is established within the Department a specialty crop research and extension initiative to address the critical needs of the specialty crop industry by developing and disseminating science-based tools to address needs of specific crops and their regions, including

(1) research in plant breeding, genetics, genomics, and other methods to improve crop characteristics, such as

(A) product, taste, quality, and appearance;

(B) size-controlling rootstock systems for perennial crops;

(C) environmental responses and tolerances;

(D) nutrient management, including plant nutrient uptake efficiency;

(E) pest and disease management, including resistance to pests and diseases resulting in reduced application management strategies; and

(F) enhanced phytonutrient content;

(2) efforts to identify and address threats from pests and diseases, including

(A) threats to specialty crop pollinators;

(B) emerging and invasive species; and

(C) a more effective understanding and utilization of existing natural enemy complexes;

(3) efforts

(A) to improve production efficiency, handling and processing, productivity, and profitability over the long term (including specialty crop policy and marketing); and

(B) to achieve a better understanding of

(i) the soil rhizosphere microbiome;

(ii) pesticide application systems and certified drift-reduction technologies; and

(iii) systems to improve and extend the storage life of specialty crops;

(4) new innovations and technology, including

(A) mechanization and automation of labor-intensive tasks in production and processing;

(B) technologies that delay or inhibit ripening;

(C) decision support systems driven by phenology and environmental factors;

(D) improved monitoring systems for agricultural pests; and

(E) effective systems for preharvest and postharvest management of quarantine pests; and

(5) methods to prevent, detect, monitor, control, and respond to potential food safety hazards in the production and processing of specialty crops, including fresh produce.
