Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section

(1) any person domiciled in the United States who on May 1, 1978 , was in the business of granting an option on a physical commodity, other than a commodity specifically set forth in section 2(a) of this title prior to October 23, 1974 , and was in the business of buying, selling, producing, or otherwise using that commodity, may continue to grant or issue options on that commodity in accordance with Commission regulations in effect on August 17, 1978 , until thirty days after the effective date of regulations issued by the Commission under clause (2) of this subsection: Provided , That if such person files an application for registration under the regulations issued under clause (2) of this subsection within thirty days after the effective date of such regulations, that person may continue to grant or issue options pending a final determination by the Commission on the application; and

(2) the Commission shall issue regulations that permit grantors and futures commission merchants to offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of, any commodity option transaction on a physical commodity subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, other than a commodity specifically set forth in section 2(a) of this title prior to October 23, 1974 , if

(A) the grantor is a person domiciled in the United States who

(i) is in the business of buying, selling, producing, or otherwise using the underlying commodity;

(ii) at all times has a net worth of at least $5,000,000 certified annually by an independent public accountant using generally accepted accounting principles;

(iii) notifies the Commission and every futures commission merchant offering the grantor’s option if the grantor knows or has reason to believe that the grantor’s net worth has fallen below $5,000,000;

(iv) segregates daily, exclusively for the benefit of purchasers, money, exempted securities (within the meaning of section 78c(a)(12) of title 15 ), commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, commercial bills, or unencumbered warehouse receipts, equal to an amount by which the value of each transaction exceeds the amount received or to be received by the grantor for such transaction;

(v) provides an identification number for each transaction; and

(vi) provides confirmation of all orders for such transactions executed, including the execution price and a transaction identification number;

(B) the futures commission merchant is a person who

(i) has evidence that the grantor meets the requirements specified in subclause (A) of this clause;

(ii) treats and deals with all money, securities, or property received from its customers as payment of the purchase price in connection with such transactions, as belonging to such customers until the expiration of the term of the option, or, if the customer exercises the option, until all rights of the customer under the commodity option transaction have been fulfilled;

(iii) records each transaction in its customer’s name by the transaction identification number provided by the grantor;

The Commission may terminate the right of any person to grant, offer, or sell options under this subsection only after a hearing, including a finding that the continuation of such right is contrary to the public interest: Provided , That pending the completion of such termination proceedings, the Commission may suspend the right to grant, offer, or sell options of any person whose activities in the Commission’s judgment present a substantial risk to the public interest.
