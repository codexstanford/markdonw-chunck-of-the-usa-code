#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (d) Premiums

(1) Premiums required

The Corporation shall fix adequate premiums for all the plans of insurance of the Corporation at such rates as the Board determines are actuarially sufficient to attain an expected loss ratio of not greater than

(A) 1.1 through September 30, 1998 ;

(B) 1.075 for the period beginning October 1, 1998 , and ending on the day before the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; and

(C) 1.0 on and after the date of enactment of that Act.

(2) Premium amounts

The premium amounts for catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) and additional coverage under subsection (c) shall be fixed as follows:

(A) In the case of catastrophic risk protection, the amount of the premium established by the Corporation for each crop for which catastrophic risk protection is available shall be reduced by the percentage equal to the difference between the average loss ratio for the crop and 100 percent, plus a reasonable reserve, as determined by the Corporation.

(B) In the case of additional coverage equal to or greater than 50 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at not greater than 100 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage for a policy or plan of insurance that is not based on individual yield, the amount of the premium shall

(i) be sufficient to cover anticipated losses and a reasonable reserve; and

(ii) include an amount for operating and administrative expenses, as determined by the Corporation, on an industry-wide basis as a percentage of the amount of the premium used to define loss ratio.

(3) Performance-based discount

The Corporation may provide a performance-based premium discount for a producer of an agricultural commodity who has good insurance or production experience relative to other producers of that agricultural commodity in the same area, as determined by the Corporation.

(4) Billing date for premiums

Effective beginning with the 2012 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall establish August 15 as the billing date for premiums.
