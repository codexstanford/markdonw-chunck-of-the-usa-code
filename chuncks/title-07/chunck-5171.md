(C) Submission of refund demands

(i) In general

In each State in which a qualified State soybean board collects assessments, as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(i), producers shall submit demands for refunds of assessments to the qualified State soybean board.

In each State in which there is no qualified State soybean board, producers shall submit demands for refunds of assessments directly to the Board.

(D) Time limit for making refund

Subject to subparagraph (C)(i), each refund to a producer of an assessment under this paragraph shall be made as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 60 days, after submission of proof satisfactory to the qualified State soybean board or the Board that the producer paid the assessment for which refund is demanded.

(E) Order not favored

If the Secretary determines that producers do not favor the continuation of the order in the referendum provided for in section 6305(a) of this title , refunds shall be made under this paragraph on collected assessments until such collections are terminated, as provided in section 6305(a) of this title .

(i) In general

The order shall contain provisions relating to refunds after the approval of the order in the initial referendum under section 6305(a) of this title as required in this subparagraph.

Such refunds shall be made available, under the procedures specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) to the extent not inconsistent with this subparagraph, to producers who have requested refunds during such period.

(iii) Poll

Not later than the end of the period provided for in clause (ii), the Secretary shall conduct a poll of soybean producers, using the procedures provided for in section 6305(b)(3) of this title , to determine if producers support the conduct of a referendum on the continuance of the payment of refunds under the order.

(iv) Referendum

If the Secretary determines, based on the poll conducted under clause (iii), that the conduct of a referendum is supported by at least 20 percent of the producers (not in excess of one-fifth of which may be producers in any one State) who, during a representative period, have been engaged in the production of soybeans, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum among all such producers for the purpose of determining whether such producers favor the continuation of the payment of refunds under the order. Such referendum shall be conducted, under the procedures provided for in section 6305 of this title , not later than 1 year after the Secretary determines, based on the poll, that the referendum is required.

(v) Continued refunds

If the Secretary conducts a referendum under clause (iv), the qualified State soybean board and, where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board shall continue to make refunds available to producers as provided for in clause (ii) during the period prior to the conduct of the referendum, which shall be payable at the end of the period from the escrowed funds, as provided in clause (vii).

If the Secretary determines, in the referendum conducted under clause (iv), that continuation of the payment of refunds is favored by a majority of the producers voting in such referendum, the qualified State soybean board and, where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board shall continue to make refunds available to producers as provided for in clause (ii) for each 1-year period that follows until such time as soybean producers approve an amendment to the order to eliminate such refunds. Such refunds shall be payable at the end of each such 1-year period from escrowed funds, as provided in clause (vii). If the Secretary determines in the referendum that continuation of such refunds is not favored by a majority of producers voting in the referendum, the right to such refunds shall cease immediately.

(vii) Escrow accounts

(I) Establishment

The qualified State soybean board and, for producers in States where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board shall establish escrow accounts to be used to pay refunds under clause (ii) and, if necessary, clauses (v) and (vi).

(II) Separate accounts

The qualified State soybean board and, where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board shall establish separate escrow accounts for each State from which producer assessments are collected for the purpose of making refunds under clauses (ii), (v), and (vi), respectively.

(III) Deposits

The qualified State soybean board and, where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board shall deposit into its escrow account for refunds under clause (ii), (v), or (vi), as appropriate, 10 percent of the total assessment collected by the qualified State soybean board and, where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board (including the assessment provided under paragraph (2) and contributions by producers to qualified State soybean boards under paragraph (4)), during the time period involved.

(IV) Refunds made from escrow account

Refunds requested by producers from a State under clause (ii) (or if refunds are available under clause (v) or (vi)) during the time period involved shall be made from the escrow account that is applicable to that clause for such State.

(V) Proration

If the funds deposited in a State account established under subclause (I) for purposes described under clauses (ii), (v), and (vi) are not sufficient to honor all requests for refunds made by producers from that State during the time period involved, the qualified State soybean board and, where no qualified State soybean board exists, the Board shall prorate the amount of such refunds from the State’s account among all producers from that State that request refunds.

(VI) Surplus funds

Any funds not refunded to producers in a State under this clause shall be divided equally between the Board and the qualified State soybean board of such State. Such funds shall be used to carry out programs under this chapter.

(VII) Refund period

In applying this clause to refunds under clause (vi), each annual refund period shall be treated separately.

(3) Use

The assessments (net of any refunds under paragraph (2)) shall be used for

(A) payment of the expenses incurred in implementation and administration of the order;

(B) the establishment of a reasonable reserve; and

(C) reimbursement to the Secretary of administrative costs incurred by the Secretary to implement and administer the order, other than one-half of the cost incurred for the referendum conducted under paragraph (2)(F).

(4) Credit for contributions to qualified State soybean boards

A producer who can establish that such producer is contributing to a qualified State soybean board shall receive credit, in determining the assessment due to the Board from such producer, for contributions to the qualified State soybean board of up to one-quarter of 1 percent of the net market price of soybeans or the equivalent thereof. For purposes of this chapter, there shall be only one qualified State soybean board in each State. A producer may receive a credit under this paragraph only if the contribution is to the qualified State soybean board in the State in which the soybeans are produced, except that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may authorize exceptions to such State-of-origin rule as are appropriate to ensure effective coordination of collection procedures among States.

(5) Single process of assessment

The procedures in the order for the collection of assessments shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that such soybeans are subject to a single process of assessment under the order.
