##### (a) Definitions

In this section:

(1) Community wood energy system

(A) In general

The term “community wood energy system” means an energy system that

(i) produces thermal energy or combined thermal energy and electricity where thermal is the primary energy output;

(ii) services public facilities owned or operated by State or local governments (including schools, town halls, libraries, and other public buildings) or private or nonprofit facilities (including commercial and business facilities, such as hospitals, office buildings, apartment buildings, and manufacturing and industrial buildings); and

(iii) uses woody biomass, including residuals

(I) that have not been adulterated with glue or other chemical treatments from wood processing facilities, as the primary fuel; and

(II) for which the use of that biomass for energy production does not cause conversion of forests to nonforest use.

(B) Inclusions

The term “community wood energy system” includes single-facility central heating, district heating systems serving multiple buildings, combined heat and electric systems where thermal energy is the primary energy output, and other related biomass energy systems.

(2) Innovative wood product facility

The term “innovative wood product facility” means a manufacturing or processing plant or mill that produces

(A) building components or systems that use large panelized wood construction, including mass timber;

(B) wood products derived from nanotechnology or other new technology processes, as determined by the Secretary; or

(C) other innovative wood products that use low-value, low-quality wood, as determined by the Secretary.

(3) Mass timber

The term “mass timber” includes

(A) cross-laminated timber;

(B) nail-laminated timber;

(C) glue-laminated timber;

(D) laminated strand lumber; and

(E) laminated veneer lumber.

(4) Program

The term “Program” means the Community Wood Energy and Wood Innovation Program established under subsection (b).
