(1) In general

(A) Coverages

In the case of an eligible crop described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Agriculture shall operate a noninsured crop disaster assistance program to provide coverages based on individual yields (other than for value-loss crops) equivalent to

(i) catastrophic risk protection available under section 508(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1508(b) ); or

(ii) except in the case of crops and grasses used for grazing, additional coverage available under subsections (c) and (h) of section 508 of that Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1508 ) that does not exceed 65 percent, as described in subsection ( l ).

(B) Administration

The Secretary shall carry out this section through the Farm Service Agency (referred to in this section as the “Agency”).

(C) Data collection and sharing

The Secretary shall coordinate with the Administrator of the Risk Management Agency on the type and format of data received under the noninsured crop disaster assistance program that

(i) best facilitates the use of that data in developing policies or plans of insurance offered under the Federal Crop Insurance Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.); and

(ii) ensures the availability of that data on a regular basis.

(D) Coordination

The Secretary shall coordinate between the agencies of the Department that provide programs or services to farmers and ranchers that are potentially eligible for the noninsured crop disaster assistance program under this section

(i) to make available coverage under

(I) the fee waiver under subsection (k)(2); or

(II) the premium discount under subsection ( l )(3); and

(ii) to share eligibility information to reduce paperwork and avoid duplication.

(2) Eligible crops

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), in this section, the term “eligible crop” means each commercial crop or other agricultural commodity that is produced for food or fiber (except livestock) for which catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1508 ) and additional coverage under subsections (c) and (h) of such section are not available or, if such coverage is available, it is only available under a policy that provides coverage for specific intervals based on weather indexes or under a whole farm plan of insurance.

(B) Crops specifically included

The term “eligible crop” shall include floricultural, ornamental nursery, and Christmas tree crops, turfgrass sod, seed crops, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), sea grass and sea oats, camelina, sweet sorghum, biomass sorghum, and industrial crops (including those grown expressly for the purpose of producing a feedstock for renewable biofuel, renewable electricity, or biobased products).

(C) Combination of similar types or varieties

At the option of the Secretary, all types or varieties of a crop or commodity, described in subparagraphs (A) and (B), may be considered to be a single eligible crop under this section.

(3) Cause of loss

To qualify for assistance under this section, the losses of the noninsured commodity shall be due to drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary.

(4) Program reduction in benefits relating to crop production on native sod

(i) on which the plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing; and

(aa) during the first 10 crop years after the initial tillage; and

(bb) during which a crop on that acreage is enrolled under subsection ( l )(2) or (k).

(ii) De minimis acreage exemption

The Secretary shall exempt areas of 5 acres or less from clause (i).
