#### § 5821. Integrated management systems
##### (a) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish a research and education program concerning integrated resource management and integrated crop management in order to enhance research related to farming operations, practices, and systems that optimize crop and livestock production potential and are environmentally sound. The purpose of the program shall be

(1) to encourage producers to adopt integrated crop and livestock management practices and systems that minimize or abate adverse environmental impacts, reduce soil erosion and loss of water and nutrients, enhance the efficient use of on-farm and off-farm inputs, and maintain or increase profitability and long-term productivity;

(2) to develop knowledge and information on integrated crop and livestock management systems and practices to assist agricultural producers in the adoption of these systems and practices;

(3) to accumulate and analyze information on agricultural production practices researched or developed under programs established under this subchapter, chapter 86 of this title, 1 and other appropriate programs of the Department of Agriculture to further the development of integrated crop and livestock management systems;

(4) to facilitate the adoption of whole-farm integrated crop and livestock management systems through demonstration projects on individual farms, including small and limited resource farms, throughout the United States; and

(5) to evaluate and recommend appropriate integrated crop and livestock management policies and programs.
