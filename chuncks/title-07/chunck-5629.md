### CHAPTER 98— DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REORGANIZATION
#### § 7011. Successorship provisions relating to bargaining units and exclusive representatives
##### (b) Effect of an agreement

(1) In general

If the affected parties reach agreement on the appropriate unit and the exclusive representative for such unit under subsection (a), the Federal Labor Relations Authority shall certify the terms of such agreement, subject to paragraph (2)(A). Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to require the holding of any hearing or election as a condition for certification.

(2) Restrictions

(A) Conditions requiring noncertification

The Federal Labor Relations Authority may not certify the terms of an agreement under paragraph (1) if

(i) it determines that any of the criteria referred to in subsection (a)(2) (disregarding section 7112(a) of title 5 ) have not been met; or

(ii) after the Secretary’s exercise of authority and before certification under this section, a valid election under section 7111(b) of title 5 is held covering any employees who would be included in the unit proposed for certification.

(B) Temporary waiver of provision that would bar an election after a collective bargaining agreement is reached

Nothing in section 7111(f)(3) of title 5 shall prevent the holding of an election under section 7111(b) of such title that covers employees within a unit certified under paragraph (1), or giving effect to the results of such an election (including a decision not to be represented by any labor organization), if the election is held before the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date such unit is so certified.

(C) Clarification

The certification of a unit under paragraph (1) shall not, for purposes of the last sentence of section 7111(b) of title 5 or section 7111(f)(4) of such title, be treated as if it had occurred pursuant to an election.

(3) Delegation

(A) In general

The Federal Labor Relations Authority may delegate to any regional director (as referred to in section 7105(e) of title 5 ) its authority under the preceding provisions of this subsection.

(B) Review

Any action taken by a regional director under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to review under the provisions of section 7105(f) of title 5 in the same manner as if such action had been taken under section 7105(e) of such title, except that in the case of a decision not to certify, such review shall be required if application therefor is filed by an affected party within the time specified in such provisions.
