##### (e) Premium obligations

(1) Pro-ration of premium for new participants

In the case of a participating dairy operation that first registers to participate in dairy margin coverage for a calendar year after the start of the calendar year, the participating dairy operation shall pay a pro-rated premium for that calendar year based on the portion of the calendar year for which the participating dairy operation purchases the coverage.

(2) Legal obligation

A participating dairy operation in dairy margin coverage for a calendar year shall be legally obligated to pay the applicable premium for that calendar year, except that the Secretary may waive that obligation, under terms and conditions determined by the Secretary, for any participating dairy operation in the case of death, retirement, permanent dissolution of a participating dairy operation, or other circumstances as the Secretary considers appropriate to ensure the integrity of dairy margin coverage.
