### CHAPTER 36— CROP INSURANCE
#### § 1508a. Double insurance and prevented planting
##### (c) Prevented planting coverage

(1) Options on loss to first crop

Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e), if a first crop insured under this subchapter in a crop year is prevented from being planted, the producer of the first crop may elect one of the following options:

(A) No second crop planted

The producer may

(i) elect to not plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

(ii) subject to paragraph (4), collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the prevented planting guarantee for the acreage for the first crop.

(B) Second crop planted

The producer may

(i) plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

(ii) subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), collect an indemnity payment established by the Corporation for the first crop, but not to exceed 35 percent of the prevented planting guarantee for the acreage for the first crop.

(2) Premium for first crop if second planted

If the producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B), the producer shall pay a premium for the first crop that is commensurate with the indemnity paid under paragraph (1)(B)(ii). The Corporation shall adjust the total premium for the first crop to reflect the reduced indemnity.

(3) Effect on actual production history

Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d), if a producer make an election under paragraph (1)(B) for a crop year, the Corporation shall assign the producer a recorded yield for that crop year for the first crop equal to 60 percent of the producer’s actual production history for the agricultural commodity involved, for purposes of determining the producer’s actual production history for subsequent crop years.

(4) Area conditions required for payment

The Corporation shall limit prevented planting payments for producers to those situations in which other producers, in the area where a first crop is prevented from being planted is located, are also generally affected by the conditions that prevented the first crop from being planted.

(5) Planting date

If a producer plants the second crop before the latest planting date established by the Corporation for the first crop, the Corporation shall not make a prevented planting payment with regard to the first crop.
