### CHAPTER 36— CROP INSURANCE
#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (m) Quality loss adjustment coverage

(1) Effect of coverage

If a policy or plan of insurance offered under this subchapter includes quality loss adjustment coverage, the coverage shall provide for a reduction in the quantity of production of the agricultural commodity considered produced during a crop year, or a similar adjustment, as a result of the agricultural commodity not meeting the quality standards established in the policy or plan of insurance.

(2) Additional quality loss adjustment

(A) Producer option

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to the quality loss adjustment coverage available under paragraph (1), the Corporation shall offer producers the option of purchasing quality loss adjustment coverage on a basis that is smaller than a unit with respect to an agricultural commodity that satisfies each of the following:

(i) The agricultural commodity is sold on an identity-preserved basis.

(ii) All quality determinations are made solely by the Federal agency designated to grade or classify the agricultural commodity.

(iii) All quality determinations are made in accordance with standards published by the Federal agency in the Federal Register.

(iv) The discount schedules that reflect the reduction in quality of the agricultural commodity are established by the Secretary.

(B) Basis for adjustment

Under this paragraph, the Corporation shall set the quality standards below which quality losses will be paid based on the variability of the grade of the agricultural commodity from the base quality for the agricultural commodity.

(3) Review of criteria and procedures

(A) Review

The Corporation shall contract with a qualified person to review the quality loss adjustment procedures of the Corporation so that the procedures more accurately reflect local quality discounts that are applied to agricultural commodities insured under this subchapter.

(B) Procedures

Effective beginning not later than the 2004 reinsurance year, based on the review, the Corporation shall make adjustments in the procedures, taking into consideration the actuarial soundness of the adjustment and the prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse.

(4) Quality of agricultural commodities delivered to warehouse operators

In administering this subchapter, the Secretary shall accept, in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions, evidence of the quality of agricultural commodities delivered to

(A) warehouse operators that are licensed under the United States Warehouse Act ( 7 U.S.C. 241 et seq.);

(B) warehouse operators that

(i) are licensed under State law; and

(ii) have entered into a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; and

(C) warehouse operators that

(i) are not licensed under State law but are in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and

(ii) have entered into a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation.

(5) Special provisions for malting barley

The Corporation shall promulgate special provisions under this subsection specific to malting barley, taking into consideration any changes in quality factors, as required by applicable market conditions.

(6) Test weight for corn

(A) In general

The Corporation shall establish procedures to allow insured producers not more than 120 days to settle claims, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, involving corn that is determined to have low test weight.

(B) Implementation

As soon as practicable after February 7, 2014 , the Corporation shall implement subparagraph (A) on a regional basis based on market conditions and the interests of producers.

(C) Termination of effectiveness

The authority provided by this paragraph terminates effective on the date that is 5 years after the date on which subparagraph (A) is implemented.
