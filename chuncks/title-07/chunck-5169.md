##### (j) Contracts and agreements

(1) Authority

To ensure coordination and efficient use of funds, the order shall provide that the Board may enter into contracts or agreements for the implementation and carrying out of the activities authorized by this chapter with national, nonprofit, producer-governed organizations that represent producers of soybeans, and for the payment thereof with funds received by the Board under the order.

(2) Coordination

To enhance coordination, the Board, when entering into contracts or agreements for the implementation and carrying out of activities authorized by this chapter, shall ensure that all plans or projects implemented for consumer information, industry information, promotion, or research are each implemented by a single entity. There shall not be in force, at any one time, more than one contract or agreement for implementation of plans or projects for consumer information, for industry information, for promotion, or for research, except that, upon approval of the Secretary, the Board may contract with qualified State soybean boards to implement plans or projects within their respective States.

(3) Terms

Any contract or agreement entered into under this subsection shall provide that

(A) the contracting party shall develop and submit to the Board a plan or project together with a budget or budgets that shall show estimated costs to be incurred for such plan or project;

(B) the plan or project shall not become effective until it has been approved by the Secretary; and

(C) the contracting party shall keep accurate records of all of its transactions, account for funds received and expended, including staff time, salaries, and expenses expended on behalf of Board activities, make periodic reports to the Board of activities conducted, and make such other reports as the Board or the Secretary may require.

(4) Communications to producers

The order may provide that

(A) the Board may enter into contracts or agreements with qualified State soybean boards that apply therefor and agree to the terms thereof, for the implementation of plans or projects to coordinate and facilitate communications to producers regarding the conduct of activities under the order and for the payment of the costs of the plans or projects with funds received by the Board under the order; and

(B) to facilitate the funding of plans or projects described in subparagraph (A), if the order does not authorize the payment of refunds, the Board shall allocate for such funding each year an amount not less than the cumulative amount of all producer contributions to qualified State soybean boards during the previous year that the State boards were unable to retain, and forwarded to the Board, because producers received refunds on such State contributions, as determined by the Board based on information submitted by the qualified State soybean boards.

(5) Apportionment of funds to qualified State soybean boards

(A) In general

In using the funds allocated each year under paragraph (4)(B) for payment of the costs of contracts or agreements described in paragraph (4)(A), subject to subparagraph (B), the Board shall apportion such allocated funds among States so that each qualified State soybean board receives an amount equal to the amount of such allocated funds attributable to refunds in the State during the previous year, as determined by the Board based on information submitted by the qualified State soybean boards.

(B) Exception

The Board shall not be required to apportion funds to a qualified State soybean board, as provided in subparagraph (A), if

(i) the qualified State soybean board has not entered into a contract or agreement with the Board for the implementation of plans or projects described in paragraph (4)(A); or

(ii) the amount to be apportioned to the qualified State soybean board is less than the cost to the Board of overseeing the use of such apportionment during the year involved, and the contract or agreement shall so provide.
