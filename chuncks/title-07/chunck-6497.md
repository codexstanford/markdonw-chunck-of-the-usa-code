#### § 7952. Establishment of payment yield and base acres for peanuts for a farm
##### (a) Average yield and acreage average for historic peanut producers

(1) Determination of average yield

(A) In general

The Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the average yield for peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the producer did not plant or was prevented from planting peanuts.

(B) Assigned yields

For the purposes of determining the 4-year average yield for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the historic peanut producer may elect to substitute for a farm, for not more than 3 of the 1998 through 2001 crop years in which the producer planted peanuts on the farm, the average yield for peanuts produced in the county in which the farm is located for the 1990 through 1997 crop years.

(2) Determination of acreage average

(A) In general

The Secretary shall determine, for each historic peanut producer, the 4-year average of the following:

(i) Acreage planted to peanuts on each farm on which the historic peanut producer planted peanuts for harvest for the 1998 through 2001 crop years.

(ii) Any acreage on each farm that the historic peanut producer was prevented from planting to peanuts during the 1998 through 2001 crop years because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the historic peanut producer, as determined by the Secretary.

(B) Inclusion of all 4 years in average

For the purposes of determining the 4-year acreage average for an historic peanut producer under this paragraph, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in which the producer did not plant peanuts.

(C) Proportional shares

If more than 1 historic peanut producer shared in the risk of producing the crop on a farm, the historic peanut producers shall receive their proportional share of the number of acres planted (or prevented from being planted) to peanuts for harvest on the farm based on the sharing arrangement that was in effect among the producers for the crop.

(3) Time for determinations

The Secretary shall make the determinations required by this subsection as soon as practicable after May 13, 2002 .

(4) Special considerations

In making the determinations required by this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account changes in the number, identity, or interest of producers sharing in the risk of producing a peanut crop since the 1998 crop year, including providing a method for the assignment of average acres and average yield to a farm

(A) when an historic peanut producer is no longer living;

(B) when an entity composed of historic peanut producers has been dissolved; or

(C) in other appropriate situations, as determined by the Secretary.
