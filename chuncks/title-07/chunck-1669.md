### CHAPTER 35A— PRICE SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES
#### § 1421. Price support
##### (c) Compliance by producer; program for diverted acres

Compliance by the producer with acreage allotments, production goals and marketing practices (including marketing quotas when authorized by law), prescribed by the Secretary, may be required as a condition of eligibility for price support. In administering any program for diverted acres the Secretary may make his regulations applicable on an appropriate geographical basis. Such regulations shall be administered (1) in semiarid or other areas where good husbandry requires maintenance of a prudent feed reserve in such manner as to permit, to the extent so required by good husbandry, the production of forage crops for storage and subsequent use either on the farm or in feeding operations of the farm operator, and (2) in areas declared to be disaster areas by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [ 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], in such manner as will most quickly restore the normal pattern of their agriculture.
