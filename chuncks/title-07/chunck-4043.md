#### § 3157. Competitive, special, and facilities research grants
##### (e) Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4

(1) The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish an Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4 (hereinafter referred to in this subsection as the “IR–4 Program”) to assist in the collection of residue and efficacy data in support of

(A) the registration or reregistration of pesticides for minor agricultural use and for use on specialty crops (as defined in section 3 of the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 ( 7 U.S.C. 1621 note)), under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act ( 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.); and

(B) tolerances for residues of minor use chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities under sections 346a and 348 of title 21.

(2) The Secretary shall carry out the IR–4 Program in cooperation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, State agricultural experiment stations, colleges and universities, extension services, private industry, and other interested parties.

(3) In carrying out the IR–4 Program, the Secretary shall give priority to registrations, reregistrations, and tolerances for pesticide uses related to the production of agricultural crops for food use.

(4) As part of carrying out the IR–4 Program, the Secretary shall

(A) participate in research activities aimed at reducing residues of pesticides registered for minor agricultural use and for use on specialty crops;

(B) develop analytical techniques applicable to residues of pesticides registered for minor agricultural use, including automation techniques and validation of analytical methods;

(C) prioritize potential pest management technology for minor agricultural use and for use on specialty crops;

(D) conduct research to develop the data necessary to facilitate pesticide registrations, reregistrations, and associated tolerances;

(E) assist in removing trade barriers caused by residues of pesticides registered for minor agricultural use and for use on domestically grown specialty crops;

(F) assist in the registration and reregistration of pest management technologies for minor agricultural use and for use on specialty crops; and

(G) coordinate with other programs within the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency designed to develop and promote biological and other alternative control measures.

(5) The Secretary shall prepare and submit, to appropriate Committees of Congress, a report on an annual basis that contains

(A) a listing of all registrations, reregistrations, and tolerances for which data has been collected in the preceding year;

(B) a listing of all registrations, reregistrations, and tolerances for which data collection is scheduled to occur in the following year, with an explanation of the priority system used to develop this list; and

(C) a listing of all activities the IR–4 Program has carried out pursuant to paragraph (4).

(6) The Secretary shall submit to Congress not later than November 28, 1991 , a report detailing the feasibility of requiring recoupment of the costs of developing residue data for registrations, reregistrations, or tolerances under this program. Such recoupment shall only apply to those registrants which make a profit on such registration, reregistration, or tolerance subsequent to residue data development under this program. Such report shall include:

(A) an analysis of possible benefits to the IR–4 Program of such a recoupment;

(B) an analysis of the impact of such a payment on the availability of registrants to pursue registrations or reregistrations of minor use pesticides; and

(C) recommendations for implementation of such a recoupment policy.

(7) There are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1991, and such sums as are necessary for subsequent fiscal years to carry out this subsection.
