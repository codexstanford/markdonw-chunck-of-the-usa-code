#### § 7912. Establishment of payment yield
##### (d) Payment yields for oilseeds

(1) Determination of average yield

In the case of soybeans and each other oilseed, the Secretary shall determine the average yield per planted acre for the oilseed on a farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the oilseed was zero.

(2) Adjustment for payment yield

The payment yield for a farm for an oilseed shall be equal to the product of the following:

(A) The average yield for the oilseed determined under paragraph (1).

(B) The ratio resulting from dividing the national average yield for the oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 crops by the national average yield for the oilseed for the 1998 through 2001 crops.

(3) Use of partial county average yield

If the yield per planted acre for a crop of an oilseed for a farm for any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of the county yield for that oilseed, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the county yield for the purpose of determining the average under paragraph (1).
