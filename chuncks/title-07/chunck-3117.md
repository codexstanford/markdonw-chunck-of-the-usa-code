### CHAPTER 51— SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
#### § 2014. Eligible households
##### (g) Allowable financial resources

(1) Total amount.

(A) In general .

The Secretary shall prescribe the types and allowable amounts of financial resources (liquid and nonliquid assets) an eligible household may own, and shall, in so doing, assure that a household otherwise eligible to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program will not be eligible to participate if its resources exceed $2,000 (as adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)), or, in the case of a household which consists of or includes an elderly or disabled member, if its resources exceed $3,000 (as adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)).

(B) Adjustment for inflation.

(i) In general .

Beginning on October 1, 2008 , and each October 1 thereafter, the amounts specified in subparagraph (A) shall be adjusted and rounded down to the nearest $250 increment to reflect changes for the 12-month period ending the preceding June in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

(ii) Requirement .

Each adjustment under clause (i) shall be based on the unrounded amount for the prior 12-month period.

(2) Included assets.

(A) In general .

Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, in prescribing inclusions in, and exclusions from, financial resources, follow the regulations in force as of June 1, 1982 (other than those relating to licensed vehicles and inaccessible resources).

(B) Additional included assets .

The Secretary shall include in financial resources

(i) any boat, snowmobile, or airplane used for recreational purposes;

(ii) any vacation home;

(iii) any mobile home used primarily for vacation purposes;

(iv) subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), any licensed vehicle that is used for household transportation or to obtain or continue employment to the extent that the fair market value of the vehicle exceeds $4,650; and

(v) any savings account, regardless of whether there is a penalty for early withdrawal.

(C) Excluded vehicles .

A vehicle (and any other property, real or personal, to the extent the property is directly related to the maintenance or use of the vehicle) shall not be included in financial resources under this paragraph if the vehicle is

(i) used to produce earned income;

(ii) necessary for the transportation of a physically disabled household member; or

(iii) depended on by a household to carry fuel for heating or water for home use and provides the primary source of fuel or water, respectively, for the household.

(D) Alternative vehicle allowance .

If the vehicle allowance standards that a State agency uses to determine eligibility for assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) would result in a lower attribution of resources to certain households than under subparagraph (B)(iv), in lieu of applying subparagraph (B)(iv), the State agency may elect to apply the State vehicle allowance standards to all households that would incur a lower attribution of resources under the State vehicle allowance standards.

(3) The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of a burial plot for each member of a household and nonliquid resources necessary to allow the household to carry out a plan for self-sufficiency approved by the State agency that constitutes adequate participation in an employment and training program under section 2015(d) of this title or a pilot project under section 2025(h)(1)(F) of this title . The Secretary shall also exclude from financial resources any earned income tax credits received by any member of the household for a period of 12 months from receipt if such member was participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance program at the time the credits were received and participated in such program continuously during the 12-month period.

(4) In the case of farm property (including land, equipment, and supplies) that is essential to the self-employment of a household member in a farming operation, the Secretary shall exclude from financial resources the value of such property until the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date such member ceases to be self-employed in farming.

(5) The Secretary shall promulgate rules by which State agencies shall develop standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the household is unlikely to be able to sell for any significant return because the household’s interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household’s interest would be relatively great. Resources so identified shall be excluded as inaccessible resources. A resource shall be so identified if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The Secretary shall not require the State agency to require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded under this paragraph unless the State agency determines that the information provided by the household is questionable.

(6) Exclusion of types of financial resources not considered under certain other federal programs.

(A) In general .

Subject to subparagraph (B), a State agency may, at the option of the State agency, exclude from financial resources under this subsection any types of financial resources that the State agency does not consider when determining eligibility for

(i) cash assistance under a program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); or

(ii) medical assistance under section 1931 of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396u–1 ).

(B) Limitations .

Except to the extent that any of the types of resources specified in clauses (i) through (iv) are excluded under another paragraph of this subsection, subparagraph (A) does not authorize a State agency to exclude

(i) cash;

(ii) licensed vehicles;

(iii) amounts in any account in a financial institution that are readily available to the household; or

(iv) any other similar type of resource the inclusion in financial resources of which the Secretary determines by regulation to be essential to equitable determinations of eligibility under the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

(7) Exclusion of retirement accounts from allowable financial resources.

(A) Mandatory exclusions .

The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources under this subsection the value of

(i) any funds in a plan, contract, or account, described in sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, 457(b), and 501(c)(18) of title 26 and the value of funds in a Federal Thrift Savings Plan account as provided in section 8439 of title 5 ; and

(ii) any retirement program or account included in any successor or similar provision that may be enacted and determined to be exempt from tax under title 26.

(B) Discretionary exclusions .

The Secretary may exclude from financial resources under this subsection the value of any other retirement plans, contracts, or accounts (as determined by the Secretary).

(8) Exclusion of education accounts from allowable financial resources.

(A) Mandatory exclusions .

The Secretary shall exclude from financial resources under this subsection the value of any funds in a qualified tuition program described in section 529 of title 26 or in a Coverdell education savings account under section 530 of that title.

(B) Discretionary exclusions .

The Secretary may exclude from financial resources under this subsection the value of any other education programs, contracts, or accounts (as determined by the Secretary).
