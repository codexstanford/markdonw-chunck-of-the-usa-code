#### § 3405. Wheat Industry Council
##### (e) Processed wheat assessment; payment by end product manufacturers

that, except as provided in sections 3404(d) and 3406 of this title, each end product manufacturer shall pay to the Council, pursuant to regulations issued under the order, an assessment based on the number of hundredweights of processed wheat purchased, including intra-company transfers of processed wheat, for use in the manufacture of end products, from processors, distributors, or (in the case of intra-company transfers) related companies or divisions of the same company. Such assessment shall be used for such expenses and expenditures defined above, including provisions for a reasonable reserve, and any referendum and administrative costs incurred by the Secretary and the Council under this chapter, as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred under the order during any period specified by the Secretary. The circumstances under which such a purchase or intra-company transfer will be deemed to have occurred will be prescribed by the Secretary in the order. Such assessment shall be calculated and set aside on the books and records of the end product manufacturer at the time of each purchase or intra-company transfer of processed wheat, and shall be remitted to the Council in the manner prescribed by the order. In order to enable end product manufacturers to calculate the amount of processed wheat they have purchased, persons selling or transferring processed wheat in combination with other ingredients to such end product manufacturers for use in the manufacture of end products, shall disclose to such end product manufacturers, as prescribed by the Secretary in the order, the amount or proportion of processed wheat contained in such products. The rate of assessment shall not exceed five cents per hundredweight of processed wheat purchased or transferred. The Secretary may maintain a suit against any person subject to such assessment for the collection of such assessment, and the several district courts of the United States are hereby vested with jurisdiction to entertain such suits regardless of the amount in controversy;
