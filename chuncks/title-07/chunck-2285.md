#### § 1726c. Local and regional food aid procurement projects
##### (c) Procurement

(1) In general

Any eligible commodity that is procured for a field-based project carried out under subsection (b) shall be procured through any approach or methodology that the Secretary considers to be an effective approach or methodology to provide adequate information regarding the manner by which to expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the provision of food aid to affected populations without significantly increasing commodity costs for low-income consumers who procure commodities sourced from the same markets at which the eligible commodity is procured.

(2) Requirements

(A) Impact on local farmers and countries

The Secretary shall ensure that the local or regional procurement of any eligible commodity under this section will not have a disruptive impact on farmers located in, or the economy of

(i) the recipient country of the eligible commodity; or

(ii) any country in the region in which the eligible commodity may be procured.

(B) Transshipment

The Secretary shall, in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers to be appropriate, require from each eligible organization commitments designed to prevent or restrict

(i) the resale or transshipment of any eligible commodity procured under this section to any country other than the recipient country; and

(ii) the use of the eligible commodity for any purpose other than food aid.

(C) World prices

(i) In general

In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall take any precaution that the Secretary considers to be reasonable to ensure that the procurement of eligible commodities will not unduly disrupt

(I) world prices for agricultural commodities; or

(II) normal patterns of commercial trade with foreign countries.

(ii) Procurement price

The procurement of any eligible commodity shall be made at a reasonable market price with respect to the economy of the country in which the eligible commodity is procured, as determined by the Secretary.
