### CHAPTER 84— NATIONAL NUTRITION MONITORING AND RELATED RESEARCH
#### § 5313. Development of comprehensive plan for National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Program
##### (b) Components of plan

The comprehensive plan, at a minimum, shall include components to

(1) maintain and coordinate the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS);

(2) provide, by 1991, for the continuous collection, processing, and analysis of nutritional and dietary status data through stratified probability samples of the people of the United States designed to permit statistically reliable estimates of high-risk groups and geographic areas, and to permit accelerated data analysis (including annual analysis, as appropriate);

(3) maintain and enhance other Federal nutrition monitoring efforts such as the Centers for Disease Control Nutrition Surveillance Program and the Food and Drug Administration Total Diet Study, and, to the extent possible, coordinate such efforts with the surveys described in paragraphs (1) and (2);

(4) incorporate, in survey design, military and (where appropriate) institutionalized populations;

(5) complete the analysis and interpretation of the data sets from the surveys described in paragraph (1) collected prior to 1984 within the first year of the comprehensive plan;

(6) improve the methodologies and technologies, including those suitable for use by States and localities, available for the assessment of nutritional and dietary status and trends;

(7) develop uniform standards and indicators for the assessment and monitoring of nutritional and dietary status, for relating food consumption patterns to nutritional and health status, and for use in the evaluation of Federal food and nutrition intervention programs;

(8) establish national baseline data and procedures for nutrition monitoring;

(9) provide scientific and technical assistance, training, and consultation to State and local governments for the purpose of

(A) obtaining dietary and nutrition status data;

(B) developing related data bases; and

(C) promoting the development of regional, State, and local data collection services to become an integral component of a national nutritional status network;

(10) establish mechanisms to identify the needs of users of nutrition monitoring data and to encourage the private sector and the academic community to participate in the development and implementation of the comprehensive plan and contribute relevant data from non-Federal sources to promote the development of a national nutritional status network;

(11) compile an inventory of Federal, State, and nongovernment activities related to nutrition monitoring and related research;

(12) focus on national nutrition monitoring needs while building on the responsibilities and expertise of the individual membership of the Board;

(13) administer the coordinated program, define program objectives, priorities, oversight, responsibilities, and resources, and define the organization and management of the Board and the Council; and

(14) provide a mechanism for periodically evaluating and refining the coordinated program and the comprehensive plan that facilitates cooperation and interaction by State and local governments, the private sector, scientific communities, and health care professionals, and that facilitates coordination with non-Federal activities.
