#### § 9014. Payment acres
##### (b) Treatment of generic base acres

(1) In general

In the case of generic base acres, price loss coverage payments and agriculture risk coverage payments are made only with respect to generic base acres planted to a covered commodity for the crop year.

(2) Attribution

With respect to a farm containing generic base acres, for the purpose of applying paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), generic base acres on the farm are attributed to a covered commodity in the following manner:

(A) If a single covered commodity is planted and the total acreage planted exceeds the generic base acres on the farm, the generic base acres are attributed to that covered commodity in an amount equal to the total number of generic base acres.

(B) If multiple covered commodities are planted and the total number of acres planted to all covered commodities on the farm exceeds the generic base acres on the farm, the generic base acres are attributed to each of the covered commodities on the farm on a pro rata basis to reflect the ratio of

(i) the acreage planted to a covered commodity on the farm; to

(ii) the total acreage planted to all covered commodities on the farm.

(C) If the total number of acres planted to all covered commodities on the farm does not exceed the generic base acres on the farm, the number of acres planted to a covered commodity is attributed to that covered commodity.

(3) Treated as additional acreage

When generic base acres are planted to a covered commodity or acreage planted to a covered commodity is attributed to generic base acres, the generic base acres are in addition to other base acres on the farm.

(4) Seed cotton

(A) In general

Not later than 90 days after February 9, 2018 , the Secretary shall require the owner of a farm to allocate all generic base acres on the farm under subparagraph (B) or (C), or both.

(B) No recent history of covered commodities

In the case of a farm on which no covered commodities (including seed cotton) were planted or were prevented from being planted at any time during the 2009 through 2016 crop years, the owner of such farm shall allocate generic base acres on the farm to unassigned crop base for which no payments may be made under section 9016 or 9017 of this title.

(C) Recent history of covered commodities

In the case of a farm not described in subparagraph (B), the owner of such farm shall allocate generic base acres on the farm

(i) subject to subparagraph (D), to seed cotton base acres in a quantity equal to the greater of

(I) 80 percent of the generic base acres on the farm; or

(II) the average number of seed cotton acres planted or prevented from being planted on the farm during the 2009 through 2012 crop years (not to exceed the total generic base acres on the farm); or

(ii) to base acres for covered commodities (including seed cotton), by applying subparagraphs (B), (D), (E), and (F) of section 9012(a)(3) of this title .

(D) Treatment of residual generic base acres

In the case of a farm on which generic base acres are allocated under subparagraph (C)(i), the residual generic base acres shall be allocated to unassigned crop base for which no payments may be made under section 9016 or 9017 of this title.

(E) Effect of failure to allocate

In the case of a farm not described in subparagraph (B) for which the owner of the farm fails to make an election under subparagraph (C), the owner of the farm shall be deemed to have elected to allocate all generic base acres in accordance with subparagraph (C)(i).
