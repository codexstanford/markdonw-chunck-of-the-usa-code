#### § 9017. Agriculture risk coverage
##### (g) Additional duties of the Secretary

In providing agriculture risk coverage, the Secretary shall

(1) to the maximum extent practicable, use all available information and analysis, including data mining, to check for anomalies in the determination of agriculture risk coverage payments;

(2) calculate a separate actual crop revenue and agriculture risk coverage guarantee for irrigated and nonirrigated covered commodities;

(3) in the case of individual coverage, assign an average yield for a farm on the basis of the yield history of representative farms in the State, region, or crop reporting district, as determined by the Secretary, if the Secretary determines that the farm has planted acreage in a quantity that is insufficient to calculate a representative average yield for the farm;

(4) effective for the 2014 through 2018 crop years, in the case of county coverage, assign an actual or benchmark county yield for each planted acre for the crop year for the covered commodity on the basis of the yield history of representative farms in the State, region, or crop reporting district, as determined by the Secretary, if

(A) the Secretary cannot establish the actual or benchmark county yield for each planted acre for a crop year for a covered commodity in the county in accordance with subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2); or

(B) the yield determined under subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2) is an unrepresentative average yield for the county, as determined by the Secretary; and

(5) effective for the 2019 through 2023 crop years, in the case of county coverage, assign an actual or benchmark county yield for each planted acre for the crop year for the covered commodity

(A) for a county for which county data collected by the Risk Management Agency are sufficient for the Secretary to offer a county-wide insurance product, using the actual average county yield determined by the Risk Management Agency; or

(B) for a county not described in subparagraph (A), using

(i) other sources of yield information, as determined by the Secretary; or

(ii) the yield history of representative farms in the State, region, or crop reporting district, as determined by the Secretary.
