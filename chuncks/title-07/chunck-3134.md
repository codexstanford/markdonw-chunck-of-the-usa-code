#### § 2015. Eligibility disqualifications
##### (i) Comparable treatment for disqualification

(1) In general

If a disqualification is imposed on a member of a household for a failure of the member to perform an action required under a Federal, State, or local law relating to a means-tested public assistance program, the State agency may impose the same disqualification on the member of the household under the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

(2) Rules and procedures

If a disqualification is imposed under paragraph (1) for a failure of an individual to perform an action required under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the State agency may use the rules and procedures that apply under part A of title IV of the Act to impose the same disqualification under the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

(3) Application after disqualification period

A member of a household disqualified under paragraph (1) may, after the disqualification period has expired, apply for benefits under this chapter and shall be treated as a new applicant, except that a prior disqualification under subsection (d) shall be considered in determining eligibility.
