### CHAPTER 41— FOOD FOR PEACE
#### § 1736o. Food for progress
##### (d) Consideration for agreements

In determining whether to enter into an agreement under this section, the Secretary shall consider whether a potential recipient country is committed to carry out, or is carrying out, policies that promote economic freedom, private, domestic production of eligible commodities for domestic consumption, and the creation and expansion of efficient domestic markets for the purchase and sale of such eligible commodities. Such policies may provide for, among other things

(1) access, on the part of farmers in the country, to private, competitive markets for their product;

(2) market pricing of eligible commodities to foster adequate private sector incentives to individual farmers to produce food on a regular basis for the country’s domestic needs;

(3) establishment of market-determined foreign exchange rates;

(4) timely availability of production inputs (such as seed, fertilizer, or pesticides) to farmers;

(5) access to technologies appropriate to the level of agricultural development in the country; and

(6) construction of facilities and distribution systems necessary to handle perishable products.
