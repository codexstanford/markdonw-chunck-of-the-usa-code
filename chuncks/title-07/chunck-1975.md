#### § 1531. Supplemental agricultural disaster assistance
##### (b) Supplemental revenue assistance payments

(1) Payments

(A) In general

The Secretary shall use such sums as are necessary from the Trust Fund to make crop disaster assistance payments to eligible producers on farms in disaster counties that have incurred crop production losses or crop quality losses, or both, during the crop year.

(B) Crop loss

To be eligible for crop loss assistance under this subsection, the actual production on the farm for at least 1 crop of economic significance shall be reduced by at least 10 percent due to disaster, adverse weather, or disaster-related conditions.

(2) Amount

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall provide crop disaster assistance payments under this section to an eligible producer on a farm in an amount equal to 60 percent of the difference between

(i) the disaster assistance program guarantee, as described in paragraph (3); and

(ii) the total farm revenue for a farm, as described in paragraph (4).

(B) Limitation

The disaster assistance program guarantee for a crop used to calculate the payments for a farm under subparagraph (A)(i) may not be greater than 90 percent of the sum of the expected revenue, as described in paragraph (5) for each of the crops on a farm, as determined by the Secretary.

(C) Exclusion of subsequently planted crops

In calculating the disaster assistance program guarantee under paragraph (3) and the total farm revenue under paragraph (4), the Secretary shall not consider the value of any crop that

(i) is produced on land that is not eligible for a policy or plan of insurance under subchapter I or assistance under the noninsured crop assistance program; or

(ii) is subsequently planted on the same land during the same crop year as the crop for which disaster assistance is provided under this subsection, except in areas in which double-cropping is a normal practice, as determined by the Secretary.

(3) Supplemental revenue assistance program guarantee

(A) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the supplemental assistance program guarantee shall be the sum obtained by adding

(i) for each insurable commodity on the farm, 115 percent of the product obtained by multiplying

(I) a payment rate for the commodity that is equal to the price election for the commodity elected by the eligible producer;

(II) the payment acres for the commodity that is equal to the number of acres planted, or prevented from being planted, to the commodity;

(III) the payment yield for the commodity that is equal to the percentage of the crop insurance yield elected by the producer of the higher of

(aa) the adjusted actual production history yield; or

(bb) the counter-cyclical program payment yield for each crop; and

(ii) for each noninsurable commodity on a farm, 120 percent of the product obtained by multiplying

(I) a payment rate for the commodity that is equal to 100 percent of the noninsured crop assistance program established price for the commodity;

(II) the payment acres for the commodity that is equal to the number of acres planted, or prevented from being planted, to the commodity; and

(III) the payment yield for the commodity that is equal to 50 percent of the higher of

(aa) the adjusted noninsured crop assistance program yield; or

(bb) the counter-cyclical program payment yield for each crop.

(B) Adjustment insurance guarantee

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of an insurable commodity for which a plan of insurance provides for an adjustment in the guarantee, such as in the case of prevented planting, the adjusted insurance guarantee shall be the basis for determining the disaster assistance program guarantee for the insurable commodity.

(C) Adjusted assistance level

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of a noninsurable commodity for which the noninsured crop assistance program provides for an adjustment in the level of assistance, such as in the case of unharvested crops, the adjusted assistance level shall be the basis for determining the disaster assistance program guarantee for the noninsurable commodity.

(D) Equitable treatment for non-yield based policies

The Secretary shall establish equitable treatment for non-yield based policies and plans of insurance, such as the Adjusted Gross Revenue Lite insurance program.

(4) Farm revenue

(A) In general

For purposes of this subsection, the total farm revenue for a farm, 2 shall equal the sum obtained by adding

(i) the estimated actual value for each crop produced on a farm by using the product obtained by multiplying

(I) the actual production by crop on a farm for purposes of determining losses under subchapter I or the noninsured crop assistance program; and

(II) subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), to the extent practicable, the national average market price received for the marketing year, as determined by the Secretary;

(ii) 15 percent of amount of any direct payments made to the producer under sections 1103 and 1303  1 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 [ 7 U.S.C. 8713 , 8753] or successor sections;

(iii) the total amount of any counter-cyclical payments made to the producer under sections 1104 and 1304  1 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 [ 7 U.S.C. 8714 , 8754] or successor sections or of any average crop revenue election payments made to the producer under section 1105  1 of that Act [ 7 U.S.C. 8715 ];

(iv) the total amount of any loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and marketing certificate gains made to the producer under subtitles B and C  1 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 [ 7 U.S.C. 8731 et seq., 8751 et seq.] or successor subtitles;

(v) the amount of payments for prevented planting on a farm;

(vi) the amount of crop insurance indemnities received by an eligible producer on a farm for each crop on a farm;

(vii) the amount of payments an eligible producer on a farm received under the noninsured crop assistance program for each crop on a farm; and

(viii) the value of any other natural disaster assistance payments provided by the Federal Government to an eligible producer on a farm for each crop on a farm for the same loss for which the eligible producer is seeking assistance.

(B) Adjustment

The Secretary shall adjust the average market price received by the eligible producer on a farm

(i) to reflect the average quality discounts applied to the local or regional market price of a crop or mechanically harvested forage due to a reduction in the intrinsic characteristics of the production resulting from adverse weather, as determined annually by the State office of the Farm Service Agency;

(ii) to account for a crop the value of which is reduced due to excess moisture resulting from a disaster-related condition; and

(iii) as the Secretary determines appropriate, to reflect regional variations in a manner consistent with the operation of the crop insurance program under subchapter I and the noninsured crop assistance program.

(C) Maximum amount for certain crops

With respect to a crop for which an eligible producer on a farm receives assistance under the noninsured crop assistance program, the national average market price received during the marketing year shall be an amount not more than 100 percent of the price of the crop established under the noninsured crop assistance program.

(5) Expected revenue

The expected revenue for each crop on a farm shall equal

(A) for each insurable commodity, the product obtained by multiplying

(i) the greater of

(I) the adjusted actual production history yield of the eligible producer on a farm; and

(II) the counter-cyclical program payment yield;

(ii) the acreage planted or prevented from being planted for each crop; and

(iii) 100 percent of the price election for the commodity used to calculate an indemnity for an applicable policy of insurance if an indemnity is triggered; and

(B) for each noninsurable crop, the product obtained by multiplying

(i) 100 percent of the adjusted noninsured crop assistance program yield;

(ii) the acreage planted or prevented from being planted for each crop; and

(iii) 100 percent of the noninsured crop assistance program price for each of the crops on a farm.

(6) Production on the farm

(I) 100 percent of the price election for the commodity used to calculate an indemnity for an applicable policy of insurance if an indemnity is triggered; and

(II) the quantity of the commodity produced on the farm, adjusted for quality losses; and

(ii) for each noninsurable commodity on a farm, the product obtained by multiplying

(I) 100 percent of the noninsured crop assistance program established price for the commodity; and

(II) the quantity of the commodity produced on the farm, adjusted for quality losses.
