(ii) in assisting in any investigation or judicial or administrative action of the Commission based upon or related to such information.

(B) Enforcement

(i) Cause of action

An individual who alleges discharge or other discrimination in violation of subparagraph (A) may bring an action under this subsection in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in subparagraph (C), unless the individual who is alleging discharge or other discrimination in violation of subparagraph (A) is an employee of the Federal Government, in which case the individual shall only bring an action under section 1221 of title 5 .

An action under this subsection may not be brought more than 2 years after the date on which the violation reported in subparagraph (A) is committed.

(C) Relief

Relief for an individual prevailing in an action brought under subparagraph (B) shall include

(i) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the individual would have had, but for the discrimination;

(ii) the amount of back pay otherwise owed to the individual, with interest; and

For purposes of section 552 of title 5 , this paragraph shall be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such section 552.
