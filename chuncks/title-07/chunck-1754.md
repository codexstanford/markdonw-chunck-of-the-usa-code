(1) For purposes of this subsection, extra long staple cotton means cotton which is produced from pure strain varieties of the Barbadense species or any hybrid thereof, or other similar types of extra long staple cotton, designated by the Secretary, having characteristics needed for various end uses for which American upland cotton is not suitable and grown in irrigated cotton-growing regions of the United States designated by the Secretary or other areas designated by the Secretary as suitable for the production of such varieties or types and which is ginned on a roller-type gin or, if authorized by the Secretary, ginned on another type gin for experimental purposes.

(2) The Secretary shall, upon presentation of warehouse receipts reflecting accrued storage charges of not more than sixty days, make available to producers nonrecourse loans for a term of ten months from the first day of the month in which the loan is made at a level which is not less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by producers of extra long staple cotton, as determined by the Secretary, during 3 years of the 5-year period ending July 31 in the year in which the loan level is announced, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period.. 2 If authorized by the Secretary, nonrecourse loans provided for in this subsection may, upon request of the producer during the tenth month of the loan period for the cotton, be made available for an additional term of eight months. The loan level for any crop of extra long staple cotton shall be determined and announced by the Secretary not later than December 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which such loan is to be effective and such level shall not thereafter be changed.
