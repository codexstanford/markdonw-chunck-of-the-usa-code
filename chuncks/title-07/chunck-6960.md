#### § 9013. Payment yields
##### (b) Payment yields for designated oilseeds

(1) Determination of average yield

In the case of oilseeds designated before December 20, 2018 , the Secretary shall determine the average yield per planted acre for the designated oilseed on a farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the designated oilseed was zero.

(2) Adjustment for payment yield

(A) In general

The payment yield for a farm for an oilseed designated before December 20, 2018 , shall be equal to the product of the following:

(i) The average yield for the designated oilseed determined under paragraph (1).

(ii) The ratio resulting from dividing the national average yield for the designated oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 crops by the national average yield for the designated oilseed for the 1998 through 2001 crops.

(B) No national average yield information available

To the extent that national average yield information for an oilseed designated before December 20, 2018 , is not available, the Secretary shall use such information as the Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to establish a national average yield under this section.

(3) Use of county average yield

If the yield per planted acre for a crop of an oilseed designated before December 20, 2018 , for a farm for any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of the county yield for that designated oilseed, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the county yield for the purpose of determining the average under paragraph (1).

(4) Treatment of oilseeds designated after certain date

In the case of oilseeds designated on or after December 20, 2018 , the payment yield shall be equal to 90 percent of the average of the yield per planted acre for the most recent 5 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the covered commodity was zero.
