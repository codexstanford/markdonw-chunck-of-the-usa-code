### CHAPTER 50— AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
#### § 1985. Security servicing
##### (f) Normal security income

(1) As used in this subsection, the term “normal income security” means all security not considered basic security, including crops, livestock, poultry products, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service payments and Commodity Credit Corporation payments, and other property covered by Farmers Home Administration liens that is sold in conjunction with the operation of a farm or other business, but shall not include any equipment (including fixtures in States that have adopted the Uniform Commercial Code), or foundation herd or flock, that is the basis of the farming or other operation, and is the basic security for a Farmers Home Administration farmer program loan.

(2) The Secretary shall release from the normal income security provided for such loan an amount sufficient to pay for the essential household and farm operating expenses of the borrower, until such time as the Secretary accelerates such loan.

(3) A borrower whose account was accelerated on or after November 1, 1985 , and on or before May 7, 1987 , but not thereafter foreclosed on or liquidated, shall be entitled to the release of security income for a period of 12 months, to pay the essential household and farm operating expenses of such borrower in an amount not to exceed $18,000 over 12 months, if such borrower

(A) as of October 30, 1987 , continued to be actively engaged in the farming operations for which the Secretary had made the farmer program loan; and

(B) as of the deadline for responding to the notice provided for under paragraph (5), requests restructuring of such loans pursuant to section 2001 of this title .

(4) The county committee in the county in which borrower’s land is located shall determine whether the borrower has complied with the requirements of paragraph (3)(A).

(5)

(A) Within 45 days after January 6, 1988 , the Secretary shall provide to the borrowers described in paragraph (3) notice by certified mail of the right of such borrowers to apply for the benefits under such paragraph.

(B) Releases under such paragraph shall be made to qualified borrowers who have responded to the notice within 30 days after receipt.

(C) Within 12 months after a borrower has requested restructuring under section 2001 of this title , the Secretary shall make a final determination on the request. Notwithstanding the 12-month limitation provided for in paragraph (3), releases shall continue to be made to the borrower until a denial or dismissal of the application of the borrower for restructuring under section 2001 of this title is made. The amount of essential household and farm operating expenses which may be released to any borrower eligible for such releases after 12 months may exceed $18,000, by an amount proportionate to the period of time beyond 12 months before a final determination is made by the Secretary.

(6) If a borrower is required to plan for or to report on how proceeds from the sale of collateral property will be used, the Secretary shall

(A) notify the borrower of such requirement; and

(B) notify the borrower of the right to the release of funds under this section and the means by which a request for the funds may be made.

(7) The Secretary shall issue regulations consistent with this section that

(A) ensure the release of funds to each borrower; and

(B) establish guidelines for releases under paragraph (3), including a list of expenditures for which funds will normally be released.
