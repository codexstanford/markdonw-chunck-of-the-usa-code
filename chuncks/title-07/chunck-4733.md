#### § 5405. Agricultural air quality research oversight
##### (a) Findings

Congress finds that

(1) various studies have alleged that agriculture is a source of PM–10 emissions;

(2) many of these studies have often been based on erroneous data;

(3) Federal research activities are currently being conducted by the Department of Agriculture to determine the true extent to which agricultural activities contribute to air pollution and to determine cost-effective ways in which the agricultural industry can reduce any pollution that exists; and

(4) any Federal policy recommendations that may be issued by any Federal agency to address air pollution problems related to agriculture or any other industrial activity should be based on sound scientific findings that are subject to adequate peer review and should take into account economic feasibility.
