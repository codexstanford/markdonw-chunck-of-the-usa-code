(iv) any other information about the biomass conversion facility or proposed biomass conversion facility that the Secretary determines necessary for the Secretary to be reasonably assured that the plant will be in operation by the date on which the eligible crops are ready for harvest.

(B) BCAP project area selection criteria

In selecting BCAP project areas, the Secretary shall consider

(i) the volume of the eligible crops proposed to be produced in the proposed BCAP project area and the probability that those crops will be used for the purposes of the BCAP;
