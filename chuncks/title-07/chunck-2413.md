### CHAPTER 41— FOOD FOR PEACE
#### § 1737. John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer Program
##### (c) Special emphasis on sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries

(1) Findings

Congress finds that

(A) agricultural producers in sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries need training in agricultural techniques that are appropriate for the majority of eligible agricultural producers in those countries, including training in

(i) standard growing practices;

(ii) insecticide and sanitation procedures; and

(iii) other agricultural methods that will produce increased yields of more nutritious and healthful crops;

(B) agricultural producers in the United States (including African-American agricultural producers) and banking and insurance professionals have agribusiness expertise that would be invaluable for agricultural producers in sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries;

(C) a commitment by the United States is appropriate to support the development of a comprehensive agricultural skills training program for those agricultural producers that focuses on

(i) improving knowledge of insecticide and sanitation procedures to prevent crop destruction;

(ii) teaching modern agricultural techniques that would facilitate a continual analysis of crop production, including

(I) the identification and development of standard growing practices; and

(II) the establishment of systems for recordkeeping;

(iii) the use and maintenance of agricultural equipment that is appropriate for the majority of eligible agricultural producers in sub-Saharan African or Caribbean Basin countries;

(iv) the expansion of small agricultural operations into agribusiness enterprises by increasing access to credit for agricultural producers through

(I) the development and use of village banking systems; and

(II) the use of agricultural risk insurance pilot products; and

(v) marketing crop yields to prospective purchasers (including businesses and individuals) for local needs and export; and

(D) programs that promote the exchange of agricultural knowledge and expertise through the exchange of American and foreign agricultural producers have been effective in promoting improved agricultural techniques and food security and the extension of additional resources to such farmer-to-farmer exchanges is warranted.

(2) Goals for programs carried out in sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries

The goals of programs carried out under this section in sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries shall be

(A) to expand small agricultural operations in those countries into agribusiness enterprises by increasing access to credit for agricultural producers through

(i) the development and use of village banking systems; and

(ii) the use of agricultural risk insurance pilot products;

(B) to provide training to agricultural producers in those countries that will

(i) enhance local food security; and

(ii) help mitigate and alleviate hunger;

(C) to provide training to agricultural producers in those countries in groups to encourage participants to share and pass on to other agricultural producers in the home communities of the participants, the information and skills obtained from the training, rather than merely retaining the information and skills for the personal enrichment of the participants; and

(D) to maximize the number of beneficiaries of the programs in sub-Saharan African and Caribbean Basin countries.
