(2) Required action by Secretary

(A) In general

The Secretary shall proportionately reduce base acres on a farm for peanuts for land that has been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses if the size of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is such that the land is unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, unless the producers on the farm demonstrate that the land

(ii) is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use.

(B) Requirement

The Secretary shall establish procedures to identify land described in subparagraph (A).
