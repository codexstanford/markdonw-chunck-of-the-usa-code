#### § 7959. Termination of marketing quota programs for peanuts and compensation to peanut quota holders for loss of quota asset value
##### (f) Eligible peanut quota holder

(1) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary shall consider a person to be an eligible peanut quota holder for the purposes of this section if the person, as of May 13, 2002 , owned a farm that, also as of that date, was eligible for a permanent peanut quota under section 358–1(b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 ( 7 U.S.C. 1358–1(b) ), irrespective of temporary leases, transfers of quotas for seed, or quotas for experimental purposes.

(2) Effect of purchase contract

If there was a written contract for the purchase of all or a portion of a farm described in paragraph (1) as of May 13, 2002 , and the parties to the sale are unable to agree to the disposition of eligibility for payments under this section, the Secretary, taking into account any incomplete permanent transfer of quota that has otherwise been agreed to, shall provide for the equitable division of the payments among the parties by adjusting the determination of who is the eligible peanut quota holder with respect to particular pounds of the quota.

(3) Effect of agreement for permanent quota transfer

If the Secretary determines that there was in existence, as of May 13, 2002 , an agreement for the permanent transfer of quota, but that the transfer was not completed by that date, the Secretary shall consider the peanut quota holder to be the party to the agreement who, as of that date, was the owner of the farm to which the quota was to be transferred.

(4) Protected bases

A person that owns a farm with a peanut poundage quota which is protected under a conservation reserve program contract entered into under section 3831 of title 16 shall be considered to be an eligible quota holder with respect to the protected poundage.

(5) Secretarial discretion

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, the Secretary may declare a person to be the eligible peanut quota holder with respect to certain pounds of quota or otherwise for purposes of this section if the Secretary considers the declaration is needed to insure a fair and equitable administration of the payments provided for in this section, so long as the Secretary does not, in exercising this authority, effectively increase the total quota in excess of the quota that was available to all producers for the 2001 crop year for other than seed or experimental use.

(6) Limitation on quantity of quota held

A person shall be considered an eligible peanut quota holder for purposes of this section only with respect to that number of permanent pounds that qualifies the person as a peanut quota holder under one of the preceding paragraphs. The determination of the peanut poundage amount for which the person qualifies shall be made based on the 2001 crop quota levels and shall take into account sales of the farm that occurred before May 13, 2002 , and any permanent transfers of quota that took place before that date, consistent with the preceding paragraphs. The Secretary shall not take into account, or allow eligibility for, quotas for seed, granted as experimental quotas, or obtained by temporary lease or transfer.
