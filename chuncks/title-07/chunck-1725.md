### CHAPTER 35A— PRICE SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES
#### § 1433b. Processing of surplus agricultural commodities into liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts
##### (a) Authority of Commodity Credit Corporation; terms and conditions established by Secretary; fuel prices

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in order to prevent the accumulation of excessive stocks of agricultural commodities through the price support and stabilization operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation  1 the Corporation may, under terms and conditions established by the Secretary, make its accumulated stocks of agricultural commodities available, at no cost or reduced cost, to encourage the purchase of such commodities for the production of liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts. In carrying out the program established by this section, the Secretary shall ensure, insofar as possible, that any use of agricultural commodities made available be made in such manner as to encourage increased use and avoid displacing usual marketings of agricultural commodities.
