(3) During the period prior to the referendum of an amendment issued pursuant to paragraph (1) and beginning on the effective date of such amendment, the Egg Board shall

(A) establish an escrow account to be used for assessment refunds; and

(B) place funds in such account in accordance with paragraph (4).

(4) The Egg Board shall place in such account, from assessments collected during the period referred to in paragraph (3), an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total amount of assessments collected during such period by 10 percent.

(5) Subject to paragraphs (6), (7), and (8), any producer shall have the right to demand and receive from the Egg Board a one-time refund of assessments collected from such producer during the period referred to in paragraph (3) if

(C) the amendment issued pursuant to paragraph (1) is not approved pursuant to a referendum under section 2708 or 2709(b) of this title.

(7) Such refund shall be made on submission of proof satisfactory to the Egg Board that such producer paid the assessment for which refund is demanded.

(8) If the amount in the escrow account required to be established by paragraph (3) is not sufficient to refund the total amount of assessments demanded by all eligible producers under this subsection and the amendment issued pursuant to paragraph (1) is not approved pursuant to a referendum under section 2708 or 2709(b) of this title, the Egg Board shall prorate the amount of such refunds among all eligible producers who demand such refund.
