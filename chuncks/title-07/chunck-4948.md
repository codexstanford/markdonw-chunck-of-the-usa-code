(5) Agricultural development in the American-Pacific region

Research and extension grants may be made under this section to support food and agricultural science at a consortium of land-grant institutions in the American-Pacific region.

(6) Tropical and subtropical agricultural research

Research grants may be made under this section, in equal dollar amounts to the Caribbean and Pacific Basins, to support tropical and subtropical agricultural research, including pest and disease research, at the land-grant institutions in the Caribbean and Pacific regions.

(7) Women and minorities in stem fields

Research and extension grants may be made under this section to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with priority given to eligible institutions that carry out continuing programs funded by the Secretary.

(8) Alfalfa seed and alfalfa forage systems research program

Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purpose of studying improvements in alfalfa seed and alfalfa forage systems yields, biomass and persistence, pest pressures, the bioenergy potential of alfalfa seed and other alfalfa forage systems to reduce losses during harvest and storage.

(9) Coffee plant health initiative

Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purposes of

(A) developing and disseminating science-based tools and treatments to combat the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei); and

(B) establishing an areawide integrated pest management program in areas affected by, or areas at risk of, being affected by the coffee berry borer.

(10) Corn, soybean meal, cereal grains, and grain byproducts research and extension

Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purpose of carrying out or enhancing research to improve the digestibility, nutritional value, and efficiency of the use of corn, soybean meal, cereal grains, and grain byproducts for the poultry and food animal production industries.

(11) Macadamia tree health initiative

Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purposes of

(A) developing and disseminating science-based tools and treatments to combat the macadamia felted coccid ( Eriococcus ironsidei ); and

(B) establishing an areawide integrated pest management program in areas affected by, or areas at risk of being affected by, the macadamia felted coccid.

(12) National turfgrass research initiative

Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purposes of

(A) carrying out or enhancing research related to turfgrass and sod issues;

(B) enhancing production and uses of turfgrass for the general public;

(C) identifying new turfgrass varieties with superior drought, heat, cold, and pest tolerance to reduce water, fertilizer, and pesticide use;

(D) selecting genetically superior turfgrasses and developing improved technologies for managing commercial, residential, and recreational turfgrass areas;

(E) producing turfgrasses that

(i) aid in mitigating soil erosion;

(ii) protect against pollutant runoff into waterways; or

(iii) provide other environmental benefits;

(F) investigating, preserving, and protecting native plant species, including grasses not currently utilized in turfgrass systems;

(G) creating systems for more economical and viable turfgrass seed and sod production throughout the United States; and

(H) investigating the turfgrass phytobiome and developing biologic products to enhance soil, enrich plants, and mitigate pests.

(13) Fertilizer management initiative

(A) In general

Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purpose of carrying out research to improve fertilizer use efficiency in crops

(i) to maximize crop yield; and

(ii) to minimize nutrient losses to surface and groundwater and the atmosphere.

(B) Priority

In awarding grants under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall give priority to research examining the impact of the source, rate, timing, and placement of plant nutrients.

(14) Cattle fever tick program

Research and extension grants may be made under this section to study cattle fever ticks

(A) to facilitate the understanding of the role of wildlife in the persistence and spread of cattle fever ticks;

(B) to develop advanced methods for eradication of cattle fever ticks, including

(i) alternative treatment methods for cattle and other susceptible species;

(ii) field treatment for premises, including corral pens and pasture loafing areas;

(iii) methods for treatment and control on infested wildlife;

(iv) biological control agents; and

(v) new and improved vaccines;

(C) to evaluate rangeland vegetation that impacts the survival of cattle fever ticks;

(D) to improve management of diseases relating to cattle fever ticks that are associated with wildlife, livestock, and human health;

(E) to improve diagnostic detection of tick-infested or infected animals and pastures; and

(F) to conduct outreach to impacted ranchers, hunters, and landowners to integrate tactics and document sustainability of best practices.

(15) Laying hen and turkey research program

Research grants may be made under this section for the purpose of improving the efficiency and sustainability of laying hen and turkey production through integrated, collaborative research and technology transfer. Emphasis may be placed on laying hen and turkey disease prevention, antimicrobial resistance, nutrition, gut health, and alternative housing systems under extreme seasonal weather conditions.
