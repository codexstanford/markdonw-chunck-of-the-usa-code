#### § 1522. Research and development
##### (c) Research and development authority

(1) Authority

The Corporation may conduct activities or enter into contracts to carry out research and development to maintain or improve existing policies or develop new policies to

(A) increase participation in States in which the Corporation determines that

(i) there is traditionally, and continues to be, a low level of Federal crop insurance participation and availability; and

(ii) the State is underserved by the Federal crop insurance program;

(B) increase participation in areas that are underserved by the Federal crop insurance program; and

(C) increase participation by producers of underserved agricultural commodities, including specialty crops.

(2) Underserved agricultural commodities and areas

(A) Authority

The Corporation may conduct research and development or enter into contracts under procedures prescribed by the Corporation with qualified persons to carry out research and development for policies that promote the purposes of paragraph (1).

(B) Consultation

Before conducting research and development or entering into a contract under subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall consult with groups representing producers of agricultural commodities that would be served by the policies that are the subject of the research and development.

(3) Qualified persons

A person with experience in crop insurance or farm or ranch risk management (including a college or university, an approved insurance provider, and a trade or research organization), as determined by the Corporation, shall be eligible to enter into a contract with the Corporation under this subsection.

(4) Types of contracts

A contract under this subsection may provide for research and development regarding new or expanded policies, including policies based on adjusted gross income, cost-of-production, quality losses, and an intermediate base program with a higher coverage and cost than catastrophic risk protection.

(5) Use of resulting policies

The Corporation may offer any policy developed under this subsection that is approved by the Board after expert review in accordance with section 1505(e) of this title .

(6) Research and development priorities

The Corporation shall establish as one of the highest research and development priorities of the Corporation the development of policies that increase participation by producers of underserved agricultural commodities, including sweet sorghum, biomass sorghum, rice, peanuts, sugarcane, alfalfa, pennycress, dedicated energy crops, and specialty crops.

(7) Whole farm diversified risk management insurance plan

(A) In general

Unless the Corporation approves a whole farm insurance plan, similar to the plan described in this paragraph, to be available to producers for the 2016 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall conduct activities or enter into contracts to carry out research and development to develop a whole farm risk management insurance plan, with a liability limitation of $1,500,000, that allows a diversified crop or livestock producer the option to qualify for an indemnity if actual gross farm revenue is below 85 percent of the average gross farm revenue or the expected gross farm revenue that can reasonably be expected of the producer, as determined by the Corporation.

(B) Eligible producers

The Corporation shall permit producers (including direct-to-consumer marketers and producers servicing local and regional and farm identity-preserved markets) who produce multiple agricultural commodities, including specialty crops, industrial crops, livestock, and aquaculture products, to participate in the plan developed under subparagraph (A) in lieu of any other plan under this subchapter.

(C) Diversification

The Corporation may provide diversification-based additional coverage payment rates, premium discounts, or other enhanced benefits in recognition of the risk management benefits of crop and livestock diversification strategies for producers that

(i) grow multiple crops; or

(ii) may have income from the production of livestock that uses a crop grown on the farm.

(D) Market readiness

The Corporation may include coverage for the value of any packing, packaging, or any other similar on-farm activity the Corporation determines to be the minimum required in order to remove the commodity from the field.

(VI) treating the different growth stages of aquaculture species as separate crops to recognize the difference in perils at different phases of growth;

(VII) moderating the impacts of disaster years on historic revenue, such as

(aa) using an average of the historic and projected revenue;

(bb) counting indemnities as historic revenue for loss years;

(cc) counting payments under section 7333 of this title as historic revenue for loss years; or
