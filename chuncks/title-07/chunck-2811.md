##### (b) Eligibility

To be eligible to obtain assistance under subsection (a)

(1) the delinquency must be due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower, as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary, except that the regulations shall require that, if the value of the assets calculated under subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) that may be realized through liquidation or other methods would produce enough income to make the delinquent loan current, the borrower shall not be eligible for assistance under subsection (a);

(2) the borrower must have acted in good faith with the Secretary in connection with the loan as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary;

(3) the borrower must present a preliminary plan to the Secretary that contains reasonable assumptions that demonstrate that the borrower will be able to

(A) meet the necessary family living and farm operating expenses; and

(B) service all debts, including those of the loans restructured; and

(4) the loan, if restructured, must result in a net recovery to the Federal Government, during the term of the loan as restructured, that would be more than or equal to the net recovery to the Federal Government from an involuntary liquidation or foreclosure on the property securing the loan.
