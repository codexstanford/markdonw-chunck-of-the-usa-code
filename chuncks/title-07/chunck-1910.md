### CHAPTER 36— CROP INSURANCE
#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (i) Adoption of rates and coverages

(1) In general

The Corporation shall adopt, as soon as practicable, rates and coverages that will improve the actuarial soundness of the insurance operations of the Corporation for those crops that are determined to be insured at rates that are not actuarially sound, except that no rate may be increased by an amount of more than 20 percent over the comparable rate of the preceding crop year.

(2) Review of rating methodologies

To maximize participation in the Federal crop insurance program and to ensure equity for producers, the Corporation shall periodically review the methodologies employed for rating plans of insurance under this subchapter consistent with section 1507(c)(2) of this title .

(3) Analysis of rating and loss history

The Corporation shall analyze the rating and loss history of approved policies and plans of insurance for agricultural commodities by area.

(4) Premium adjustment

If the Corporation makes a determination that premium rates are excessive for an agricultural commodity in an area relative to the requirements of subsection (d)(2) for that area, then, for the 2002 crop year (and as necessary thereafter), the Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments in the premium rates for that area for that agricultural commodity.
