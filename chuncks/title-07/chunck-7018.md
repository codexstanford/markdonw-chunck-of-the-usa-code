(1) Rice

The prevailing world market price for long grain rice and medium grain rice determined under subsection (d) shall be adjusted to United States quality and location.

(2) Cotton

The prevailing world market price for upland cotton determined under subsection (d)

(A) shall be adjusted to United States quality and location, with the adjustment to include

(i) a reduction equal to any United States Premium Factor for upland cotton of a quality higher than Middling (M) 1 3 ⁄ 32 -inch; and

(ii) the average costs to market the commodity, including average transportation costs, as determined by the Secretary; and

(B) may be further adjusted, during the period beginning on February 7, 2014 , and ending on July 31, 2024 , if the Secretary determines the adjustment is necessary

(i) to minimize potential loan forfeitures;

(ii) to minimize the accumulation of stocks of upland cotton by the Federal Government;

(iii) to ensure that upland cotton produced in the United States can be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally; and

(iv) to ensure an appropriate transition between current-crop and forward-crop price quotations, except that the Secretary may use forward-crop price quotations prior to July 31 of a marketing year only if

(I) there are insufficient current-crop price quotations; and

(II) the forward-crop price quotation is the lowest such quotation available.

(3) Guidelines for additional adjustments

In making adjustments under this subsection, the Secretary shall establish a mechanism for determining and announcing the adjustments in order to avoid undue disruption in the United States market.
