#### § 1508a. Double insurance and prevented planting
##### (b) Double insurance

(1) Options on loss to first crop

Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e), if a first crop insured under this subchapter in a crop year has a total or partial insurable loss, the producer of the first crop may elect one of the following options:

(A) No second crop planted

The producer may

(i) elect to not plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

(ii) collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop.

(B) Second crop planted

The producer may

(i) plant a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year; and

(ii) collect an indemnity payment established by the Corporation for the first crop, but not to exceed 35 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop.

(2) Effect of no loss to second crop

If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B) and the producer does not suffer an insurable loss to the second crop, the producer may collect an indemnity payment for the first crop that is equal to

(A) 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop; less

(B) the amount previously collected under paragraph (1)(B)(ii).

(3) Premium for first crop if second crop planted

(A) Initial premium

If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B), the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop that is commensurate with the indemnity paid under paragraph (1)(B)(ii). The Corporation shall adjust the total premium for the first crop to reflect the reduced indemnity.

(B) Effect of no loss to second crop

If the producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B) and the producer does not suffer an insurable loss to the second crop, the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop that is equal to

(i) the full premium owed by the producer for the first crop; less

(ii) the amount of premium previously paid under subparagraph (A).
