### CHAPTER 36— CROP INSURANCE
#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (k) Reinsurance

(1) In general

Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, provide reinsurance to insurers approved by the Corporation that insure producers of any agricultural commodity under 1 or more plans acceptable to the Corporation.

(2) Terms and conditions

The reinsurance shall be provided on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine to be consistent with subsections (b) and (c) and sound reinsurance principles.

(3) Share of risk

The reinsurance agreements of the Corporation with the reinsured companies shall require the reinsured companies to bear a sufficient share of any potential loss under the agreement so as to ensure that the reinsured company will sell and service policies of insurance in a sound and prudent manner, taking into consideration the financial condition of the reinsured companies and the availability of private reinsurance.

(4) Rate

(A) In general

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the rate established by the Board to reimburse approved insurance providers and agents for the administrative and operating costs of the providers and agents shall not exceed

(i) for the 1998 reinsurance year, 27 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio; and

(ii) for each of the 1999 and subsequent reinsurance years, 24.5 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio.

(B) Proportional reductions

A policy of additional coverage that received a rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs for the 1998 reinsurance year that is lower than the rate specified in subparagraph (A)(i) shall receive a reduction in the rate of reimbursement that is proportional to the reduction in the rate of reimbursement between clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).

(C) Other reductions

Beginning with the 2002 reinsurance year, in the case of a policy or plan of insurance approved by the Board that was not reinsured during the 1998 reinsurance year but, had it been reinsured, would have received a reduced rate of reimbursement during the 1998 reinsurance year, the rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs established for the policy or plan of insurance shall take into account the factors used to determine the rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs during the 1998 reinsurance year, including the expected difference in premium and actual administrative and operating costs of the policy or plan of insurance relative to an individual yield policy or plan of insurance and other appropriate factors, as determined by the Corporation.

(D) Time for reimbursement

Effective beginning with the 2012 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall reimburse approved insurance providers and agents for the allowable administrative and operating costs of the providers and agents as soon as practicable after October 1 (but not later than October 31) after the reinsurance year for which reimbursements are earned.

(E) Reimbursement rate reduction

In the case of a policy of additional coverage that received a rate of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs for the 2008 reinsurance year, for each of the 2009 and subsequent reinsurance years, the reimbursement rate for administrative and operating costs shall be 2.3 percentage points below the rates in effect as of the date of enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 for all crop insurance policies used to define loss ratio, except that only ½ of the reduction shall apply in a reinsurance year to the total premium written in a State in which the State loss ratio is greater than 1.2.

(F) Reimbursement rate for area policies and plans of insurance

Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) through (E), for each of the 2009 and subsequent reinsurance years, the reimbursement rate for area policies and plans of insurance widely available as of the date of enactment of this subparagraph or authorized under subsection (c)(4)(C) or section 1508b of this title shall be 12 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio for that reinsurance year.

(5) Cost and regulatory reduction

Consistent with section 118 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, and consistent with maintenance of program integrity, prevention of fraud and abuse, the need for program expansion, and improvement of quality of service to customers, the Board shall alter program procedures and administrative requirements in order to reduce the administrative and operating costs of approved insurance providers and agents in an amount that corresponds to any reduction in the reimbursement rate required under paragraph (4) during the 5-year period beginning on October 13, 1994 .

(6) Agency discretion

The determination of whether the Corporation is achieving, or has achieved, corresponding administrative cost savings shall not be subject to administrative review, and is wholly committed to agency discretion within the meaning of section 701(a)(2) of title 5 .

(7) Plan

The Corporation shall submit to Congress a plan outlining the measures that will be used to achieve the reduction required under paragraph (5). If the Corporation can identify additional cost reduction measures, the Corporation shall describe the measures in the plan.

(8) Renegotiation of standard reinsurance agreement

(A) In general

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), notwithstanding section 536 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 ( 7 U.S.C. 1506 note; Public Law 105–185 ) and section 148 of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 ( 7 U.S.C. 1506 note; Public Law 106–224 ), the Corporation may renegotiate the financial terms and conditions of each Standard Reinsurance Agreement

(i) to be effective for the 2011 reinsurance year beginning July 1, 2010 ; and

(ii) once during each period of 5 reinsurance years thereafter.

(B) Exceptions

(i) Adverse circumstances

Subject to clause (ii), subparagraph (A) shall not apply in any case in which the approved insurance providers, as a whole, experience unexpected adverse circumstances, as determined by the Secretary.

(ii) Effect of Federal law changes

If Federal law is enacted after the date of enactment of this paragraph that requires revisions in the financial terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement, and changes in the Agreement are made on a mandatory basis by the Corporation, the changes shall not be considered to be a renegotiation of the Agreement for purposes of subparagraph (A).

(C) Notification requirement

If the Corporation renegotiates a Standard Reinsurance Agreement under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Corporation shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate of the renegotiation.

(D) Consultation

The approved insurance providers may confer with each other and collectively with the Corporation during any renegotiation under subparagraph (A).

(E) 2011 reinsurance year

(i) In general

As part of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement renegotiation authorized under subparagraph (A)(i), the Corporation shall consider alternative methods to determine reimbursement rates for administrative and operating costs.

(ii) Alternative methods

Alternatives considered under clause (i) shall include

(I) methods that

(aa) are graduated and base reimbursement rates in a State on changes in premiums in that State;

(bb) are graduated and base reimbursement rates in a State on the loss ratio for crop insurance for that State; and

(cc) are graduated and base reimbursement rates on individual policies on the level of total premium for each policy; and

(II) any other method that takes into account current financial conditions of the program and ensures continued availability of the program to producers on a nationwide basis.

(F) Budget

(i) In general

The Board shall ensure that any Standard Reinsurance Agreement negotiated under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall

(I) to the maximum extent practicable, be estimated as budget neutral with respect to the total amount of payments described in paragraph (9) as compared to the total amount of such payments estimated to be made under the immediately preceding Standard Reinsurance Agreement if that Agreement were extended over the same period of time;

(II) comply with the applicable provisions of this subchapter establishing the rates of reimbursement for administrative and operating costs for approved insurance providers and agents, except that, to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated total amount of reimbursement for those costs shall not be less than the total amount of the payments to be made under the immediately preceding Standard Reinsurance Agreement if that Agreement were extended over the same period of time, as estimated on February 7, 2014 ; and

(III) in no event significantly depart from budget neutrality unless otherwise required by this subchapter.

(ii) Use of savings

To the extent that any budget savings are realized in the renegotiation of a Standard Reinsurance Agreement under subparagraph (A)(ii), and the savings are determined not to be a significant departure from budget neutrality under clause (i), the savings shall be used to increase reimbursements or payments described under paragraphs (4) and (9).

(9) Due date for payment of underwriting gains

Effective beginning with the 2011 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall make payments for underwriting gains under this subchapter on

(A) for the 2011 reinsurance year, October 1, 2012 ; and
