##### (b) Regulations

(1) In general

A food may bear a disclosure that the food is bioengineered only in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with this subchapter.

(2) Requirements

A regulation promulgated by the Secretary in carrying out this subchapter shall

(A) prohibit a food derived from an animal to be considered a bioengineered food solely because the animal consumed feed produced from, containing, or consisting of a bioengineered substance;

(B) determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may be present in food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be a bioengineered food;

(C) establish a process for requesting and granting a determination by the Secretary regarding other factors and conditions under which a food is considered a bioengineered food;

(D) in accordance with subsection (d), require that the form of a food disclosure under this section be a text, symbol, or electronic or digital link, but excluding Internet website Uniform Resource Locators not embedded in the link, with the disclosure option to be selected by the food manufacturer;

(E) provide alternative reasonable disclosure options for food contained in small or very small packages;

(F) in the case of small food manufacturers, provide

(i) an implementation date that is not earlier than 1 year after the implementation date for regulations promulgated in accordance with this section; and

(ii) on-package disclosure options, in addition to those available under subparagraph (D), to be selected by the small food manufacturer, that consist of

(I) a telephone number accompanied by appropriate language to indicate that the phone number provides access to additional information; and

(II) an Internet website maintained by the small food manufacturer in a manner consistent with subsection (d), as appropriate; and

(G) exclude

(3) Safety

For the purpose of regulations promulgated and food disclosures made pursuant to paragraph (2), a bioengineered food that has successfully completed the pre-market Federal regulatory review process shall not be treated as safer than, or not as safe as, a non-bioengineered counterpart of the food solely because the food is bioengineered or produced or developed with the use of bioengineering.
