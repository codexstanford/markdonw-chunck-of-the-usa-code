#### § 6711. Carbon cycle research
##### (c) Use

Land grant universities described in subsection (b) shall use funds made available under this section

(1) to conduct research to improve the scientific basis of using land management practices to increase soil carbon sequestration, including research on the use of new technologies to increase carbon cycle effectiveness, such as biotechnology and nanotechnology;

(2) to enter into partnerships to identify, develop, and evaluate agricultural best practices, including partnerships between

(A) Federal, State, or private entities; and

(B) the Department of Agriculture;

(3) to develop necessary computer models to predict and assess the carbon cycle;

(4) to estimate and develop mechanisms to measure carbon levels made available as a result of

(A) voluntary Federal conservation programs;

(B) private and Federal forests; and

(C) other land uses;

(5) to develop outreach programs, in coordination with Extension Services, to share information on carbon cycle and agricultural best practices that is useful to agricultural producers; and

(6) to collaborate with the Great Plains Regional Earth Science Application Center to develop a space-based carbon cycle remote sensing technology program to

(A) provide, on a near-continual basis, a real-time and comprehensive view of vegetation conditions;

(B) assess and model agricultural carbon sequestration; and

(C) develop commercial products.
