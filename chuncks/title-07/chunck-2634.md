(1) The Secretary may participate in joint financing to facilitate development of private business enterprises in rural areas with the Economic Development Administration, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal and State agencies and with private and quasi-public financial institutions, through joint loans to applicants eligible under subsection (a) for the purpose of improving, developing, or financing business, industry, and employment and improving the economic and environmental climate in rural areas or through joint grants to applicants eligible under subsection (c) for such purposes, including in the case of loans or grants the development, construction, or acquisition of land, buildings, plants, equipment, access streets and roads, parking areas, utility extensions, necessary water supply and waste disposal facilities, refining, service and fees.

(2) No financial or other assistance shall be extended under any provision of this section, except for cases in which such assistance does not exceed $1,000,000 or for cases in which direct employment will not be increased by more than fifty employees, that is calculated to or is likely to result in the transfer from one area to another of any employment or business activity provided by operations of the applicant, but this limitation shall not be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the establishment of such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment in the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations unless there is reason to believe that such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations.

(3) No financial or other assistance shall be extended under any provision of this section, except for cases in which such assistance does not exceed $1,000,000 or for cases in which direct employment will not be increased by more than fifty employees, which is calculated to or likely to result in an increase in the production of goods, materials, or commodities, or the availability of services or facilities in the area, when there is not sufficient demand for such goods, materials, commodities, services, or facilities, to employ the efficient capacity of existing competitive commercial or industrial enterprises, unless such financial or other assistance will not have an adverse effect upon existing competitive enterprises in the area.

(4) No financial or other assistance shall be extended under any provision of this section, except for cases in which such assistance does not exceed $1,000,000 or for cases in which direct employment will not be increased by more than fifty employees, if the Secretary of Labor certifies within 30 days after the matter has been submitted to him by the Secretary of Agriculture that the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection have not been complied with. The Secretary of Labor shall, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, develop a system of certification which will insure the expeditious processing of requests for assistance under this section.

(5) No grant or loan authorized to be made under this chapter shall require or be subject to the prior approval of any officer, employee, or agency of any State.

(6) No loan commitment issued under this section shall be conditioned upon the applicant investing in excess of 10 per centum in the business or industrial enterprise for which purpose the loan is to be made unless the Secretary determines there are special circumstances which necessitate an equity investment by the applicant greater than 10 per centum.

(7) No provision of law shall prohibit issuance by the Secretary of certificates evidencing beneficial ownership in a block of notes insured or guaranteed under this chapter or Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [ 42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.]; any sale by the Secretary of such certificates shall be treated as a sale of assets for the purposes of chapter 11 of title 31. Any security representing beneficial ownership in a block of notes guaranteed or insured under this chapter or Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 issued by a private entity shall be exempt from laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, except sections 77q, 77v, and 77x of title 15; however, the Secretary shall require (i) that the issuer place such notes in the custody of an institution chartered by a Federal or State agency to act as trustee and (ii) that the issuer provide such periodic reports of sales as the Secretary deems necessary.
