(1) In general

(A) Applicability

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), at the option of the State agency, allotments for residents of any facility described in subparagraph (B), (C), (D), or (E) of section 2012(m)(5) of this title (referred to in this subsection as a “covered facility”) may be determined and issued under this paragraph in lieu of subsection (a).

(ii) Limitation

Unless the Secretary authorizes implementation of this paragraph in all States under paragraph (3), clause (i) shall apply only to residents of covered facilities participating in a pilot project under paragraph (2).

(B) Amount of allotment

The allotment for each eligible resident described in subparagraph (A) shall be calculated in accordance with standardized procedures established by the Secretary that take into account the allotments typically received by residents of covered facilities.

(C) Issuance of allotment

(i) In general

The State agency shall issue an allotment determined under this paragraph to a covered facility as the authorized representative of the residents of the covered facility.

(ii) Adjustment

The Secretary shall establish procedures to ensure that a covered facility does not receive a greater proportion of a resident’s monthly allotment than the proportion of the month during which the resident lived in the covered facility.

(D) Departures of residents of covered facilities

(i) Notification

Any covered facility that receives an allotment for a resident under this paragraph shall

(I) notify the State agency promptly on the departure of the resident; and

(II) notify the resident, before the departure of the resident, that the resident

(aa) is eligible for continued benefits under the supplemental nutrition assistance program; and

(bb) should contact the State agency concerning continuation of the benefits.

(ii) Issuance to departed residents

On receiving a notification under clause (i)(I) concerning the departure of a resident, the State agency

(I) shall promptly issue the departed resident an allotment for the days of the month after the departure of the resident (calculated in a manner prescribed by the Secretary) unless the departed resident reapplies to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program; and

(II) may issue an allotment for the month following the month of the departure (but not any subsequent month) based on this paragraph unless the departed resident reapplies to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program.

(iii) State option

The State agency may elect not to issue an allotment under clause (ii)(I) if the State agency lacks sufficient information on the location of the departed resident to provide the allotment.

(iv) Effect of reapplication

If the departed resident reapplies to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, the allotment of the departed resident shall be determined without regard to this paragraph.

(2) Pilot projects

(A) In general

Before the Secretary authorizes implementation of paragraph (1) in all States, the Secretary shall carry out, at the request of 1 or more State agencies and in 1 or more areas of the United States, such number of pilot projects as the Secretary determines to be sufficient to test the feasibility of determining and issuing allotments to residents of covered facilities under paragraph (1) in lieu of subsection (a).

(B) Project plan

To be eligible to participate in a pilot project under subparagraph (A), a State agency shall submit to the Secretary for approval a project plan that includes

(i) a specification of the covered facilities in the State that will participate in the pilot project;

(ii) a schedule for reports to be submitted to the Secretary on the pilot project;

(iii) procedures for standardizing allotment amounts that takes into account the allotments typically received by residents of covered facilities; and

(iv) a commitment to carry out the pilot project in compliance with the requirements of this subsection other than paragraph (1)(B).

(3) Authorization of implementation in all States

(A) In general

The Secretary shall

(i) determine whether to authorize implementation of paragraph (1) in all States; and

(ii) notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate of the determination.

(B) Determination not to authorize implementation in all States

(i) In general

If the Secretary makes a finding described in clause (ii), the Secretary

(I) shall not authorize implementation of paragraph (1) in all States; and

(II) shall terminate all pilot projects under paragraph (2) within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the Secretary).

(ii) Finding

The finding referred to in clause (i) is that

(I) an insufficient number of project plans that the Secretary determines to be eligible for approval are submitted by State agencies under paragraph (2)(B); or

(II)

(aa) a sufficient number of pilot projects have been carried out under paragraph (2)(A); and

(bb) authorization of implementation of paragraph (1) in all States is not in the best interest of the supplemental nutrition assistance program.
