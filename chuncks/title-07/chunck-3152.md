#### § 2016. Issuance and use of program benefits
##### (h) Electronic benefit transfers

(1) In general.

(A) Implementation .

Not later than October 1, 2002 , each State agency shall implement an electronic benefit transfer system under which household benefits determined under section 2017(a) or 2035 of this title are issued from and stored in a central databank, unless the Secretary provides a waiver for a State agency that faces unusual barriers to implementing an electronic benefit transfer system.

(B) Timely implementation .

Each State agency is encouraged to implement an electronic benefit transfer system under subparagraph (A) as soon as practicable.

(C) State flexibility .

Subject to paragraph (2), a State agency may procure and implement an electronic benefit transfer system under the terms, conditions, and design that the State agency considers appropriate.

(D) Operation .

An electronic benefit transfer system should take into account generally accepted standard operating rules based on

(i) commercial electronic funds transfer technology;

(ii) the need to permit interstate operation and law enforcement monitoring; and

(iii) the need to permit monitoring and investigations by authorized law enforcement agencies.

(2) The Secretary shall issue final regulations that establish standards for the approval of such a system and shall periodically review such regulations and modify such regulations to take into account evolving technology and comparable industry standards. The standards shall include

(A) defining the required level of recipient protection regarding privacy, ease of use, and access to and service in retail food stores;

(B) the terms and conditions of participation by retail food stores, financial institutions, and other appropriate parties;

(C)

(i) measures to maximize the security of a system using the most recent technology available that the State agency considers appropriate and cost effective and which may include personal identification numbers, photographic identification on electronic benefit transfer cards, and other measures to protect against fraud and abuse; and

(ii) unless determined by the Secretary to be located in an area with significantly limited access to food, measures that require an electronic benefit transfer system

(I) to set and enforce sales restrictions based on benefit transfer payment eligibility by using scanning or product lookup entry; and

(II) to deny benefit tenders for manually entered sales of ineligible items.

(D) system transaction interchange, reliability, and processing speeds;

(E) financial accountability;

(F) the required testing of system operations prior to implementation;

(G) the analysis of the results of system implementation in a limited project area prior to expansion; and

(H) procurement standards.

(3) In the case of a system described in paragraph (1) in which participation is not optional for households, the Secretary shall not approve such a system unless

(A) a sufficient number of eligible retail food stores, including those stores able to serve minority language populations, have agreed to participate in the system throughout the area in which it will operate to ensure that eligible households will not suffer a significant reduction in their choice of retail food stores or a significant increase in the cost of food or transportation to participating food stores; and

(B) any special equipment necessary to allow households to purchase food with the benefits issued under this chapter is operational at a sufficient number of registers to provide service that is comparable to service provided individuals who are not members of households receiving supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, as determined by the Secretary.

(4) Administrative costs incurred in connection with activities under this subsection shall be eligible for reimbursement in accordance with section 2025 of this title , subject to the limitations in section 2025(g) of this title .

(5) The Secretary shall periodically inform State agencies of the advantages of using electronic benefit systems to issue benefits in accordance with this subsection in lieu of issuing coupons to households.

(6) This subsection shall not diminish the authority of the Secretary to conduct projects to test automated or electronic benefit delivery systems under section 2026(f) of this title .

(7) Replacement of benefits .

Regulations issued by the Secretary regarding the replacement of benefits and liability for replacement of benefits under an electronic benefit transfer system shall be similar to the regulations in effect for a paper-based supplemental nutrition assistance issuance system.

(8) Replacement of cards .

(A) Fees .

A State agency may collect a charge for replacement of an electronic benefit transfer card by reducing the monthly allotment of the household receiving the replacement card.

(B) Purposeful loss of cards.

(i) In general .

Subject to terms and conditions established by the Secretary in accordance with clause (ii), if a household makes excessive requests for replacement of the electronic benefit transfer card of the household, the Secretary may require a State agency to decline to issue a replacement card to the household unless the household, upon request of the State agency, provides an explanation for the loss of the card.

(ii) Requirements .

The terms and conditions established by the Secretary shall provide that

(I) the household be given the opportunity to provide the requested explanation and meet the requirements under this paragraph promptly;

(II) after an excessive number of lost cards, the head of the household shall be required to review program rights and responsibilities with State agency personnel authorized to make determinations under section 2014(a) of this title ; and

(III) any action taken, including actions required under section 2015(b)(2) of this title , other than the withholding of the electronic benefit transfer card until an explanation described in subclause (I) is provided, shall be consistent with the due process protections under section 2015(b) or 2020(e)(10) of this title, as appropriate.

(C) Protecting vulnerable persons .

In implementing this paragraph, a State agency shall act to protect homeless persons, persons with disabilities, victims of crimes, and other vulnerable persons who lose electronic benefit transfer cards but are not intentionally committing fraud.

(D) Effect on eligibility .

While a State may decline to issue an electronic benefits transfer card until a household satisfies the requirements under this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph shall be considered a denial of, or limitation on, the eligibility for benefits under section 2014 of this title .

(9) Optional photographic identification.

(A) In general .

A State agency may require that an electronic benefit card contain a photograph of 1 or more members of a household.

(B) Other authorized users .

If a State agency requires a photograph on an electronic benefit card under subparagraph (A), the State agency shall establish procedures to ensure that any other appropriate member of the household or any authorized representative of the household may utilize the card.
