### CHAPTER 102— EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE
#### § 7502. Availability of CCC commodities
##### (h) Kosher and Halal food

As soon as practicable after February 7, 2014 , the Secretary shall finalize and implement a plan

(1) to increase the purchase of Kosher and Halal food from food manufacturers with a Kosher or Halal certification to carry out the program established under this chapter if the Kosher and Halal food purchased is cost neutral as compared to food that is not from food manufacturers with a Kosher or Halal certification; and

(2) to modify the labeling of the commodities list used to carry out the program in a manner that enables Kosher and Halal distribution entities to identify which commodities to obtain from local food banks.
