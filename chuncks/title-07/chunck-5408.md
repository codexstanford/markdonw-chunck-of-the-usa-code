#### § 6711. Carbon cycle research
##### (d) Cooperative research

(1) In general

Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary, in cooperation with departments and agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program (which may use any of their statutory authorities) and with eligible entities, may carry out research to promote understanding of

(A) the flux of carbon in soils and plants (including trees); and

(B) the exchange of other greenhouse gases from agriculture.

(2) Eligible entities

Research under this subsection may be carried out through the competitive awarding of grants and cooperative agreements to colleges and universities (as defined in section 3103 of this title ).

(3) Cooperative research purposes

Research conducted under this subsection shall encourage collaboration among scientists with expertise in the areas of soil science, agronomy, agricultural economics, forestry, and other agricultural sciences to focus on

(A) developing data addressing carbon losses and gains in soils and plants (including trees) and the exchange of methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture;

(B) understanding how agricultural and forestry practices affect the sequestration of carbon in soils and plants (including trees) and the exchange of other greenhouse gases, including the effects of new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology;

(C) developing cost-effective means of measuring and monitoring changes in carbon pools in soils and plants (including trees), including computer models;

(D) evaluating the linkage between federal conservation programs and carbon sequestration;

(E) developing methods, including remote sensing, to measure the exchange of carbon and other greenhouse gases sequestered, and to evaluate leakage, performance, and permanence issues; and

(F) assessing the applicability of the results of research conducted under this subsection for developing methods to account for the impact of agricultural activities (including forestry) on the exchange of greenhouse gases.

(4) Authorization of appropriation

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this subsection for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2007.
