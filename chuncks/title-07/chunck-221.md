#### § 21. Registered futures associations
##### (o) Delegation to futures associations of registrative functions; discretionary review by Commission; judicial appeal

(1) The Commission may require any futures association registered pursuant to this section to perform any portion of the registration functions under this chapter with respect to each member of the association other than a registered entity and with respect to each associated person of such member, in accordance with rules, notwithstanding any other provision of law, adopted by such futures association and submitted to the Commission pursuant to subsection (j), and subject to the provisions of this chapter applicable to registrations granted by the Commission.

(2) In performing any Commission registration function authorized by the Commission under section 12a(10) of this title , this section, or any other applicable provisions of this chapter, a futures association may issue orders (A) to refuse to register any person, (B) to register conditionally any person, (C) to suspend the registration of any person, (D) to place restrictions on the registration of any person, or (E) to revoke the registration of any person. If such an order is the final decision of the futures association, any person against whom the order has been issued may petition the Commission to review the decision. The Commission may on its own initiative or upon petition decline review or grant review and affirm, set aside, or modify such an order of the futures association; and the findings of the futures association as to the facts, if supported by the weight of the evidence, shall be conclusive. Unless the Commission grants review under this section of an order concerning registration issued by a futures association, the order of the futures association shall be considered to be an order issued by the Commission.

(3) Nothing in this section shall affect the Commission’s authority to review the granting of a registration application by a registered futures association that is performing any Commission registration function authorized by the Commission under section 12a(10) of this title , this section, or any other applicable provision of this chapter.

(4) If a person against whom a futures association has issued a registration order under this subsection petitions the Commission to review that order and the Commission declines to take review, such person may file a petition for review with a United States court of appeals, in accordance with section 9 of this title .
