#### § 136a–1. Reregistration of registered pesticides
##### (k) Reregistration and expedited processing fund

(1) Establishment

There shall be established in the Treasury of the United States a reregistration and expedited processing fund which shall be known as the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund.

(2) Source and use

(A) All moneys derived from fees collected by the Administrator under subsection (i) shall be deposited in the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund and shall be available to the Administrator, without fiscal year limitation, specifically to offset the costs of reregistration and expedited processing of the applications specified in paragraph (3), to offset the costs of registration review under section 136a(g) of this title , including the costs associated with any review under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) required as part of the registration review, to offset the costs associated with tracking and implementing registration review decisions, including registration review decisions designed to reduce risk, for the purposes specified in paragraphs (4) and (5), and to enhance the information systems capabilities to improve the tracking of pesticide registration decisions. The Administrator shall, prior to expending any such moneys derived from fees

(i) effective October 1, 1997 , adopt specific and cost accounting rules and procedures as approved by the Government Accountability Office and the Inspector General of the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that moneys derived from fees are allocated solely for the purposes specified in the first sentence of this subparagraph;

(ii) prohibit the use of such moneys derived from fees to pay for any costs other than those necessary to achieve the purposes specified in the first sentence of this subparagraph; and

(iii) ensure that personnel and facility costs associated with the functions to be carried out under this paragraph do not exceed agency averages for comparable personnel and facility costs.

(B) The Administrator shall also

(i) complete the review of unreviewed reregistration studies required to support the reregistration eligibility decisions scheduled for completion in accordance with subsection ( l )(2); and

(ii) contract for such outside assistance as may be necessary for review of required studies, using a generally accepted competitive process for the selection of vendors of such assistance.

(3) Review of inert ingredients; expedited processing of similar applications

(A) For each of fiscal years 2018 through 2023, the Administrator shall use between ⅑ and ⅛ of the maintenance fees collected in such fiscal year to obtain sufficient personnel and resources

(i) to review and evaluate inert ingredients; and

(ii) to ensure the expedited processing and review of any application that

(I) proposes the initial or amended registration of an end-use pesticide that, if registered as proposed, would be identical or substantially similar in composition and labeling to a currently-registered pesticide identified in the application, or that would differ in composition and labeling from any such currently-registered pesticide only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;

(II) proposes an amendment to the registration of a registered pesticide that does not require scientific review of data; or

(III) proposes the initial or amended registration of an end use pesticide that, if registered as proposed, would be used for a public health pesticide.

(B) Any amounts made available under subparagraph (A) shall be used to obtain sufficient personnel and resources to carry out the activities described in such subparagraph that are in addition to the personnel and resources available to carry out such activities on October 25, 1988 .

(C) So long as the Administrator has not met the time frames specified in clause (ii) of section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title with respect to any application subject to section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title that was received prior to August 3, 1996 , the Administrator shall use the full amount of the fees specified in subparagraph (A) for the purposes specified therein. Once all applications subject to section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title that were received prior to August 3, 1996 , have been acted upon, no limitation shall be imposed by the preceding sentence of this subparagraph so long as the Administrator meets the time frames specified in clause (ii) of section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title on 90 percent of affected applications in a fiscal year. Should the Administrator not meet such time frames in a fiscal year, the limitations imposed by the first sentence of this subparagraph shall apply until all overdue applications subject to section 136a(c)(3)(B) of this title have been acted upon.
