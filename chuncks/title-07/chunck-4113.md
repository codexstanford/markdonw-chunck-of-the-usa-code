Funds made available under this section shall be distributed among eligible institutions in accordance with this subsection.

3 percent shall be available to the Secretary for administration of this section. These administrative funds may be used for transportation of scientists who are not officers or employees of the United States to research meetings convened for the purpose of assessing research opportunities or research planning.

(3) Distributions

(A) In general

After allocating amounts under paragraph (2), the remainder shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in accordance with this paragraph.

(B) Base amount

Funds up to the total amount made available to all eligible institutions in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978 , under section 3157 of this title , shall be allocated among the eligible institutions in the same proportion as funds made available under section 3157 of this title , for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978 , were allocated among the eligible institutions, as so designated as of that date.

(C) Additional amount

Except as provided in subparagraph (D), of funds in excess of the amount allocated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, 20 per centum shall be allotted among eligible institutions in equal proportions; 40 per centum shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the rural population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total rural population of all the States in which eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated; and the balance shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the farm population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total farm population of all the States in which the eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated. In computing the distribution of funds allocated under this subparagraph, the allotments to Tuskegee University and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University shall be determined as if each institution were in a separate State.

(D) Special amounts

(i) Definitions

In this subparagraph:

(I) Covered fiscal year

The term “covered fiscal year” means the fiscal year for which the qualified eligible institution first received an allocation of $3,000,000 under clause (ii)(I).

(II) Other eligible institution

The term “other eligible institution” means an eligible institution, other than the qualified eligible institution, receiving an allocation of funds under this section.

(III) Qualified eligible institution

The term “qualified eligible institution” means the eligible institution described in clause (ii)(I).

(ii) Fiscal year 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022

(I) In general

Subject to subclause (II), for 1 of fiscal year 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, if the calculation under subparagraph (C) would result in a distribution for a fiscal year of less than $3,000,000 to an eligible institution that first received funds under this section on a date occurring after February 7, 2014 , and before September 30, 2018 , that institution shall receive an allocation of $3,000,000 for that fiscal year.

(II) Limitation

Subclause (I) shall apply only if amounts are appropriated under this section in an amount sufficient to provide that each other eligible institution receiving an allocation of funds under this section for fiscal year 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, as applicable, receives not less than the amount of funds received by that other eligible institution under this section for the preceding fiscal year.

(iii) Subsequent fiscal years

(I) Minimum additional funding amounts

Subject to subclauses (II) and (III), for each fiscal year following the covered fiscal year

(aa) the qualified eligible institution shall receive an allocation under this paragraph of at least $3,000,000; and

(bb) each other eligible institution shall receive an allocation under this paragraph of at least the amount received by such other eligible institution under this subsection for the covered fiscal year.

(II) Shortfall of special amounts

(aa) Applicability

This subclause shall apply to any fiscal year following the covered fiscal year and for which the total amount appropriated under this subsection is insufficient to provide for the minimum additional funding amounts described in subclause (I).

(bb) Reductions in allocations

In the case of a fiscal year to which this subclause applies, reductions in allocations shall be made proportionally from the qualified eligible institution and from each other eligible institution based on the increased amounts (if any) that the qualified eligible institution and each other eligible institution were allocated for the covered fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year immediately preceding the covered fiscal year.

(III) Effect of census

Subclauses (I) and (II) shall not apply in any fiscal year for which a shortfall in the minimum additional funding amounts described in subclause (I) is attributable to the incorporation of new census data into the calculation under paragraph (3)(C), as determined by the Secretary.
