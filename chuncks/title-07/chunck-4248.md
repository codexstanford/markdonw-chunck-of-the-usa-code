#### § 3319k. Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority pilot
##### (b) Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority

(1) Establishment

There is established within the Department of Agriculture a pilot program that shall be known as the Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority (referred to in this section as the “AGARDA”) to carry out advanced research and development.

(2) Goals

The goals of the AGARDA are

(A) to develop and deploy advanced solutions to prevent, prepare, and protect against unintentional and intentional threats to agriculture and food in the United States;

(B) to overcome barriers in the development of agricultural technologies, research tools, and qualified products and projects that enhance export competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and resilience to extreme weather;

(C) to ensure that the United States maintains and enhances its position as a leader in developing and deploying agricultural technologies, research tools, and qualified projects and products that increase economic opportunities and security for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities; and

(D) to undertake advanced research and development in areas in which industry by itself is not likely to do so because of the technological or financial uncertainty.

(3) Leadership

(A) In general

The AGARDA shall be a component of the Office of the Chief Scientist.

(B) Director

(i) In general

The AGARDA shall be headed by a Director, who shall be appointed by the Chief Scientist.

(ii) Qualifications

The Director shall be an individual who, by reason of professional background and experience, is exceptionally qualified to advise the Chief Scientist on, and manage advanced research and development programs and other matters pertaining to

(I) qualified products and projects;

(II) agricultural technologies;

(III) research tools; and

(IV) challenges relating to the matters described in subclauses (I) through (III).

(iii) Relationship within the Department of Agriculture

The Director shall report to the Chief Scientist.
