#### § 7912. Establishment of payment yield
##### (e) Opportunity to partially update yields used to determine counter-cyclical payments

(1) Election to update

If the owner of a farm elects to use the base acres calculation method described in section 7911(a)(1)(A) of this title , the owner shall also have a 1-time opportunity to elect to use 1 of the methods described in paragraph (3) to partially update the payment yields that would otherwise be used in calculating any counter-cyclical payments for covered commodities on the farm.

(2) Time for election

The election under paragraph (1) shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as the Secretary prescribes for the election required under section 7911 of this title .

(3) Methods of updating yields

If the owner of a farm elects to update yields under this subsection, the payment yield for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of calculating counter-cyclical payments only, shall be equal to the yield determined using either of the following:

(A) The sum of the following:

(i) The payment yield applicable for direct payments for the covered commodity on the farm.

(ii) 70 percent of the difference between

(I) the average yield per planted acre for the crop of the covered commodity on the farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the crop of the covered commodity was zero; and

(II) the payment yield applicable for direct payments for the covered commodity on the farm.

(B) 93.5 percent of the average of the yield per planted acre for the crop of the covered commodity on the farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the crop of the covered commodity was zero.

(4) Use of partial county average yield

If the yield per planted acre for a crop of the covered commodity for a farm for any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of the county yield for that commodity, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the county yield for the purpose of determining the average yield under paragraph (3).

(5) Application of election and method to all covered commodities

The owner of a farm may not elect the method described in paragraph (3)(A) for 1 covered commodity on the farm and the method described in paragraph (3)(B) for other covered commodities on the farm.
