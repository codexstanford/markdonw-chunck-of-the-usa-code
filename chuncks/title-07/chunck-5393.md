#### § 6702. Study of global climate change, agriculture, and forestry
##### (a) Crops

(1) In general

The Secretary shall study the effects of global climate change on agriculture and forestry. The study shall, at a minimum address

(A) the effects of simultaneous increases in temperature and carbon dioxide on crops of economic significance;

(B) the effects of more frequent or more severe weather events on such crops;

(C) the effects of potential changes in hydrologic regimes on current crop yields;

(D) the economic effects of widespread and increased drought frequency in the south, midwest, and plains States; and

(E) changes in pest problems due to higher temperatures.

(2) Further studies

If the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1) warrant, the Secretary shall conduct further studies that address the means of mitigating the effects of global climate change on crops of economic significance that shall, at a minimum

(A) identify whether climate change tolerance can be bred into these crops, the amount of time necessary for any such breeding, and the effects on the income of farmers;

(B) evaluate existing genetic resource and breeding programs for crops for their ability to develop new varieties that can tolerate potential climate changes; and

(C) assess the potential for the development of crop varieties that are tolerant to climate changes and other environmental stresses, such as drought, pests, and salinity.
