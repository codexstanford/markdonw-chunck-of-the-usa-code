#### § 1994. Maximum amounts for loans authorized; long-term cost projections
##### (c) Development of long-term cost projections for loan program authorizations

The Secretary shall develop long-term cost projections for loan program authorizations required under subsection (a) of this section. Each such projection shall include analyses of (1) the long-term costs of the lending levels that the Secretary requests to be authorized under subsection (a) of this section and (2) the long-term costs for increases in lending levels beyond those requested to be authorized, based on increments of $10,000,000 or such other levels as the Secretary deems appropriate. Long-term cost projections for the three-year period beginning with fiscal year 1983 and each three-year period thereafter shall be submitted to the House Committee on Agriculture, the House Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations at the time the requests for authorizations for those periods are submitted to Congress. Not later than fifteen days after October 13, 1980 , the Secretary shall submit to such committees long-term cost projections covering authorized lending levels for the loan programs for fiscal years 1981 and 1982.
