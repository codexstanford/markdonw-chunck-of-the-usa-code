(2) Exception

The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary and based on a showing of special circumstances and good cause, permit the private capital of a rural business investment company described in paragraph (1)(B) to be less than $10,000,000, but not less than $5,000,000, if the Secretary determines that the action would not create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government.

(3) Time frame

Each rural business investment company shall have a period of 2 years to meet the capital requirements of this subsection.

(4) Adequacy

In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(B) determine that the rural business investment company will be able to comply with the requirements of this subchapter;

(C) require that at least 75 percent of the capital of each rural business investment company is invested in rural business concerns and not more than 10 percent of the investments shall be made in an area containing a city of over 150,000 in the last decennial census and the Census Bureau defined urbanized area containing or adjacent to that city;

(D) ensure that the rural business investment company is designed primarily to meet equity capital needs of the businesses in which the rural business investment company invests and not to compete with traditional small business financing by commercial lenders; and

(E) require that the rural business investment company makes short-term non-equity investments of less than 5 years only to the extent necessary to preserve an existing investment.
