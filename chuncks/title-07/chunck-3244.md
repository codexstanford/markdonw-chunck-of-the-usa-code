Prior to the approval of State agencies to establish longitudinal databases under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall

(A) identify features that shall be standard across States such as database format to facilitate use of longitudinal databases established under paragraph (1) for research purposes;

(B) identify features of longitudinal databases established under paragraph (1) that may vary across States;

(C) identify a procedure for States operating longitudinal databases under paragraph (1) to use a unique identifier to provide relevant information on household members who receive benefits under the supplemental nutrition assistance program for the purpose of comparing participation data in multiple participating States over time while protecting participant privacy;

(D) establish the manner in which data security and privacy protections, as required by Federal law and consistent with other appropriate practices, shall be implemented and maintained;

(E) provide direction to State agencies on the responsibilities of and funding arrangements for State agencies and any State contractors (including entities providing technical assistance) relating to the establishment and operation of a longitudinal database;

(F) provide a description of the documentation that States shall submit to the Secretary prior to allowing researchers access to a longitudinal database;

(G) consult with other Federal research agencies, including the Bureau of the Census;

(H) consult with States that have already established databases used for purposes similar to the purposes outlined in this subsection; and

(I) identify any other requirements determined appropriate by the Secretary.

(4) Included data

(A) In general

(B) Contents

The report required under subparagraph (A) shall describe

(i) the cost of expanding implementation of longitudinal databases with consistent data to every State;

(ii) the challenges and benefits of using State longitudinal databases with consistent data; and

(iii) alternatives to expanding implementation of longitudinal databases with consistent data to every State that may achieve similar research outcomes and the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives.

(8) Effect

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent or limit the ability of State agencies to establish or continue operating databases used for purposes similar to the purposes outlined in this subsection.

(9) Funding

Of the funds made available under section 2027 of this title , the Secretary shall use to carry out this subsection
