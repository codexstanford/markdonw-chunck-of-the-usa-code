### CHAPTER 115— AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY POLICY AND PROGRAMS
#### § 9013. Payment yields
##### (d) Single opportunity to update yields

(1) Election to update

At the sole discretion of the owner of a farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time opportunity to update, on a covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis, the payment yield that would otherwise be used in calculating any price loss coverage payment for each covered commodity on the farm for which the election is made.

(2) Method of updating yields for covered commodities

If the owner of a farm elects to update yields under paragraph (1), the payment yield for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of calculating price loss coverage payments only, shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying

(A) 90 percent;

(B) the average of the yield per planted acre for the crop of covered commodities on the farm for the 2013 through 2017 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the covered commodity was zero; and

(C) subject to paragraph (3), the ratio obtained by dividing

(i) the average of the 2008 through 2012 national average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity, as determined by the Secretary; by

(ii) the average of the 2013 through 2017 national average yield per planted acre for the covered commodity, as determined by the Secretary.

(3) Limitation

In no case shall the ratio obtained under paragraph (2)(C) be less than 90 percent or greater than 100 percent.

(4) Use of county average yield

For the purposes of determining the average yield per planted acre under paragraph (2)(B), if the yield per planted acre for a crop of a covered commodity for a farm for any of the crop years described in that subparagraph was less than 75 percent of the average of county yields for those crop years for that commodity, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the average of the 2013 through 2017 county yield for the covered commodity.

(5) Upland cotton conversion

In the case of seed cotton, for purposes of determining the average of the yield per planted acre under this subsection, the average yield for seed cotton per planted acre shall be equal to 2.4 times the average yield for upland cotton per planted acre.

(6) Time for election

An election under this subsection shall be made at a time and manner so as to be in effect beginning with the 2020 crop year, as determined by the Secretary.
