(I) in which there is clear evidence that an event or series of events described in clause (ii) has occurred

(aa) that causes human suffering; and

(bb) for which a government concerned has not chosen, or has not the means, to remedy; or

(II) a human-made emergency resulting in

(aa) a significant influx of refugees;

(bb) the internal displacement of populations; or

(cc) the suffering of otherwise affected populations;

(III) food scarcity conditions caused by slow-onset events, such as drought, crop failure, pest infestation, and disease, that result in an erosion of the ability of communities and vulnerable populations to meet food needs; and

(IV) severe food access or availability conditions resulting from sudden economic shocks, market failure, or economic collapse, that result in an erosion of the ability of communities and vulnerable populations to meet food needs.

(B) Releases

(i) In general

Any funds or commodities held in the trust may be released to provide food, and cover any associated costs, under title II of the Food for Peace Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.)

(I) to assist in averting an emergency, including during the period immediately preceding the emergency;

(II) to respond to an emergency; or

(III) for recovery and rehabilitation after an emergency.

(ii) Procedure

A release under clause (i) shall be carried out in the same manner, and pursuant to the same authority as provided in title II of that Act.

(C) Insufficiency of other funds

The funds and commodities held in the trust shall be made immediately available on a determination by the Administrator that funds available for emergency needs under title II of that Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.) for a fiscal year are insufficient to meet emergency needs during the fiscal year.

(D) Waiver relating to minimum tonnage requirements

Nothing in this paragraph requires a waiver by the Administrator of the Agency for International Development under section 204(a)(3) of the Food for Peace Act ( 7 U.S.C. 1724(a)(3) ) as a condition for a release of funds or commodities under subparagraph (B).

The Secretary may exchange an eligible commodity for another United States commodity of equal value, including powdered milk, pulses, and vegetable oil.

(4) Use of normal commercial practices

To the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the purposes of this section and the effective and efficient administration of this section, the Secretary shall use the usual and customary channels, facilities, arrangements, and practices of trade and commerce to carry out this subsection.
