##### (e) Selection criteria

In selecting applicants for grants under the Program, the Secretary shall consider the following:

(1) The energy efficiency of the proposed community wood energy system or innovative wood product facility.

(2) The cost effectiveness of the proposed community wood energy system or innovative wood product facility.

(3) The extent to which the proposed community wood energy system or innovative wood product facility represents the best available commercial technology.

(4) The extent to which the proposed community wood energy system uses the most stringent control technology that has been required or achieved in practice for a wood-fired boiler of similar size and type.

(5)

(A) The extent to which the proposed community wood energy system will displace conventional fossil fuel generation.

(B) Whether the proposed community wood energy system minimizes emission increases to the greatest extent possible.

(6) The extent to which the proposed community wood energy system will increase delivered thermal efficiency of the systems replaced.

(7) The extent to which the applicant has demonstrated a high likelihood of project success by completing detailed engineering and design work in advance of the grant application.

(8) Other technical, economic, conservation, and environmental criteria that the Secretary considers appropriate.
