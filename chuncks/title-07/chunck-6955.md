(ii) Information regarding the manner in which the owner must make the election and the manner of notifying the Secretary of the election.

(iii) Information regarding the deadline before which the owner must notify the Secretary of the election to be in effect beginning with the 2014 crop year.

(C) Effect of failure to make election

If the owner of a farm fails to make the election under this subsection, or fails to timely notify the Secretary of the election as required by subparagraph (B)(iii), the owner shall be deemed to have elected to retain base acres, including generic base acres, as provided in paragraph (2).

(2) Retention of base acres

(A) Election to retain

For the purpose of applying this subchapter to a covered commodity, the Secretary shall give an owner of a farm an opportunity to elect to retain all of the base acres for each covered commodity on the farm.

(B) Treatment of generic base acres

Generic base acres are automatically retained.

(3) Reallocation of base acres

(A) Election to reallocate

For the purpose of applying this subchapter to covered commodities, the Secretary shall give an owner of a farm an opportunity to elect to reallocate all of the base acres for covered commodities on the farm, as in effect on September 30, 2013 , among those covered commodities planted on the farm at any time during the 2009 through 2012 crop years.

(B) Reallocation formula

The reallocation of base acres among covered commodities on a farm shall be in proportion to the ratio of

(i) the 4-year average of

(I) the acreage planted on the farm to each covered commodity for harvest, grazing, haying, silage, or other similar purposes for the 2009 through 2012 crop years; and

(II) any acreage on the farm that the producers were prevented from planting during the 2009 through 2012 crop years to that covered commodity because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers, as determined by the Secretary; to

(ii) the 4-year average of

(I) the acreage planted on the farm to all covered commodities for harvest, grazing, haying, silage, or other similar purposes for such crop years; and

(II) any acreage on the farm that the producers were prevented from planting during such crop years to covered commodities because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers, as determined by the Secretary.

(C) Treatment of generic base acres

Generic base acres are retained and may not be reallocated under this paragraph.

(D) Inclusion of all 4 years in average

For the purpose of determining a 4-year acreage average under subparagraph (B) for a farm, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in which a covered commodity was not planted.

(E) Treatment of multiple planting or prevented planting

For the purpose of determining under subparagraph (B) the acreage on a farm that producers planted or were prevented from planting during the 2009 through 2012 crop years to covered commodities, if the acreage that was planted or prevented from being planted was devoted to another covered commodity in the same crop year (other than a covered commodity produced under an established practice of double cropping), the owner may elect the commodity to be used for that crop year in determining the 4-year average, but may not include both the initial commodity and the subsequent commodity.

(F) Limitation

The reallocation of base acres among covered commodities on a farm under this paragraph may not result in a total number of base acres (including generic base acres) for the farm in excess of the number of base acres in effect for the farm on September 30, 2013 .

(4) Application of election to all covered commodities

The election made under this subsection, or deemed to be made under paragraph (1)(C), with respect to a farm shall apply to all of the covered commodities on the farm.
