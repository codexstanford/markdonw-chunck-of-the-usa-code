(B)

(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), a registered futures commission merchant shall be considered to have complied with a recordkeeping or reporting requirement adopted pursuant to paragraph (2) concerning an affiliated person that is subject to examination by, or reporting requirements of, a Federal banking agency if the futures commission merchant utilizes for the recordkeeping or reporting requirement copies of reports filed by the affiliated person with the Federal banking agency pursuant to section 161 of title 12 , section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act ( 12 U.S.C. 321 et seq.), section 1817(a) of title 12 , section 1467a(b) of title 12 , or section 1844 of title 12 .

(A) notify the agency of the information required with respect to the affiliated person; and
