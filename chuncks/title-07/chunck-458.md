### CHAPTER 6— INSECTICIDES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PESTICIDE CONTROL
#### § 136a. Registration of pesticides
##### (f) Miscellaneous

(1) Effect of change of labeling or formulation

If the labeling or formulation for a pesticide is changed, the registration shall be amended to reflect such change if the Administrator determines that the change will not violate any provision of this subchapter.

(2) Registration not a defense

In no event shall registration of an article be construed as a defense for the commission of any offense under this subchapter. As long as no cancellation proceedings are in effect registration of a pesticide shall be prima facie evidence that the pesticide, its labeling and packaging comply with the registration provisions of the subchapter.

(3) Authority to consult other Federal agencies

In connection with consideration of any registration or application for registration under this section, the Administrator may consult with any other Federal agency.

(4) Mixtures of nitrogen stabilizers and fertilizer products

Any mixture or other combination of

(A) 1 or more nitrogen stabilizers registered under this subchapter; and

(B) 1 or more fertilizer products, shall not be subject to the provisions of this section or sections 136a–1, 136c, 136e, 136m, and 136 o (a)(2) of this title if the mixture or other combination is accompanied by the labeling required under this subchapter for the nitrogen stabilizer contained in the mixture or other combination, the mixture or combination is mixed or combined in accordance with such labeling, and the mixture or combination does not contain any active ingredient other than the nitrogen stabilizer.
