##### (b) Equitable relief

The Secretary may provide relief to any participant that is determined to be not in compliance with the requirements of a covered program, and therefore ineligible for a loan, payment, or other benefit under the covered program, if the participant

(1) acting in good faith, relied on the action or advice of the Secretary (including any authorized representative of the Secretary) to the detriment of the participant; or

(2) failed to comply fully with the requirements of the covered program, but made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements.
