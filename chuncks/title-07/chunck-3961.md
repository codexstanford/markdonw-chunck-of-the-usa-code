#### § 3124a. Federal-State partnership and coordination
##### (a) Covered programs; statement of purposes

A unique partnership arrangement exists in food and agricultural research, extension, and teaching between the Federal Government and the governments of the several States whereby the States have accepted and have supported, through legislation and appropriations

(1) research programs under

(A) the Act of March 2, 1887 ( 7 U.S.C. 361a et seq.), commonly known as the Hatch Act of 1887;

(B) the Act of October 10, 1962 ( 16 U.S.C. 582a et seq.), commonly known as the McIntire-Stennis Act of 1962;

(C) subchapter V of this chapter; and

(D) subchapter VI of this chapter;

(2) extension programs under subchapter VI of this chapter and the Act of May 8, 1914 ( 7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.), commonly known as the Smith-Lever Act;

(3) teaching programs under

(A) the Act of July 2, 1862 ( 7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), commonly known as the First Morrill Act;

(B) the Act of August 30, 1890 ( 7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.), commonly known as the Second Morrill Act; and

(C) the Act of June 29, 1935 ( 7 U.S.C. 329 ), commonly known as the Bankhead-Jones Act; and

(4) international agricultural programs under title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ( 22 U.S.C. 2220a et seq.). This partnership in publicly supported agricultural research, extension, and teaching involving the programs of Federal agencies and the programs of the States has played a major role in the outstanding successes achieved in meeting the varied, dispersed, and in many cases, site-specific needs of American agriculture. This partnership must be preserved and enhanced.
