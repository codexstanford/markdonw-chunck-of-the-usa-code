#### § 1926a. Emergency and imminent community water assistance grant program
##### (d) Uses

(1) In general

Grants made under this section may be used

(A) for waterline extensions from existing systems, laying of new waterlines, repairs, significant maintenance, digging of new wells, equipment replacement, and hook and tap fees;

(B) for any other appropriate purpose associated with developing sources of, treating, storing, or distributing water;

(C) to assist communities in complying with the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ( 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) or the Safe Drinking Water Act ( 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.); and

(D) to provide potable water to communities through other means, other than those covered above for not to exceed 120 days when a more permanent solution is not feasible in a shorter time frame. Where drinking water supplies are inadequate due to an event, as determined by the Secretary, including drought, severe weather, or contamination, the Secretary may provide potable water for an additional period of time not to exceed an additional 120 days in order to protect public health.

(2) Joint proposals

Nothing in this section shall preclude rural communities from submitting joint proposals for emergency water assistance, subject to the restrictions contained in subsection (e). Such restrictions should be considered in the aggregate, depending on the number of communities involved.
