#### § 7333. Administration and operation of noninsured crop assistance program
##### (e) Yield determinations

(1) Establishment

The Secretary shall establish approved yields for purposes of providing noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section.

(2) Actual production history

(A) In general

The Secretary shall determine an approved yield using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years.

(B) Calculation

Subject to paragraph (3), the approved yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.

(3) Assignment of yield

If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the county expected yield (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary based on production history requirements.

(4) Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties

(A) In general

(i) Documentation

If sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the acreage of a crop in a county for the crop year has increased by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not available, if the acreage of the crop in the county has increased significantly from the previous crop years, a producer must provide such detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which benefits are being claimed as is required by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Secretary may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.

(ii) Prohibition

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.

(B) Exception

A crop or a producer shall not be subject to this subsection if

(i) the planted acreage of the producer for the crop has been inspected by a third party acceptable to the Secretary; or

(ii)

(I) the County Executive Director and the State Executive Director recommend an exemption from the requirement to the Administrator of the Agency; and

(II) the Administrator approves the recommendation.

(5) Limitation on receipt of subsequent assigned yield

A producer who receives an assigned yield for the current year of a natural disaster because required production records were not submitted to the local office of the Department shall not be eligible for an assigned yield for the year of the next natural disaster unless the required production records of the previous 1 or more years (as applicable) are provided to the local office.

(6) Yield variations due to different farming practices

The Secretary shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.
