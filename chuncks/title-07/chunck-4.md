### CHAPTER 1— COMMODITY EXCHANGES
#### § 1b. Requirements of Secretary of the Treasury regarding exemption of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from definition of the term “swap”
##### (b) Determination

If the Secretary makes a determination to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of the term “swap”, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a determination that contains

(1) an explanation regarding why foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are qualitatively different from other classes of swaps in a way that would make the foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards ill-suited for regulation as swaps; and

(2) an identification of the objective differences of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards with respect to standard swaps that warrant an exempted status.
