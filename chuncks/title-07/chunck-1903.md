### CHAPTER 36— CROP INSURANCE
#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (b) Catastrophic risk protection

(1) Coverage availability

The Corporation shall offer a catastrophic risk protection plan to indemnify producers for crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, when the producer is unable, because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary), to plant other crops for harvest on the acreage for the crop year.

(2) Amount of coverage

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B)

(i) in the case of each of the 1995 through 1998 crop years, catastrophic risk protection shall offer a producer coverage for a 50 percent loss in yield, on an individual yield or area yield basis, indemnified at 60 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage (as determined by the Corporation); and

(ii) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop years, catastrophic risk protection shall offer a producer coverage for a 50 percent loss in yield, on an individual yield or area yield basis, indemnified at 55 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage (as determined by the Corporation).

(B) Reduction in actual payment

The amount paid to a producer on a claim under catastrophic risk protection may reflect a reduction that is proportional to the out-of-pocket expenses that are not incurred by the producer as a result of not planting, growing, or harvesting the crop for which the claim is made, as determined by the Corporation.

(3) Alternative catastrophic coverage

Beginning with the 2001 crop year, the Corporation shall offer producers of an agricultural commodity the option of selecting either of the following:

(A) The catastrophic risk protection coverage available under paragraph (2)(A).

(B) An alternative catastrophic risk protection coverage that

(i) indemnifies the producer on an area yield and loss basis if such a policy or plan of insurance is offered for the agricultural commodity in the county in which the farm is located;

(ii) provides, on a uniform national basis, a higher combination of yield and price protection than the coverage available under paragraph (2)(A); and

(iii) the Corporation determines is comparable to the coverage available under paragraph (2)(A) for purposes of subsection (e)(2)(A).

(4) Sale of catastrophic risk coverage

(A) In general

Catastrophic risk coverage may be offered by

(i) approved insurance providers, if available in an area; and

(ii) at the option of the Secretary that is based on considerations of need, local offices of the Department.

(B) Need

For purposes of considering need under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary may take into account the most efficient and cost-effective use of resources, the availability of personnel, fairness to local producers, the needs and convenience of local producers, and the availability of private insurance carriers.

(C) Delivery of coverage

(i) In general

In full consultation with approved insurance providers, the Secretary may continue to offer catastrophic risk protection in a State (or a portion of a State) through local offices of the Department if the Secretary determines that there is an insufficient number of approved insurance providers operating in the State or portion of the State to adequately provide catastrophic risk protection coverage to producers.

(ii) Coverage by approved insurance providers

To the extent that catastrophic risk protection coverage by approved insurance providers is sufficiently available in a State (or a portion of a State) as determined by the Secretary, only approved insurance providers may provide the coverage in the State or portion of the State.

(iii) Timing of determinations

Not later than 90 days after April 4, 1996 , the Secretary shall announce the results of the determinations under clause (i) for policies for the 1997 crop year. For subsequent crop years, the Secretary shall make the announcement not later than April 30 of the year preceding the year in which the crop will be produced, or at such other times during the year as the Secretary finds practicable in consultation with affected crop insurance providers for those States (or portions of States) in which catastrophic coverage remains available through local offices of the Department.

(iv) Current policies

This clause shall take effect beginning with the 1997 crop year. Subject to clause (ii) all catastrophic risk protection policies written by local offices of the Department shall be transferred to the approved insurance provider for performance of all sales, service, and loss adjustment functions. Any fees in connection with such policies that are not yet collected at the time of the transfer shall be payable to the approved insurance providers assuming the policies. The transfer process for policies for the 1997 crop year with sales closing dates before January 1, 1997 , shall begin at the time of the Secretary’s announcement under clause (iii) and be completed by the sales closing date for the crop and county. The transfer process for all subsequent policies (including policies for the 1998 and subsequent crop years) shall begin at a date that permits the process to be completed not later than 45 days before the sales closing date.

(5) Administrative fee

(A) Basic fee

Each producer shall pay an administrative fee for catastrophic risk protection in the amount of $655 per crop per county.

(B) Payment of catastrophic risk protection fee on behalf of producers

(i) Payment authorized

If State law permits a licensing fee to be paid by an insurance provider to a cooperative association or trade association and rebated to a producer through the payment of catastrophic risk protection administrative fees, a cooperative association or trade association located in that State may pay, on behalf of a member of the association in that State or a contiguous State who consents to be insured under such an arrangement, all or a portion of the administrative fee required by this paragraph for catastrophic risk protection.

(ii) Selection of provider

Nothing in this subparagraph limits the option of a producer to select the licensed insurance agent or other approved insurance provider from whom the producer will purchase a policy or plan of insurance or to refuse coverage for which a payment is offered to be made under clause (i).

(iii) Delivery of insurance

Catastrophic risk protection coverage for which a payment is made under clause (i) shall be delivered by a licensed insurance agent or other approved insurance provider.

(iv) Additional coverage encouraged

A cooperative association or trade association, and any approved insurance provider with whom a licensing fee is made, shall encourage producer members to purchase appropriate levels of coverage in order to meet the risk management needs of the member producers.

(C) Time for payment

The administrative fee required by this paragraph shall be paid by the producer on the same date on which the premium for a policy of additional coverage would be paid by the producer.

(D) Use of fees

(i) In general

The amounts paid under this paragraph shall be deposited in the crop insurance fund established under section 1516(c) of this title , to be available for the programs and activities of the Corporation.

(ii) Limitation

No funds deposited in the crop insurance fund under this subparagraph may be used to compensate an approved insurance provider or agent for the delivery of services under this subsection.

(E) Waiver of fee

(i) In general

The Corporation shall waive the amounts required under this paragraph for limited resource farmers and beginning farmers or ranchers, as defined by the Corporation, and veteran farmers or ranchers.

(ii) Coordination

The Corporation shall coordinate with other agencies of the Department that provide programs or services to farmers and ranchers described in clause (i) to make available coverage under the waiver under that clause and to share eligibility information to reduce paperwork and avoid duplication.

(6) Participation requirement

A producer may obtain catastrophic risk coverage for a crop of the producer on land in the county only if the producer obtains the coverage for the crop on all insurable land of the producer in the county.

(7) Limitation due to risk

The Corporation may limit catastrophic risk coverage in any county or area, or on any farm, on the basis of the insurance risk concerned.

(8) Transitional coverage for 1995 crops

Effective only for a 1995 crop planted or for which insurance attached prior to January 1, 1995 , the Corporation shall allow producers of the crops until not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 [ Oct. 13, 1994 ] to obtain catastrophic risk protection for the crop. On enactment of such Act, a producer who made timely purchases of a crop insurance policy before the date of enactment of such Act, under the provisions of this subchapter then in effect, shall be eligible for the same benefits to which a producer would be entitled under comparable additional coverage under subsection (c).

(9) Simplification

(A) Catastrophic risk protection plans

In developing and carrying out the policies and procedures for a catastrophic risk protection plan under this subchapter, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize the paperwork required and the complexity and costs of procedures governing applications for, processing, and servicing of the plan for all parties involved.

(B) Other plans

To the extent that the policies and procedures developed under subparagraph (A) may be applied to other plans of insurance offered under this subchapter without jeopardizing the actuarial soundness or integrity of the crop insurance program, the Corporation shall apply the policies and procedures to the other plans of insurance within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the Corporation) after the effective date of this paragraph.

(10) Loss adjustment

The rate for reimbursing an approved insurance provider or agent for expenses incurred by the approved insurance provider or agent for loss adjustment in connection with a policy of catastrophic risk protection shall not exceed 6 percent of the premium for catastrophic risk protection that is used to define loss ratio.
