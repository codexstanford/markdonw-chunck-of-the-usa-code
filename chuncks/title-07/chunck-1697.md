### CHAPTER 35A— PRICE SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES
#### § 1427. Commodity Credit Corporation sales price restrictions
##### (f) Efficient operations

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), the foregoing restrictions of this section shall not apply to sales of commodities the disposition of which is desirable in the interest of the effective and efficient conduct of the operations of the Corporation because of the small quantities involved, or because of age, location or questionable continued storability of the commodity.

(2) Offsets

The sales shall be offset (if necessary) by the purchases of commodities as the Corporation determines is appropriate to prevent the sales from substantially impairing any price support program or unduly affecting market prices, except that the purchase price shall not exceed the Corporation’s minimum sales price for the commodities for unrestricted use.

(3) Competitive bid basis

Subject to the sales price restrictions contained in this section, the Corporation may sell any basic agricultural commodity or storable nonbasic commodity on a competitive bid basis, if the sale is determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.
