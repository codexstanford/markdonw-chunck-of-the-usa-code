(B) the day before the date of the event that caused the harm to the livestock that resulted in a reduced sale price.

A payment made under paragraph (1) to an eligible producer on a farm that sold livestock for a reduced sale price shall

(A) be made if the sale occurs within a reasonable period following the event, as determined by the Secretary; and
