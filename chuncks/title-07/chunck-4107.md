(2) Base amount

Any funds annually appropriated under this section up to the amount appropriated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978 , pursuant to section 343(d) of this title , for eligible institutions, shall be allocated among the eligible institutions in the same proportion as funds appropriated under section 343(d) of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978 , were allocated among the eligible institutions, as so designated as of that date.

(3) Additional amount

Any funds appropriated annually under this section in excess of an amount equal to the amount appropriated under section 343(d) of this title , for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978 , for eligible institutions, shall be distributed as follows:

(A) A sum equal to 4 per centum of the total amount appropriated each fiscal year under this section shall be allotted to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the Department of Agriculture for administrative, technical, and other services, and for coordinating the extension work of the Department of Agriculture and the several States.

(B) Except as provided in paragraph (4), of the remainder, 20 per centum shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in equal proportions; 40 per centum shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the rural population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total rural population of all the States in which eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated; and the balance shall be allotted among the eligible institutions in the proportion that the farm population of the State in which each eligible institution is located bears to the total farm population of all the States in which the eligible institutions are located, as determined by the last preceding decennial census current at the time each such additional sum is first appropriated.

(C) In computing the distribution of funds allocated under this paragraph, the allotments to Tuskegee University and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University shall be determined as if each institution were in a separate State.

(4) Special amounts

(A) Definitions

In this paragraph:

(i) Covered fiscal year

The term “covered fiscal year” means the fiscal year for which the qualified eligible institution first received an allocation of $3,000,000 under subparagraph (B)(i).

(ii) Other eligible institution

The term “other eligible institution” means an eligible institution, other than the qualified eligible institution, receiving an allocation of funds under this section.

(iii) Qualified eligible institution

(B) Fiscal year 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), for 1 of fiscal year 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, if the calculation under paragraph (3)(B) would result in a distribution for a fiscal year of less than $3,000,000 to an eligible institution that first received funds under this section on a date occurring after February 7, 2014 , and before September 30, 2018 , that institution shall receive an allocation of $3,000,000 for that fiscal year.

(ii) Limitation

Clause (i) shall apply only if amounts are appropriated under this section in an amount sufficient to provide that each other eligible institution receiving an allocation of funds under this section for fiscal year 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, as applicable, receives not less than the amount of funds received by that other eligible institution under this section for the preceding fiscal year.

(C) Subsequent fiscal years

(i) Minimum additional funding amounts

Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), for each fiscal year following the covered fiscal year

(I) the qualified eligible institution shall receive an allocation under this subsection of at least $3,000,000; and

(II) each other eligible institution shall receive an allocation under this subsection of at least the amount received by such other eligible institution under this subsection for the covered fiscal year.

(ii) Shortfall of special amounts

(I) Applicability

This clause shall apply to any fiscal year following the covered fiscal year and for which the total amount appropriated under this section is insufficient to provide for the minimum additional funding amounts described in clause (i).

(II) Reductions in allocations

In the case of a fiscal year to which this clause applies, reductions in allocations shall be made proportionally from the qualified eligible institution and from each other eligible institution based on the increased amounts (if any) that the qualified eligible institution and each other eligible institution were allocated for the covered fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year immediately preceding the covered fiscal year.

(iii) Effect of census

Clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply in any fiscal year for which a shortfall in the minimum additional funding amounts described in clause (i) is attributable to the incorporation of new census data into the calculation under paragraph (3), as determined by the Secretary.
