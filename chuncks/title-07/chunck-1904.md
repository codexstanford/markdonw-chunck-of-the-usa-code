#### § 1508. Crop insurance
##### (c) General coverage levels

(1) Additional coverage generally

(A) In general

The Corporation shall offer to producers of agricultural commodities grown in the United States plans of crop insurance that provide additional coverage.

(B) Purchase

To be eligible for additional coverage, a producer must apply to an approved insurance provider for purchase of additional coverage if the coverage is available from an approved insurance provider. If additional coverage is unavailable privately, the Corporation may offer additional coverage plans of insurance directly to producers.

(2) Transfer of relevant information

If a producer has already applied for catastrophic risk protection at the local office of the Department and elects to purchase additional coverage, the relevant information for the crop of the producer shall be transferred to the approved insurance provider servicing the additional coverage crop policy.

(3) Yield and loss basis options

A producer shall have the option of purchasing additional coverage based on

(A)

(i) an individual yield and loss basis; or

(ii) an area yield and loss basis;

(B) an individual yield and loss basis, supplemented with coverage based on an area yield and loss basis to cover a part of the deductible under the individual yield and loss policy, as described in paragraph (4)(C); or

(C) a margin basis alone or in combination with the coverages available under subparagraph (A) or (B).

(4) Level of coverage

(A) Dollar denomination and percentage of yield

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the level of coverage

(i) shall be dollar denominated; and

(ii) may be purchased at any level not to exceed 85 percent of the individual yield or 95 percent of the area yield (as determined by the Corporation).

(B) Information

The Corporation shall provide producers with information on catastrophic risk and additional coverage in terms of dollar coverage (within the allowable limits of coverage provided in this paragraph).

(C) Supplemental coverage option

(i) In general

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of the supplemental coverage option described in paragraph (3)(B), the Corporation shall offer producers the opportunity to purchase coverage in combination with a policy or plan of insurance offered under this subchapter that would allow indemnities to be paid to a producer equal to a part of the deductible under the policy or plan of insurance

(I) at a county-wide level to the fullest extent practicable; or

(II) in counties that lack sufficient data, on the basis of such larger geographical area as the Corporation determines to provide sufficient data for purposes of providing the coverage.

(ii) Trigger

Coverage offered under paragraph (3)(B) and clause (i) shall be triggered only if the losses in the area exceed 14 percent of normal levels (as determined by the Corporation).

(iii) Coverage

Subject to the trigger described in clause (ii), coverage offered under paragraph (3)(B) and clause (i) shall not exceed the difference between

(I) 86 percent; and

(II) the coverage level selected by the producer for the underlying policy or plan of insurance.

(iv) Ineligible crops and acres

Crops for which the producer has elected under section 9016 of this title to receive agriculture risk coverage and acres that are enrolled in the stacked income protection plan under section 1508b of this title shall not be eligible for supplemental coverage under this subparagraph.

(v) Calculation of premium

Notwithstanding subsection (d), the premium for coverage offered under paragraph (3)(B) and clause (i) shall

(I) be sufficient to cover anticipated losses and a reasonable reserve; and

(II) include an amount for operating and administrative expenses established in accordance with subsection (k)(4)(F).

(5) Expected market price

(A) Establishment or approval

For the purposes of this subchapter, the Corporation shall establish or approve the price level (referred to in this subchapter as the “expected market price”) of each agricultural commodity for which insurance is offered.

(B) General rule

Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (C), the expected market price of an agricultural commodity shall be not less than the projected market price of the agricultural commodity, as determined by the Corporation.

(C) Other authorized approaches

The expected market price of an agricultural commodity

(i) may be based on the actual market price of the agricultural commodity at the time of harvest, as determined by the Corporation;

(ii) in the case of revenue and other similar plans of insurance, may be the actual market price of the agricultural commodity, as determined by the Corporation;

(iii) in the case of cost of production or similar plans of insurance, shall be the projected cost of producing the agricultural commodity, as determined by the Corporation; or

(iv) in the case of other plans of insurance, may be an appropriate amount, as determined by the Corporation.

(D) Grain sorghum price election

(i) In general

The Corporation, in conjunction with the Secretary (referred to in this subparagraph as the “Corporation”), shall

(I) not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, make available all methods and data, including data from the Economic Research Service, used by the Corporation to develop the expected market prices for grain sorghum under the production and revenue-based plans of insurance of the Corporation; and

(II) request applicable data from the grain sorghum industry.

(ii) Expert reviewers

(I) In general

Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the Corporation shall contract individually with 5 expert reviewers described in subclause (II) to develop and recommend a methodology for determining an expected market price for sorghum for both the production and revenue-based plans of insurance to more accurately reflect the actual price at harvest.

(II) Requirements

The expert reviewers under subclause (I) shall be comprised of agricultural economists with experience in grain sorghum and corn markets, of whom

(aa) 2 shall be agricultural economists of institutions of higher education;

(bb) 2 shall be economists from within the Department; and

(cc) 1 shall be an economist nominated by the grain sorghum industry.

(iii) Recommendations

(I) In general

Not later than 90 days after the date of contracting with the expert reviewers under clause (ii), the expert reviewers shall submit, and the Corporation shall make available to the public, the recommendations of the expert reviewers.

(II) Consideration

The Corporation shall consider the recommendations under subclause (I) when determining the appropriate pricing methodology to determine the expected market price for grain sorghum under both the production and revenue-based plans of insurance.

(III) Publication

Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Corporation receives the recommendations of the expert reviewers, the Corporation shall publish the proposed pricing methodology for both the production and revenue-based plans of insurance for notice and comment and, during the comment period, conduct at least 1 public meeting to discuss the proposed pricing methodologies.

(iv) Appropriate pricing methodology

(I) In general

Not later than 180 days after the close of the comment period in clause (iii)(III), but effective not later than the 2010 crop year, the Corporation shall implement a pricing methodology for grain sorghum under the production and revenue-based plans of insurance that is transparent and replicable.

Until the date on which the new pricing methodology is implemented, the Corporation may continue to use the pricing methodology that the Corporation determines best establishes the expected market price.

(III) Availability

On an annual basis, the Corporation shall make available the pricing methodology and data used to determine the expected market prices for grain sorghum under the production and revenue-based plans of insurance, including any changes to the methodology used to determine the expected market prices for grain sorghum from the previous year.

(6) Price elections

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B), insurance coverage shall be made available to a producer on the basis of any price election that equals or is less than the price election established by the Corporation. The coverage shall be quoted in terms of dollars per acre.

(B) Minimum price elections

The Corporation may establish minimum price elections below which levels of insurance shall not be offered.

(C) Wheat classes and malting barley

The Corporation shall, as the Corporation determines practicable, offer producers different price elections for classes of wheat and malting barley (including contract prices in the case of malting barley), in addition to the standard price election, that reflect different market prices, as determined by the Corporation. The Corporation shall, as the Corporation determines practicable, offer additional coverage for each class determined under this subparagraph and charge a premium for each class that is actuarially sound.

(D) Organic crops

(i) In general

As soon as possible, but not later than the 2015 reinsurance year, the Corporation shall offer producers of organic crops price elections for all organic crops produced in compliance with standards issued by the Department of Agriculture under the national organic program established under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 ( 7 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) that reflect the actual retail or wholesale prices, as appropriate, received by producers for organic crops, as determined by the Secretary using all relevant sources of information.

(ii) Annual report

The Corporation shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate an annual report on progress made in developing and improving Federal crop insurance for organic crops, including

For levels of additional coverage equal to 65 percent or more of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage, a producer may elect to delete from the additional coverage any coverage against damage caused by fire and hail if the producer obtains an equivalent or greater dollar amount of coverage for damage caused by fire and hail from an approved insurance provider. On written notice of the election to the company issuing the policy providing additional coverage and submission of evidence of substitute coverage on the commodity insured, the premium of the producer shall be reduced by an amount determined by the Corporation to be actuarially appropriate, taking into account the actuarial value of the remaining coverage provided by the Corporation.

(8) State premium subsidies

The Corporation may enter into an agreement with any State or agency of a State under which the State or agency may pay to the approved insurance provider an additional premium subsidy to further reduce the portion of the premium paid by producers in the State.
