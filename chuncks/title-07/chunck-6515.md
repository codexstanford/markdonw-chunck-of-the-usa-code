(2) Availability of partial payments

If, before the end of the 12-month marketing year, the Secretary estimates that counter-cyclical payments will be required under this section for a crop year, the Secretary shall give producers on a farm (or, in the case of the 2002 crop year, historic peanut producers) the option to receive partial payments of the counter-cyclical payment projected to be made for that crop.
