### CHAPTER 35— AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1938
#### § 1379d. Marketing restrictions
##### (d) “Food products” defined; exemption of flour second clears

As used in this part, the term “food products” means flour (excluding flour second clears not used for human consumption as determined by the Secretary), semolina, farina, bulgur, beverage, and any other product composed wholly or partly of wheat which the Secretary may determine to be a food product. The Secretary may at his election administer the exemption for wheat processed into flour second clears through refunds either to processors of such wheat or to the users of such clears. For the purpose of such refunds, the wheat equivalent of flour second clears may be determined on the basis of conversion factors authorized by section 1379f of this title , even though certificates had been surrendered on the basis of the weight of the wheat.
