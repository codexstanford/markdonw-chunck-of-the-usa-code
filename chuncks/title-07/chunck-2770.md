######## (E) Within 30 days after a borrower of a guaranteed loan is in default of any principal or interest payment due for 60 days or more, the Secretary shall

(i) purchase the pool certificates representing ownership of the guaranteed portion of the loan; and

(ii) pay the registered holder of the certificates an amount equal to the guaranteed portion of the loan represented by the certificate.

(F)

(i) If the Secretary pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, the claim shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment, as may be provided by the Secretary.

(ii) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Secretary of the Secretary’s ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the pool against which the certificates are issued.

(3) On the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Secretary shall do the following:

(A) Provide for the central collection of registration information from all participating market makers for all loans and pool certificates sold under paragraphs (1) and (2). Such information shall include, with respect to each original sale and any subsequent sale, identification of the interest rate paid by the borrower to the lender, the lender’s servicing fee, whether interest on the loan is at a fixed or variable rate, identification of each purchaser of a pool certificate, the interest rate paid on the certificate, and such other information as the Secretary deems appropriate.

(B) Before any sale, require the seller to disclose to each prospective purchaser of the portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to each prospective purchaser of a pool certificate issued under paragraph (2), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this subparagraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term “seller” does not include (i) the person who made the loan or (ii) any person who sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year.

(C) Provide for adequate custody of any pooled guaranteed loans.

(D) Take such actions as are necessary, in restructuring pools of the guaranteed portion of loans, to minimize the estimated costs of paying claims under guarantees issued under this subsection.

(E) Require each market maker

(i) to service all pools formed, and participations sold, by the market maker; and

(ii) to provide the Secretary with information relating to the collection and disbursement of all periodic payments, prepayments, and default funds from lenders, to or from the reserve fund that the Secretary shall establish to enable the timely payment guarantee to be self-funding, and from all beneficial holders.

(F) Regulate market makers in pool certificates sold under this subsection.

(4) The Secretary may contract for goods and services to be used for the purposes of this subsection without regard to the provisions of titles 5, 40, and 41, and any regulations issued thereunder.
