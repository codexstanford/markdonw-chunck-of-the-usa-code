#### § 231r. Automatic benefit eligibility requirement adjustments
##### (c) Reduced conditions of entitlement; expanded benefits

If section 226 [ 42 U.S.C. 426 ] or title XVIII [ 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] of the Social Security Act is amended at any time after December 31, 1974 , to reduce the conditions of entitlement to, or to expand the nature of, the benefits payable thereunder, or if health care benefits in addition to, or in lieu of, the benefits payable under such section 226 or such title XVIII are provided by any provision of law which becomes effective at any time after December 31, 1974 , such reductions in the conditions of entitlement to benefits, such expanded benefits, or such additional, or substituted, health care benefits shall be available to every employee (as defined in this subchapter), and those deriving from him, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if his service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]. The Board shall have the same authority, in accordance with regulations prescribed by it, to determine the rights of employees who will have completed ten years of service (or five or more years of service, all of which accrues after December 31, 1995 ), and of those deriving from such employees, to benefits provided by reason of the provisions of this subsection as the Secretary of Health and Human Services has with respect to individuals insured under the Social Security Act.
