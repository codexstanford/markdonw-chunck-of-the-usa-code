### CHAPTER 9— RETIREMENT OF RAILROAD EMPLOYEES
#### § 231i. Erroneous payments
##### (c) Decision not to recover

There shall be no recovery in any case in which more than the correct amount of annuities or other benefits has been paid under this subchapter to an individual or payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto who, in the judgment of the Board, is without fault when, in the judgment of the Board, recovery would be contrary to the purpose of this subchapter or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [ 45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.] or would be against equity or good conscience.
