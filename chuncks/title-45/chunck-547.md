### CHAPTER 20— NORTHEAST RAIL SERVICE
#### § 1112. Interstate Commerce Commission proceedings
##### (c) Interest of United States attaching in bankruptcy, liquidation, abandonment, etc.

(1) If the Secretary determines under subsection (b) that there is an agreement between a profitable railroad in the Region (as defined in section 702 of this title ) which received a loan under section 721(a) of this title and a prospective purchaser for the sale of such railroad, the Secretary shall limit the interest of the United States in any debt of such a railroad to an interest which attaches to such debt in the event of bankruptcy or substantial sale or liquidation of the assets of the railroad. The Secretary may substitute for the evidence of such debt contingency notes payable solely from the railroad operating assets then securing such debt, including reinvestments thereof, or such other contingency notes as the Secretary deems appropriate and which conform to the terms set forth in this subsection.

(2) If the interest of the United States is limited under paragraph (1), any new debt issued by such a railroad subsequent to the issuance of the debt described in paragraph (1) may have such higher priority in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or abandonment of the assets of such a railroad than the debt described in such paragraph as the Secretary and the railroad may agree.

(3) In carrying out the duties under this subsection, the Secretary may (A) enter into such agreements, (B) in accordance with any such agreements, cancel or cause to be cancelled or amend or cause to be amended any notes or securities currently held by agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, and (C) accept in exchange as substitution therefor such instruments evidencing the indebtedness owed to such agencies or instrumentalities as, in the Secretary’s judgment, will effectuate the purposes of this subsection.
