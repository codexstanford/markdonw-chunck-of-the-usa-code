### CHAPTER 16— REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
#### § 744. Termination and continuation of rail services
##### (a) Discontinuance
######## (A) If rail properties are not, in accordance with the designations in the final system plan, required to be operated, as a consequence of a recommended arrangement for joint use or operation of rail properties (under section 716(g) of this title ) or as part of a coordination project (under sections 716(c) and (g) of this title), rail service on such properties may be discontinued, subsequent to the date of conveyance of rail properties pursuant to such section 743(b)(1) of this title , if the Commission determines that such rail service on such rail properties is not compensatory and if

(i) the petitioner and any other railroad involved in such arrangement or coordination project have, prior to filing an application for such discontinuance, entered into a binding agreement (effective on or before the effective date of such discontinuance) to carry out such arrangement or project;

(ii) such application is filed with the Commission not later than 1 year after the effective date of the final system plan; and

(iii) such discontinuance is not precluded by the terms of the leases and agreements referred to in such section 743(b)(2).

(B) For purposes of this paragraph, rail service on rail properties is compensatory if the revenue attributable to such properties from such service equals or exceeds the sum of the avoidable costs of providing such service on such properties plus a reasonable return on the value of such rail properties, as determined in accordance with the standards developed pursuant to section 10362(b)(6)  1 of title 49.

(C) The Commission shall make its final determination, with respect to any discontinuance requested under this paragraph, not later than 120 days after the date of filing of an application therefor. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that the service involved is not compensatory. If the Commission fails to make a final determination within such time, the application shall be deemed to be granted.

(D) The Commission may issue such rules, regulations, and procedures as it deems necessary for the conduct of its functions under this paragraph.
