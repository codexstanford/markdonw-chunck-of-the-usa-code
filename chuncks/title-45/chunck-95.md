### CHAPTER 9— RETIREMENT OF RAILROAD EMPLOYEES
#### § 231f. Railroad Retirement Board
##### (c) Sources of payments; adjustments

(1) Benefit payments determined by the Board to be payable under this subchapter shall be made by the disbursing agent under subsection (b)(4) from money transferred to it from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust or the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account, as the case may be, except that payments of annuity amounts made under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93–445 shall be made by the disbursing agent under subsection (b)(4) from money transferred to it from the Dual Benefits Payments Account. In any fiscal year, the total amounts paid under such sections shall not exceed the total sums appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for that fiscal year. The Board shall prescribe regulations for allocation of annuity amounts which would without regard to such regulations be payable under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93–445 so that the sums appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for a fiscal year so far as practicable, are expended in equal monthly installments throughout such fiscal year, and are distributed so that recipients are paid annuity amounts which bear the same ratio to the annuity amounts such recipients would have received but for such regulations as the ratio of the total sums appropriated to pay such annuity amounts bear to the total sums necessary to pay such annuity amounts without regard to such regulations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the entitlement of an individual to an annuity amount under section 231b(h), 231c(e), or 231c(h) of this title or section 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), or 207(3) of Public Law 93–445 for any month in which the amount payable to such individual is allocated under the regulations prescribed by the Board under this subsection shall not exceed the amount so allocated for that month to such individual.

(2) At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975 , and each fiscal year thereafter, the Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall determine the amounts, if any, which if added to or subtracted from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would place each such Trust Fund in the same position in which it would have been if (A) service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.] and (B) this subchapter had not been enacted. Such determination with respect to each such Trust Fund shall be made no later than June 15 following the close of the fiscal year. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is to be added to any such Trust Fund, the Board shall, within ten days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to such Trust Fund. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is to be subtracted from any such Trust Fund, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within ten days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from such Trust Fund to the Railroad Retirement Account. Any amounts so certified shall further include interest (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for the fiscal year under consideration) payable from the close of such fiscal year until the date of certification. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, or the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or to any such Trust Fund from the Railroad Retirement Account, as the case may be, such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and certified by the Board or the Secretary of Health and Human Services for transfer from any such Trust Fund or from the Railroad Retirement Account.

(3) For purposes of subdivision (2), for any fiscal year, the rate of interest to be used shall be equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of May 31 preceding the close of such fiscal year, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate.

(4) After the end of each month beginning with the month of October 1983, the Board shall determine the net amount, if any, which if added to or subtracted from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would, with respect to such month, place those Trust Funds, taken as a whole, in the same position in which they would have been if (A) service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], and (B) this subchapter had not been enacted. If for any month the net amount so determined would be subtracted from those Trust Funds, the Board shall, within ten days after the end of such month, report such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the general fund to the Railroad Retirement Account. Any amount so reported shall further include interest (at an annual rate equal to the rate of interest borne by a special obligation issued to the Railroad Retirement Account in the month in which the transfer is made to the Account) payable from the close of the month for which the transfer is made until the date of transfer. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and reported by the Board for transfer. For such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued after August 12, 1983 , under section 3102 of title 31 , and the purpose for which securities may be issued under section 3102 of title 31 are extended to include such purpose. Each such transfer shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury within five days after a report of the amount to be transferred is received. Not later than December 31 following the close of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1984 , the Board shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the total of all amounts transferred pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision for months in such fiscal year. Within ten days after a transfer, or transfers, pursuant to subdivision (2) for a particular fiscal year, the Board shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund an amount equal to (A) the total of all amounts, exclusive of interest, transferred to such Account pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision for months in such fiscal year, plus (B) interest (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for such fiscal year) payable with respect to each amount transferred for a month during such fiscal year from the close of the month for which the transfer of the amount was made until the date of retransfer of such amount. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the preceding sentence of this subdivision and reported by the Board for retransfer.
