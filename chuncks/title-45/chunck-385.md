### CHAPTER 16— REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
#### § 745. Continuing reorganization; supplemental transactions
##### (e) “Fair and equitable” defined

As used in this section, the term “fair and equitable” means fair and equitable, in accordance with the standards applicable to the approval of a plan of reorganization (or a step in such plan) under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act  1 to

(1) the estates of railroads in reorganization in the region and persons leased, operated, or controlled by such railroads who have conveyed rail properties, under section 743(b)(1) of this title , in exchange for securities of the Corporation, the Association, or profitable railroads and other benefits provided as a consequence of this chapter and to any subsequent holders of such securities at the time of the supplemental transaction involved; and

(2) the holders of other securities of the Corporation. Whenever any property or securities of the Corporation are required to be valued in order to determine whether the terms of a supplemental transaction are fair and equitable, the special court shall give proper recognition to the contributions to the Corporation by all classes of security holders, except that such court shall not assign to the series B preferred stock or the common stock of the Corporation any values added to those securities, by reason of investment by the Association in debentures and series A preferred stock of the Corporation, in excess of any value required by constitutional principles applicable to a reorganization process.
