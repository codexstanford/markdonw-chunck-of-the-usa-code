### CHAPTER 16— REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
#### § 745. Continuing reorganization; supplemental transactions
##### (f) Expedited proposals

(1) Within 240 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the Secretary, after providing an opportunity for comments from interested parties, shall determine whether to initiate a proposal for a supplemental transaction under this section for the transfer of all rail properties of the Corporation in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island to another railroad in the region. If the Secretary determines that

(A) the proposed transferee railroad is financially and operationally capable of assuming the freight operations and freight service obligations of the Corporation on a financially self-sustaining basis;

(B) the proposed transfer would promote the establishment and retention of a financially self-sustaining rail system in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island adequate to meet the needs of such States; and

(C) the proposed transfer is consistent with the goals set forth in section 716(a)(8) of this title , the Secretary shall develop such a proposal and may, after providing the Association, the Commission, and the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island an opportunity to review and comment on such proposal, petition the special court for an order to carry out such proposal.

(2)

(A) Within 10 days after August 13, 1981 , the Secretary shall initiate discussions and negotiations for the transfer of some or all of the Corporation’s rail properties and freight service obligations in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island to one or more parties under a plan which provides for continued rail freight service on all lines operated by the Corporation on August 13, 1981 , for at least four years.
