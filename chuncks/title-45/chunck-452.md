#### § 904. Court approved abandonments and sales
##### (a) Abandonment of lines of railroad under section 1170 of title 11

(1) Upon the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of this title , or on April 1, 1980 , whichever first occurs, the bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to section 1170 of title 11 . Pending the expiration of the time for appeal of an abandonment order or the determination of any such appeal, the bankruptcy court may authorize the termination of service on a line to be abandoned, and the order authorizing such termination may not be stayed. In authorizing any abandonment pursuant to this section, the court shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that required under section 11347  1 of title 49.

(2) Prior to the date specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the bankruptcy court may hear and consider any request for the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad, and may fix the time for the Commission’s report on the request, but it may take final action authorizing such abandonment only in accordance with such paragraph (1).
