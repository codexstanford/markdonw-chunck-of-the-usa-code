#### § 231b. Computation of annuities
##### (f) Reductions in annuities

(1) If, in the case of an individual whose annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue prior to January 1, 1983 , the annuity (before any reduction due to such individual’s entitlement to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and disregarding any amount provided by subsection (h) of this section) plus the supplemental annuity to which such individual is entitled for any month under this subchapter, together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse of such individual (before any reduction due to such spouse’s entitlement to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit under the Social Security Act and disregarding any amount provided by section 231c(e) of this title ), before any reductions under the provisions of section 231a(f) of this title is less than the total amount which would have been payable to such individual and his spouse for such month, on the basis of the individual’s compensation and years of service, under the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as in effect on December 31, 1974 [ 45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.], disregarding, for purposes of the computations under such Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 compensation for any month after December 31, 1974 , in excess of one-twelfth of the maximum annual taxable “wages” (as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [ 26 U.S.C. 3121 ]) for the calendar year 1974, the annuity of such individual and the annuity of such spouse, if any, shall be increased proportionately so as to equal such total amount. For the purpose of computing amounts under this subdivision, the Board shall have the authority to approximate the effect of the reductions prescribed by sections 3(a)(2) and 3(a)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [ 45 U.S.C. 228c(a)(2) , (a)(3)]. For purposes of computing amounts payable under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, any increases in the amounts determined under the first proviso of section 3(e) of such Act which would have become effective after December 31, 1974 , shall be disregarded.

(2) If for any month in which an annuity accrues and is payable under this subchapter the annuity to which an individual is entitled under this subchapter (or would have been entitled except for a reduction pursuant to a joint and survivor election), together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse and divorced wife of such individual, is less than the total amount, or the additional amount, which would have been payable to all persons for such month under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] if such individual’s service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , were included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act, the annuities of the individual and spouse shall be increased proportionately to such total amount, or such additional amount: Provided, however , That if an annuity accrues to an individual or a spouse for a part of a month, the amount payable for such part of a month under this subdivision shall be one-thirtieth of the amount payable under this subdivision for an entire month, multiplied by the number of days in such part of a month. For purposes of this subdivision, (i) persons not entitled to an annuity under section 231a of this title shall not be included in the computation under this subdivision except a spouse who could qualify for an annuity under section 231a(c) of this title if the individual from whom the spouse’s annuity under this subchapter would derive had attained age 60 or 62, as the case may be, and such individual’s children who meet the definition as such contained in section 216(e) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 416(e) ]; (ii) after an annuity has been certified for payment and this subdivision was inapplicable after allowing for any waiting period under section 223(c)(2) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 423(c)(2) ], and after having considered the inclusion of all persons who were then eligible for inclusion in the computation under this subdivision, or was then applicable but later became inapplicable, any recertification in such annuity under this subdivision shall not take into account persons not entitled to an annuity under section 231a of this title except a spouse who could qualify for an annuity under section 231a(c) of this title when she attains age 60 or 62, as the case may be, if the individual from whom the spouse’s annuity would derive had attained age 60 or 62, as the case may be, and who was married to such individual at the time he applied for his annuity; and (iii) in computing the amount to be paid under this subdivision the only benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which shall be considered shall be those to which the persons included in the computation are entitled.
