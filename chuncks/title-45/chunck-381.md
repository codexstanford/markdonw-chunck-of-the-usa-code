### CHAPTER 16— REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
#### § 745. Continuing reorganization; supplemental transactions
##### (a) Proposals

If the Secretary or the Association determines that, as part of continuing reorganization, further restructuring of rail properties in the region through transactions supplemental to the final system plan would promote the establishment and retention of a financially self-sustaining rail service system in the region adequate to meet the needs of the region, the Secretary or the Association, as the case may be, may develop proposals for such supplemental transactions as are necessary or appropriate to implement the needed restructuring. Transfers of rail properties included in proposals developed by the Association shall be limited to (1) rail properties which would have qualified for designation under section 716(c)(1)(A) of this title but which were not transferred or conveyed under the final system plan, and which the Association finds to be essential to the efficient operations of the Corporation, and (2) transfers, consistent with the final system plan, of rail properties from the Corporation to a subsidiary thereof. Each proposal (other than a proposal developed by the Association) shall be submitted in writing to the Association and shall state and describe any transactions proposed, the rail properties involved, the parties to such transactions, the financial and other terms of such transactions, the purposes of the chapter or the goals of the final system plan intended to be effectuated by such transactions, and such other information incidental thereto as the Association may prescribe. Within 10 days after receipt of a proposal developed by the Secretary, and upon the development of a proposal developed by the Association, the Association shall publish a summary of such proposal in the Federal Register, and shall afford interested persons (including the Corporation when property is to be transferred to or from the Corporation) an opportunity to comment thereon.
