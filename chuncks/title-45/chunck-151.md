### CHAPTER 11— RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
#### § 352. Benefits
##### (g) Payment of accrued benefits upon death

Benefits accrued to an individual but not yet paid at death shall, upon certification by the Board, be paid, without necessity of filing further claims therefor, to the same individual or individuals to whom any accrued annuities under section 231e(a)(1) of this title are paid. In the event that no such accrued annuities are paid, and if application for such accrued benefits is filed prior to the expiration of two years after the death of the individual to whom such benefits accrued, such accrued benefits shall be paid, upon certification by the Board, to the individual or individuals who would be entitled thereto under section 231e(a)(1) of this title if such accrued benefits were accrued annuities. If there is no individual to whom all or any part of such accrued benefits can be paid in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such benefits or part thereof shall escheat to the credit of the account.
