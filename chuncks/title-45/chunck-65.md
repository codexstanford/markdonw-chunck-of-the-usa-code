#### § 231b. Computation of annuities
##### (b) Increased annuities under subsection (a)

(1) The amount of the annuity of an individual provided under subsection (a) shall be increased by an amount equal to seven-tenths of 1 per centum of the product which is obtained by multiplying such individual’s “years of service” by such individual’s “average monthly compensation” as determined under this subsection. The annuity amount payable to the individual under this subsection shall be reduced by 25 per centum of the annuity amount computed for such individual under subsection (h)(1) or (h)(2), and subsection (h)(5), of this section without regard to section 231f(c)(1) of this title . An individual’s “average monthly compensation” for purposes of this subsection shall be the quotient obtained by dividing by 60 such individual’s total compensation for the 60 months, consecutive or otherwise, during which such individual received that individual’s highest monthly compensation, except that no part of any month’s compensation in excess of the maximum amount creditable for any individual for such month under subsection (j) of this section shall be recognized. In determining the months of compensation to be used for purposes of this subsection, the total compensation reported for the individual under section 231h of this title or credited to such individual under subsection (j) of this section for a year divided by the number of months of service credited to such individual under subsection (i) of this section with respect to such year shall be considered the monthly compensation of the individual for each month of service in any year for which records of the Board do not show the amount of compensation paid to the individual on a monthly basis. If the “average monthly compensation” computed under this subsection is not a multiple of $1, it shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.

(2) For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, in determining “average monthly compensation” for an individual who has not engaged in employment for an employer in the 60-month period preceding the month in which such individual’s annuity began to accrue, and whose major employment during such 60-month period was for a United States department or agency named in section 231( o ) of this title, the amount of compensation used with respect to each month used in making such determination shall be the product of

(i) the compensation credited to such individual for such month under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and

(ii) the quotient obtained by dividing

(I) the average of total wages (as de­termined under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 415(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) ]) for the second calendar year preceding the earliest of the year of the individual’s death or the year in which an annuity begins to accrue to such individual (disregarding an annuity based on disability which is terminated because such individual has recovered from such disability if such individual engages in any regular employment after such termination); by

(II) the average of total wages (as de­termined under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 415(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II) ]) for the calendar year during which such month occurred, unless such month occurred prior to calendar year 1951, in which case, the average of total wages so determined for 1951. In no event shall “average monthly compensation” determined for an individual under this subdivision exceed the maximum “average monthly compensation” which can be determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection for any person retiring January 1 of the year in which such individual’s annuity began to accrue.
