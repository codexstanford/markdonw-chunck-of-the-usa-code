#### § 231c. Computation of spouse and survivor annuities
##### (g) Increases in survivor’s annuities in accordance with subsection (f)

(1) The amount of the annuity provided under subsection (f)(1) (other than the last sentence thereof) for a survivor of a deceased individual shall be increased by an amount equal to the appropriate one of the following percentages of that portion of the annuity computed under section 231b(b) of this title , before any reduction on account of age and without regard to any reduction under section 231b(g)(2) of this title , to which such deceased individual would have been entitled for the month such survivor’s annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue if such individual were living (deeming for this purpose that if such individual died before becoming entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title , such individual became entitled to an annuity under subdivision (i) of such section 231a(a)(1) of this title in the month in which such individual died):

(i) In the case of a widow or widower, the increase shall be equal to 50 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity, but the amount of the annuity so determined shall be subject to reduction on account of age in the same manner as is applicable to the annuity amount determined for the widow or widower under subsection (f) and shall be subject to increase as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection.

(ii) In the case of a parent, the increase shall be equal to 35 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity.

(iii) In the case of a child, the increase shall be equal to 15 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity.

(2) Whenever the total amount of the increases based on the deceased individual’s portion of the annuity under section 231b(b) of this title as determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection for all survivors of a deceased employee is

(i) less than an amount equal to 35 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity, the total increase shall, before any deductions under section 231a(g) of this title , be increased proportionately until the total increase is equal to 35 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity; or

(ii) more than an amount equal to 80 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity, the total increase shall, before any deductions under section 231a(g) of this title and before any reduction on account of age, be reduced proportionately until the total increase is equal to 80 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity.

(3) An annuity determined under this subsection for a month prior to the month in which application is filed, shall be reduced to any extent that may be necessary so that it will not render erroneous any annuity which, before the filing of such application, the Board has certified for payment for such prior month.

(4) If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title and if either such widow or widower or such deceased employee will have completed 10 years of service prior to January 1, 1975 , the amount of the annuity of such widow or widower under subdivisions (1) through (3) of this subsection shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which (A) the widow’s or widower’s insurance annuity to which such widow or widower would have been entitled, upon attaining age 65, under section 5(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [ 45 U.S.C. 228e(a) ] as in effect on December 31, 1974 (without regard to the proviso of that section or the first proviso of section 3(e) of that Act [ 45 U.S.C. 228c(e) ] on the basis of the deceased employee’s remuneration and service prior to January 1, 1975 , increased by the same percentage, or percentages, as widow’s and widower’s insurance benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 402 ] are increased during the period from January 1, 1975 , to the later of the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue or the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title began to accrue, exceeds (B) the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower was entitled (after any reductions pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any deductions on account of work) under the preceding provisions of this subsection, subsection (f) of this section, and the amount determined under subsection (h) of this section, before the proviso, as of the later of the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue or the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title began to accrue. If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is not entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title or to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the amount of the annuity to which such widow or widower is entitled under this subsection shall not be less than an amount which would cause the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower is entitled (before any deductions on account of work) under this subsection and subsection (f)(1) of this section to equal the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower was entitled (or would have been entitled except for the provisions of sections 231a(e) and 231a(f) of this title) as a spouse under subsections (a), (b), and (e) of this section (after any reduction on account of age) in the month preceding the employee’s death. If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title or to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act, the amount of the annuity to which such widow or widower is entitled under this subsection shall not be less than an amount which would cause (A) the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower is entitled (after any reductions pursuant to section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social Security Act or subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any deductions on account of work) under this subsection and subsection (f) of this section to equal (B)(i) the total of the annuity amounts, if any, to which such widow or widower was entitled (or would have been entitled except for the provisions of sections 231a(e) and 231a(f) of this title) as a spouse under subsections (a), (b), and (e) of this section (after any reduction on account of age) in the month preceding the employee’s death less (ii), if such widow or widower is entitled to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act but was not entitled to such a benefit in the month preceding the employee’s death, the amount by which the annuity amount payable under subsection (a) of this section to such widow or widower as a spouse in the month preceding the employee’s death would have been reduced by reason of section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social Security Act if such widow or widower had been entitled to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act in the month preceding the employee’s death in an amount equal to the amount of such benefit at the time such benefit first began to accrue to such widow or widower.

(5) This subsection shall not apply to the annuity of a widow, surviving divorced wife, or surviving divorced mother who is entitled to such annuity on the basis of the provisions of section 231a(d)(1)(v) of this title .

(6) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of an individual determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be increased whenever, and by the same percentage or percentages as, the annuity of the individual would have been increased pursuant to section 231b(g)(1) of this title if such individual were still living.

(7) The first and, if necessary, the following time or times after January 1, 1983 , that monthly insurance benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 402 ] are increased, that portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, or under this subsection as in effect before amendment by section 1119(g) of Public Law 97–35 , shall, if such survivor’s annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue before the effective date of such first increase under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], be reduced by the dollar amount by which that portion of the annuity provided such survivor under subsection (f) of this section was increased, after any reduction under subsection (i) of this section, as a result of such increase or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the annuity amount provided such survivor under subsection (f), as reduced under subsection (i), prior to such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.

(8) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall, if the annuity of such survivor is not subject to reduction under subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual was reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title or would have been reduced under such section 231b(g)(2) of this title if such deceased individual had been living at the time such survivor’s annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue (deeming for this purpose, if such individual died before becoming entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title , that such individual became entitled to an annuity under paragraph (i) of such section 231a(a)(1) of this title in the month in which such individual died). In a case where the survivor of a deceased individual is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the reduction provided by the preceding sentence of this subdivision shall be equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual would have been reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title if the annuity of such deceased individual had not been subject to reduction under section 231b(m) of this title . In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.

(9) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under this subsection as in effect before amendment by section 1119(g) of Public Law 97–35 shall, if the annuity of such survivor is not subject to reduction under subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual was reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title or, if such survivor is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], would have been reduced under such section 231b(g)(2) of this title if the annuity of such deceased individual had not been subject to reduction under section 231b(m) of this title . In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.

(10)

(i) If for any month the unreduced annuity provided under this section for a widow or widower is less than the widow’s or widower’s initial minimum amount computed pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subdivision, the unreduced annuity shall be increased to that initial minimum amount. For the purposes of this subdivision, the unreduced annuity is the annuity without regard to any deduction on account of work, without regard to any reduction for entitlement to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title , without regard to any reduction for entitlement to a benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.], and without regard to any reduction for entitlement to a public service pension pursuant to section 202(e)(7), 202(f)(2), or 202(g)(4) of the Social Security Act. 5
