### CHAPTER 16— REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
#### § 726. Debentures and series A preferred stock
##### (c) Finding, direction, and review by Congress

(1) If the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, it may direct the Association

(A) not to purchase any debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation after the date of such affirmative finding; or

(B) to purchase debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation, after the date of such affirmative finding, only in such amounts, at such times, and on such terms and conditions (notwithstanding subsection (e)(1) of this section) as the Finance Committee determines to be appropriate to the role of the Association as an investor in such debentures and series A preferred stock.

(2) A copy of each affirmative finding, the reasons therefor, and each direction made by the Finance Committee under paragraph (1) of this subsection, together with the comments and recommendations thereon of the Board of Directors of the Association, shall be transmitted to the Congress by the Association within 10 days after the date on which the Finance Committee makes such finding and direction, or if not so transmitted, shall be transmitted by the Finance Committee. Each such direction so transmitted shall become finally effective and is required to be implemented by the Association, unless within the first period of 30 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date of its transmittal to Congress either House of Congress disapproves such direction (except that such direction shall become finally effective immediately upon approval of such direction by both Houses of Congress) in accordance with the procedures specified in section 688 of title 2 . For purposes of this paragraph, continuity of session of Congress is broken only in the circumstances described in section 682(5) of title 2 . During review by the Association and Congress, the Association shall take no action inconsistent with the direction of the Finance Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except to the extent the Association finds necessary, in its discretion, to assure continuous orderly operation of the Corporation.

(3) If the Congress, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, disapproves a direction submitted to the Association pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Association shall continue to purchase the debentures or series A preferred stock of the Corporation as otherwise provided in this subchapter until such time as a direction is submitted under this section which is not so disapproved (or affirmatively approved). The powers of the Association and of the Board of Directors of the Association shall remain in effect except to the extent modified by any such direction. If any such direction is disapproved by either House of Congress, the Finance Committee may, not earlier than 30 days after the date of such disapproval, make (and the Board of Directors of the Association shall transmit) any additional affirmative finding and direction with respect to the same matter, which direction shall become effective in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. An affirmative finding and direction under this subsection, or action by the Association during a review thereof by the Congress, may not be held unlawful or set aside by any reviewing court on the ground that such finding and direction or action were not adequate to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A), (E), or (F) of section 706(2) of title 5 .

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any terms and conditions governing its purchase of securities of the Corporation, the Association shall, upon written application by the Corporation at least 30 days prior to such investment, make an initial investment in debentures of the Corporation within 60 days after the date of conveyance of rail properties pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title . Such initial investment shall be limited to such amounts as the Association and Finance Committee, acting jointly, determine are necessary for the continued and orderly operations of the Corporation prior to any additional investment.

(5) Not later than 60 days after the date of conveyance pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title , the Association shall select 6 individuals to serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of section 741(d) of this title .
