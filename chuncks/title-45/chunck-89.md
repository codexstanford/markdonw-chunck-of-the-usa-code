### CHAPTER 9— RETIREMENT OF RAILROAD EMPLOYEES
#### § 231e. Lump sum payments
##### (c) Payments in the absence of further benefits

(1) Whenever it shall appear, with respect to the death of an employee, that no benefits, or no further benefits (other than benefits payable to a widow, widower, or parent under either this subchapter or the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] upon attaining the age of eligibility therefor at a future date) will be payable under this subchapter or under the Social Security Act, a lump sum in an amount computed under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be paid to such person or persons as the deceased employee may have designated by a writing filed with the Board prior to his or her death, or if there be no designation, to the following person (or, if more than one, in equal shares to the persons) whose relationship to the deceased employee will have been determined by the Board and who will not have died before receiving payment of the lump sum provided for in this subdivision

(i) the widow or widower of the deceased employee who was living with such employee at the time of such employee’s death; or

(ii) if there be no such widow or widower, to any child or children of such employee; or

(iii) if there be no such widow, widower, or child, to any grandchild or grandchildren of such employee; or

(iv) if there be no such widow, widower, child, or grandchild, to any parent or parents of such employee; or

(v) if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, or parent, to any brother or sister of such employee; or

(vi) if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, parent, brother, or sister, to the estate of such employee: Provided, however , That if the employee is survived by a widow, widower, or parent who may upon attaining the age of eligibility be entitled to benefits under this subchapter or under the Social Security Act, such lump sum shall not be paid unless such widow, widower, or parent makes and files with the Board an irrevocable election, in such form as the Board may prescribe, to have such lump sum be paid in lieu of all benefits to which such widow, widower, or parent might otherwise become entitled under this subchapter on the basis of the deceased employee’s compensation and years of service or under the Social Security Act on the basis of the deceased employee’s wages from (A) employment with an employer as defined in section 231(a) of this title or (B) service as an employee representative as defined in section 231(c) of this title . Any election made and filed by a widow, widower, or parent pursuant to this subdivision shall be legally effective according to its terms. After a lump sum with respect to the death of an employee is paid pursuant to an election filed with the Board under the provisions of this subsection, no further benefits shall be paid (other than to a survivor in the circumstances described in paragraph (3)) under this subchapter or the Social Security Act on the basis of such employee’s compensation and service under this subchapter, except that nothing in this subchapter or the Social Security Act shall operate to deprive a widow, widower, or parent making such election of any insurance benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] to which such individual would have been entitled if the employee had not rendered service as an employee under this subchapter.

(2) The lump sum provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be in an amount equal to (A) the sum of 4 per centum of the deceased employee’s compensation paid after December 31, 1936 , and prior to January 1, 1947 , plus 7 per centum of such employee’s compensation paid after December 31, 1946 , and before January 1, 1959 , plus 7½ per centum of such employee’s compensation paid after December 31, 1958 , and before January 1, 1962 , plus 8 per centum of such employee’s compensation paid after December 31, 1961 , and before January 1, 1966 , plus an amount equal to the total of all employee taxes payable by such employee after December 31, 1965 , and before January 1, 1975 , under the provisions of section 3201 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3201 ] (excluding, for this purpose, the amount of the employee tax attributable to that portion of the tax rate derived from section 3101(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [ 26 U.S.C. 3101(b) ]), plus one-half of 1 per centum of the compensation on which such taxes were payable, deeming the compensation attributable to creditable military service after June 30, 1963 , and before January 1, 1975 , to be taxable compensation, and one-half of the taxes payable by an employee representative under section 3211 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [ 26 U.S.C. 3211 ] to be employee taxes under section 3201 of such Act, minus (B) the sum of all benefits paid to such employee, and to others deriving from such employee, during his or her life, or to others by reason of his or her death, under this subchapter, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [ 45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.], or the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] (excluding, for this purpose, payments to providers of services under section 231f(d) of this title or section 21 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [ 45 U.S.C. 228s–2 ], any supplemental annuity payments made to the employee under section 231a(b) of this title or section 3(j) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [ 45 U.S.C. 228c(j) ], any amounts by which that portion of the annuities provided the employee under section 231b(a) of this title or his spouse or divorced wife under section 231c(a) of this title were increased by reason of the employee’s wages and self-employment income derived from employment and self-employment under the Social Security Act, that portion of the annuities provided the employee under section 231b(h) of this title or his spouse under section 231c(e) of this title , and so much of the benefits paid to the employee and to others deriving from him or her under the Social Security Act during his or her lifetime as would have been payable under that Act if such employee had not rendered service as an employee as defined in section 231(b) of this title ). In computing compensation for purposes of this subdivision there shall be excluded compensation in excess of $300 for any month before July 1, 1954 ; compensation in excess of $350 for any month after June 30, 1954 , and before June 1, 1959 ; compensation in excess of $400 for any month after May 31, 1959 , and before November 1, 1963 ; compensation in excess of $450 for any month after October 31, 1963 , and before October 1, 1965 ; and compensation in excess of (i) $450 or (ii) an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable “wages” as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [ 26 U.S.C. 3121 ], whichever is greater, for any month after September 30, 1965 .

(3) Notwithstanding the last sentence of paragraph (1), benefits shall be paid to a survivor who

(A) is a divorced wife; and

(B) through administrative error received benefits otherwise precluded by the making of a lump sum payment under this section to a widow; if that divorced wife makes an election to repay to the Board the lump sum payment. The Board may withhold up to 10 percent of each benefit amount paid after October 21, 1998 , toward such reimbursement. The Board may waive such repayment to the extent the Board determines it would cause an unjust financial hardship for the beneficiary.
