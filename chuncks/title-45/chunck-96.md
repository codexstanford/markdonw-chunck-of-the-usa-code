##### (d) Hospital insurance benefits; certified beneficiaries; disability insurance benefits; services in Canada; exchange of information

(1) The Board shall, for purposes of this subsection, have the same authority to determine the rights of individuals described in subdivision (2) to have payments made on their behalf for hospital insurance benefits consisting of inpatient hospital services, posthospital extended care services, home health services, hospice care, and outpatient hospital diagnostic services (all hereinafter referred to as “services”) under section 226 [ 42 U.S.C. 426 ], and parts A and E of title XVIII [ 42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq., 1395x et seq.], of the Social Security Act as the Secretary of Health and Human Services has under such section and such parts with respect to individuals to whom such sections and such parts apply. For purposes of section 231g of this title , a determination with respect to the rights of an individual under this subsection shall, except in the case of a provider of services, be considered to be a decision with respect to an annuity.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, every person who

(i) has attained age 65 and (A) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or (B) would be entitled to such an annuity had he ceased compensated service and, in the case of a spouse or divorced wife, had such spouse’s husband or wife ceased compensated service or (C) bears a relationship to an employee which, by reason of section 231b(f)(2) of this title , has been, or would be, taken into account in calculating the amount of the annuity of such employee; or

(ii) has not attained age 65 and (A) has been entitled to an annuity under section 231a of this title , or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [ 45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.] and section 231a of this title , or could have been includible in the computation of an annuity under section 231b(f)(2) of this title , for not less than 24 months and (B) could have been entitled for 24 calendar months, and could currently be entitled, to monthly insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 423 ] or under section 202 of that Act [ 42 U.S.C. 402 ] on the basis of disability if service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , had been included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act and if an application for disability benefits had been filed, shall be certified to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary under section 226 of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 426 ].

(3) If an individual entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of section 231a(a)(1) of this title would have been insured for disability insurance benefits as determined under section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 423(c)(1) ] at the time such annuity began, he shall be deemed, solely for purposes of paragraph (ii) of subdivision (2), to be entitled to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act for each month, and beginning with the first month, in which he would meet the requirements for entitlement to such a benefit, other than the requirement of being insured for disability insurance benefits, if service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and if an application for disability benefits had been filed.

(4) The rights of individuals described in subdivision (2) of this subsection to have payment made on their behalf for the services referred to in subdivision (1) but provided in Canada shall be the same as those of individuals to whom section 226 [ 42 U.S.C. 426 ] and part A of title XVIII [ 42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.] of the Social Security Act apply, and this subdivision shall be administered by the Board as if the provisions of section 226 and part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act were applicable, as if references to the Secretary of Health and Human Services were to the Board, as if references to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund were to the Railroad Retirement Account, as if references to the United States or a State included Canada or a subdivision thereof, and as if the provisions of sections 1862(a)(4), 1863, 1864, 1868, 1869, 1874(b), and 1875 [ 42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(4) , 1395z, 1395aa, 1395ee, 1395ff, 1395kk(b), 1395 ll ] were not included in such title. The payments for services herein provided for in Canada shall be made from the Railroad Retirement Account (in accordance with, and subject to, the conditions applicable under subsection (b), in making payment of other benefits) to the hospital, extended care facility, or home health agency providing such services in Canada to individuals to whom subdivision (2) of this subsection applies, but only to the extent that the amount of payments for services otherwise hereunder provided for an individual exceeds the amount payable for like services provided pursuant to the law in effect in the place in Canada where such services are furnished. For the purposes of section 231i of this title , any overpayment under this subdivision shall be treated as if it were an overpayment of an annuity.

(5) The Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish each other with such information, records, and documents as may be considered necessary to the administration of this subsection or section 226 [ 42 U.S.C. 426 ], and part A of title XVIII [ 42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.], of the Social Security Act.
