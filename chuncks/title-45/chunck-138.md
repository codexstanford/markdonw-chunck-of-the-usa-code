### CHAPTER 9— RETIREMENT OF RAILROAD EMPLOYEES
#### § 231u. Benefit preservation
###### (c) Not later than 180 days after the submission of a written report under subsection (a) of this section which states the first fiscal year during which benefits under this subchapter must be reduced because insufficient funds would preclude payment of full benefits for every month of that year, the Board shall issue and publish in the Federal Register such regulations as may be necessary which shall be designed to

(1) provide a constant level of benefits at the maximum level possible for every month of that fiscal year; and

(2) provide that no individual shall receive less during that fiscal year than the amount otherwise payable if the employee’s service as an employee after December 31, 1936 , had been covered under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], minus the amount of any reduction required under section 231b(m) or 231c(i) of this title. Unless otherwise provided by law enacted after August 13, 1981 , or by a later report filed by the Board under subsection (a) of this section, regulations issued by the Board under this subsection shall apply beginning with the fiscal year designated by the Board in its written report under subsection (a) of this section. Any Board regulation which becomes effective under this subsection may be modified, rescinded, or superseded in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other Board regulation issued under authority of this subchapter.
