#### § 231b. Computation of annuities
##### (g) Increased annuities under subsection (b)

(1) Effective with the date of any increase after January 31, 1984 , in monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] which occurs, or which would have occurred had there not been a general benefit increase under that Act, pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section 215(i) of that Act [ 42 U.S.C. 415(i) ], that portion of the annuity of an individual which is computed under subsection (b) of this section shall, if such individual’s annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue on or before the effective date of a particular increase under this subdivision, be increased by 32.5 per centum of the percentage increase in the index which is used, or which would have been used had there not been a general benefit increase under the Social Security Act, in increasing benefits under the Social Security Act pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section 215(i) of that Act. Any increase under this subsection shall not be deferred and shall be reflected in all payments made to annuitants after such increase under this subsection becomes effective.

(2) The first and, if necessary, the following time or times after January 1, 1983 , that monthly insurance benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 402 ] are increased, that portion of the annuity of an individual which is computed under subsection (b) of this section as increased under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall, if such individual’s annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue in or before the year in which such first increase under the Social Security Act [ 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] became effective, be reduced by the dollar amount by which that portion of the annuity provided such individual under subsection (a) of this section was increased, after any reduction under subsection (m) of this section, as a result of such increase or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the annuity amount provided such individual under subsection (a), as reduced under subsection (m), prior to such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.
