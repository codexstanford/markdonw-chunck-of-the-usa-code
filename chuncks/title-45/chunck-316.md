### CHAPTER 16— REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
#### § 721. Loans
##### (g) Pre-conveyance loans to Corporation

During the period between the effective date of the final system plan and the date of the conveyance of rail properties pursuant to section 743(b) of this title , the Association may make such loans in such amounts to the Corporation as the Association deems essential to provide for the purchase by the Corporation of material, supplies, equipment, and services necessary to permit the orderly and efficient implementation of the final system plan. Notwithstanding any inability of the Association during such period to make the finding required by subsection (e)(3) of this section because of any existing contingencies, the Association may make any such loans to the Corporation, subject to

(1) the most favorable terms and conditions for assuring timely repayment and security as may then be reasonably available, and

(2) the requirement that any loan to the Corporation under this subsection be refinanced immediately out of the proceeds of the first sale by the issuance of debentures under section 726 of this title . In order to assure that necessary funds are available to the Corporation for implementation of the final system plan, the Corporation is authorized to accept such loans as may be approved by the Association under this subsection, and any such acceptance shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute a reasonable and prudent business judgment in compliance with any fiduciary obligations imposed on the Corporation or its directors. For purposes of this subsection, the term “Corporation” includes a subsidiary of the Corporation.
