###### (b) 1975 Findings and Purpose.

(1) Findings .

Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes set out in subsection (a), especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975 , is assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia as of December 31, 1975 , has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region, and consistent with that goal, the Appalachian region should be able to take advantage of eco-industrial development, which promotes both employment and economic growth and the preservation of natural resources. Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs to the region and its people.

(2) Purpose .

It is also the purpose of this subtitle to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local efforts toward

(A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices;

(B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs; and

(C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation’s energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.
