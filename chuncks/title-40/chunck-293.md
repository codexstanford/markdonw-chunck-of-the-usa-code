(A) may assign space in the property to any federal agency;

(B) pending a sale, may lease the property for not more than 5 years and on terms the Administrator considers to be in the public interest; or

(C) may sell the property at public sale to the highest responsible bidder on terms and after public advertisement that the Administrator considers to be in the public interest.

(2) Review of decision to assign space .

If the federal agency to which space is assigned does not desire to occupy the space, the decision of the Administrator under paragraph (1)(A) is subject to review by the President.

(3) Negotiated sale .

If no bids which are satisfactory as to price and responsibility of the bidder are received as a result of public advertisement, the Administrator may sell the property by negotiation, on terms as may be considered to be to the best interest of the Government, but at a price not less than that bid by the highest responsible bidder.
