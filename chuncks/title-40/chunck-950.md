###### (a) Factors To Be Considered .

In considering programs and projects to be given assistance under this subtitle, and in establishing a priority ranking of the requests for assistance presented to the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Commission shall follow procedures that will ensure consideration of

(1) the relationship of the project or class of projects to overall regional development, including its location in a severely and persistently distressed county or area;

(2) the population and area to be served by the project or class of projects, including the per capita market income and the unemployment rates in the area;

(3) the relative financial resources available to the State or political subdivisions or instrumentalities of the State that seek to undertake the project;

(4) the importance of the project or class of projects in relation to other projects or classes of projects that may be in competition for the same amounts;

(5) the prospects that the project for which assistance is sought will improve, on a continuing rather than a temporary basis, the opportunities for employment, the average level of income, or the economic and social development of the area served by the project; and

(6) the extent to which the project design provides for detailed outcome measurements by which grant expenditures may be evaluated.
