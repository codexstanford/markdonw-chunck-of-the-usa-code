###### (a) Finding .

Congress finds that certain States and local communities of the region, including local development districts, may be unable to take maximum advantage of Federal grant programs for which the States and communities are eligible because

(1) they lack the economic resources to provide the required matching share; or

(2) there are insufficient funds available under the applicable Federal law with respect to a project to be carried out in the region.
