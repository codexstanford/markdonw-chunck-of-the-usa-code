#### § 8907. Temporary site designation
###### (a) Criterion for Designation .

If the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the National Capital Memorial Commission, determines that a site where commemorative works may be displayed on a temporary basis is necessary to aid in the preservation of the limited amount of open space available to residents of, and visitors to, the Nation’s Capital, a site may be designated on land the Secretary administers in the District of Columbia.
