#### § 586. Charges for space and services
###### (b) Charges by Administrator of General Services.

(1) In general .

The Administrator of General Services shall impose a charge for furnishing space and services.

(2) Rates .

The Administrator shall, from time to time, determine the rates to be charged for furnishing space and services and shall prescribe regulations providing for the rates. The rates shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. However, for a building for which the Administrator is responsible for alterations only (as the term “alter” is defined in section 3301(a) of this title ), the rates shall be fixed to recover only the approximate cost incurred in providing alterations.

(3) Exemptions .

The Administrator may exempt anyone from the charges required by this subsection when the Administrator determines that charges would be infeasible or impractical. To the extent an exemption is granted, appropriations to the General Services Administration are authorized to reimburse the Federal Buildings Fund for any loss of revenue.
