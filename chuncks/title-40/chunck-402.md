#### § 3177. Use of photovoltaic energy in public buildings
###### (a) Photovoltaic Energy Commercialization Program.

(1) In general .

The Administrator of General Services may establish a photovoltaic energy commercialization program for the procurement and installation of photovoltaic solar electric systems for electric production in new and existing public buildings.

(2) Purposes .

The purposes of the program shall be to accomplish the following:

(A) To accelerate the growth of a commercially viable photovoltaic industry to make this energy system available to the general public as an option which can reduce the national consumption of fossil fuel.

(B) To reduce the fossil fuel consumption and costs of the Federal Government.

(C) To attain the goal of installing solar energy systems in 20,000 Federal buildings by 2010, as contained in the Federal Government’s Million Solar Roof Initiative of 1997.

(D) To stimulate the general use within the Federal Government of life-cycle costing and innovative procurement methods.

(E) To develop program performance data to support policy decisions on future incentive programs with respect to energy.

(3) Acquisition of photovoltaic solar electric systems.

(A) In general .

The program shall provide for the acquisition of photovoltaic solar electric systems and associated storage capability for use in public buildings.

(B) Acquisition levels .

The acquisition of photovoltaic electric systems shall be at a level substantial enough to allow use of low-cost production techniques with at least 150 megawatts (peak) cumulative acquired during the 5 years of the program.

(4) Administration .

The Administrator shall administer the program and shall

(A) issue such rules and regulations as may be appropriate to monitor and assess the performance and operation of photovoltaic solar electric systems installed pursuant to this subsection;

(B) develop innovative procurement strategies for the acquisition of such systems; and

(C) transmit to Congress an annual report on the results of the program.
