###### (c) Forfeited Property.

(1) Agency retains property .

An agency that seizes property that has been forfeited to the Government other than by court decree may retain the property and devote it only to official use instead of disposing of the property as otherwise provided by law if competent authority does not order the property returned to any claimant.

(2) Agency does not desire to retain property .

If the agency does not desire to retain the property, the head of the agency immediately shall notify the Administrator to that effect, and the property

(A) if not ordered by competent authority to be returned to any claimant, or disposed of as otherwise provided by law, shall be delivered by the agency, on order of the Administrator given within a reasonable time, to another agency that requests the property and that the Administrator believes should be given the property; or

(B) on order of the Administrator given within a reasonable time, shall be disposed of as otherwise provided by law.
