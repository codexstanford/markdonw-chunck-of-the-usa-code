(C) may be designed and conducted in coordination with a comprehensive system for evaluating medical device technology that operates under a governing board with appropriate representation of stakeholders, including patient groups and device manufacturers;

(D) use electronic health data including claims data, patient survey data, or any other data, as the Secretary determines appropriate; and

(E) prioritize devices and device types that meet one or more of the following criteria:

(i) Devices and device types for which the collection and analysis of real world evidence regarding a device’s safety and effectiveness is likely to advance public health.

(ii) Devices and device types that are widely used.

(iii) Devices and device types, the failure of which has significant health consequences.

(iv) Devices and device types for which the Secretary

(I) has received public recommendations in accordance with paragraph (2)(B); and
