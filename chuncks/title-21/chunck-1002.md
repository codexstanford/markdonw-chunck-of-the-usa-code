### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360bbb–8d. Notification, nondistribution, and recall of controlled substances
##### (a) Order to cease distribution and recall

(1) In general

If the Secretary determines there is a reasonable probability that a controlled substance would cause serious adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary may, after providing the appropriate person with an opportunity to consult with the agency, issue an order requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors, or pharmacists, who distribute such controlled substance to immediately cease distribution of such controlled substance.

(2) Hearing

An order under paragraph (1) shall provide the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the date of issuance of the order, on whether adequate evidence exists to justify an amendment to the order, and what actions are required by such amended order pursuant to subparagraph (3).

(3) Order resolution

After an order is issued according to the process under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall, except as provided in paragraph (4)

(A) vacate the order, if the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the actions required by the order;

(B) continue the order ceasing distribution of the controlled substance until a date specified in such order; or

(C) amend the order to require a recall of the controlled substance, including any requirements to notify appropriate persons, a timetable for the recall to occur, and a schedule for updates to be provided to the Secretary regarding such recall.

(4) Risk assessment

If the Secretary determines that the risk of recalling a controlled substance presents a greater health risk than the health risk of not recalling such controlled substance from use, an amended order under subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) shall not include either a recall order for, or an order to cease distribution of, such controlled substance, as applicable.

(5) Action following order

Any person who is subject to an order pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3) shall immediately cease distribution of or recall, as applicable, the controlled substance and provide notification as required by such order.
