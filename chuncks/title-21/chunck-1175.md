### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 379h. Authority to assess and use drug fees
##### (d) Fee waiver or reduction

(1) In general

The Secretary shall grant to a person who is named as the applicant in a human drug application a waiver from or a reduction of one or more fees assessed to that person under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that

(A) such waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health,

(B) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other circumstances, or

(C) the applicant involved is a small business submitting its first human drug application to the Secretary for review.

(2) Considerations

In determining whether to grant a waiver or reduction of a fee under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider only the circumstances and assets of the applicant involved and any affiliate of the applicant.

(3) Rules relating to small businesses

(A) “Small business” defined

In paragraph (1)(C), the term “small business” means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, and that does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.

(B) Waiver of application fee

The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(C) the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent human drug applications submitted to the Secretary for review in the same manner as an entity that does not qualify as a small business.
