### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360a–2. Susceptibility test interpretive criteria for microorganisms
##### (b) Susceptibility test Interpretive Criteria Website

(1) In general

Not later than 1 year after December 13, 2016 , the Secretary shall establish, and maintain thereafter, on the website of the Food and Drug Administration, a dedicated website that contains a list of any appropriate new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards and interpretive criteria in accordance with paragraph (2) (referred to in this section as the “Interpretive Criteria Website”).

(2) Listing of susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards and interpretive criteria

(A) In general

The list described in paragraph (1) shall consist of any new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards that are

(i) established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization that

(I) establishes and maintains procedures to address potential conflicts of interest and ensure transparent decisionmaking;

(II) holds open meetings to ensure that there is an opportunity for public input by interested parties, and establishes and maintains processes to ensure that such input is considered in decisionmaking; and

(III) permits its standards to be made publicly available, through the National Library of Medicine or another similar source acceptable to the Secretary; and

(ii) recognized in whole, or in part, by the Secretary under subsection (c).

(B) Other list

The Interpretive Criteria Website shall, in addition to the list described in subparagraph (A), include a list of interpretive criteria, if any, that the Secretary has determined to be appropriate with respect to legally marketed antimicrobial drugs, where

(i) the Secretary does not recognize, in whole or in part, an interpretive criteria standard described under subparagraph (A) otherwise applicable to such a drug;

(ii) the Secretary withdraws under subsection (c)(1)(A) recognition of a standard, in whole or in part, otherwise applicable to such a drug;

(iii) the Secretary approves an application under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42 , as applicable, with respect to marketing of such a drug for which there are no relevant interpretive criteria included in a standard recognized by the Secretary under subsection (c); or

(iv) because the characteristics of such a drug differ from other drugs with the same active ingredient, the interpretive criteria with respect to such drug

(I) differ from otherwise applicable interpretive criteria included in a standard listed under subparagraph (A) or interpretive criteria otherwise listed under this subparagraph; and

(II) are determined by the Secretary to be appropriate for the drug.

(C) Required statements

The Interpretive Criteria Website shall include statements conveying

(i) that the website provides information about the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms, as applicable to a certain drug (or drugs);

(ii) that

(I) the safety and efficacy of such drugs in treating clinical infections due to such bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms, as applicable, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in order for the susceptibility information described in clause (i) to be included on the website; and

(II) the clinical significance of such susceptibility information in such instances is unknown;

(iii) that the approved product labeling for specific drugs provides the uses for which the Secretary has approved the product; and

(iv) any other information that the Secretary determines appropriate to adequately convey the meaning of the data supporting the recognition or listing of susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards or susceptibility test interpretive criteria included on the website.

(3) Notice

Not later than the date on which the Interpretive Criteria Website is established, the Secretary shall publish a notice of that establishment in the Federal Register.

(4) Inapplicability of misbranding provision

The inclusion in the approved labeling of an antimicrobial drug of a reference or hyperlink to the Interpretive Criteria Website, in and of itself, shall not cause the drug to be misbranded in violation of section 352 of this title .

(5) Trade secrets and confidential information

Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to disclose any information that is a trade secret or confidential information subject to section 552(b)(4) of title 5 .
