#### § 360ccc–2. Designated new animal drugs for minor use or minor species
##### (c) Exclusivity for designated new animal drugs

(1) Except as provided in subsection (c)(2), if the Secretary approves or conditionally approves an application for a designated new animal drug, the Secretary may not approve or conditionally approve another application submitted for such new animal drug with the same intended use as the designated new animal drug for another applicant before the expiration of seven years from the date of approval or conditional approval of the application.

(2) If an application filed pursuant to section 360b of this title or section 360ccc of this title is approved for a designated new animal drug, the Secretary may, during the 7-year exclusivity period beginning on the date of the application approval or conditional approval, approve or conditionally approve another application under section 360b of this title or section 360ccc of this title for such drug for such minor use or minor species for another applicant if

(B) such holder provides written consent to the Secretary for the approval or conditional approval of other applications before the expiration of such exclusivity period.
