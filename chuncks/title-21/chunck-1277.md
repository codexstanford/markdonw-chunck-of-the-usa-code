### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 379j–52. Authority to assess and use biosimilar biological product fees
##### (d) Application fee waiver for small business

(1) Waiver of application fee

The Secretary shall grant to a person who is named in a biosimilar biological product application a waiver from the application fee assessed to that person under subsection (a)(2)(A) for the first biosimilar biological product application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent biosimilar biological product applications submitted to the Secretary for review in the same manner as an entity that is not a small business.

(2) Considerations

In determining whether to grant a waiver of a fee under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider only the circumstances and assets of the applicant involved and any affiliate of the applicant.

(3) Small business defined

In this subsection, the term “small business” means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, and does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application (as defined in section 379g of this title ) or a biosimilar biological product application (as defined in section 379j–51(4) of this title ) and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.
