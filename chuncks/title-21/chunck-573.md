### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 356. Expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions
##### (e) Construction

(1) Purpose

The amendments made by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act and the 21st Century Cures Act to this section are intended to encourage the Secretary to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval for treatments for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and unmet medical needs.

(2) Construction

Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the standards of evidence under subsection (c) or (d) of section 355 of this title (including the substantial evidence standard in section 355(d) of this title ) or under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 262(a) ]. Such sections and standards of evidence apply to the review and approval of products under this section, including whether a product is safe and effective. Nothing in this section alters the ability of the Secretary to rely on evidence that does not come from adequate and well-controlled investigations for the purpose of determining whether an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit as described in subsection (b)(1)(B).
