##### (c) Recognition of susceptibility test interpretive criteria

(1) Evaluation and publication

(A) In general

Beginning on the date of the establishment of the Interpretive Criteria Website, and at least every 6 months thereafter, the Secretary shall

(i) evaluate any appropriate new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization described in subsection (b)(2)(A)(i); and

(ii) publish on the public website of the Food and Drug Administration a notice

(I) withdrawing recognition of any different susceptibility test interpretive criteria standard, in whole or in part;

(II) recognizing the new or updated standards;

(III) recognizing one or more parts of the new or updated interpretive criteria specified in such a standard and declining to recognize the remainder of such standard; and

(IV) making any necessary updates to the lists under subsection (b)(2).

(B) Upon approval of a drug

Upon the approval of an initial or supplemental application for an antimicrobial drug under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42 , as applicable, where such approval is based on susceptibility test interpretive criteria which differ from those contained in a standard recognized, or from those otherwise listed, by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection, or for which there are no relevant interpretive criteria standards recognized, or interpretive criteria otherwise listed, by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall update the lists under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (b)(2) to include the susceptibility test interpretive criteria upon which such approval was based.

(2) Bases for updating interpretive criteria standards

In evaluating new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may consider

(A) the Secretary’s determination that such a standard is not applicable to a particular drug because the characteristics of the drug differ from other drugs with the same active ingredient;

(B) information provided by interested third parties, including public comment on the annual compilation of notices published under paragraph (3);

(C) any bases used to identify susceptibility test interpretive criteria under subsection (a)(2); and

(D) such other information or factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.

(3) Annual compilation of notices

Each year, the Secretary shall compile the notices published under paragraph (1)(A) and publish such compilation in the Federal Register and provide for public comment. If the Secretary receives comments, the Secretary shall review such comments and, if the Secretary determines appropriate, update pursuant to this subsection susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards or criteria

(A) recognized by the Secretary under this subsection; or

(B) otherwise listed on the Interpretive Criteria Website under subsection (b)(2).

(4) Relation to section 360d(c) of this title

Any susceptibility test interpretive standard recognized under this subsection or any criteria otherwise listed under subsection (b)(2)(B) shall be deemed to be recognized as a standard by the Secretary under section 360d(c)(1) of this title .

(5) Voluntary use of interpretive criteria

Nothing in this section prohibits a person from seeking approval or clearance of a drug or device, or changes to the drug or the device, on the basis of susceptibility test interpretive criteria which differ from those contained in a standard recognized, or from those otherwise listed, by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b)(2).
