#### § 353d. Process to update labeling for certain generic drugs
##### (f) Review of application holder’s response

(1) In general

Upon receipt of the application holder’s response, the Secretary shall promptly review each statement received under subsection (e)(2) and determine which labeling changes pursuant to the Secretary’s notice under subsection (d) are appropriate, if any. If the Secretary disagrees with the reasons why such labeling changes are not warranted, the Secretary shall provide opportunity for discussions with the application holders to reach agreement on whether the labeling for the covered drug should be updated to reflect available scientific evidence, and if so, the content of such labeling changes.

(2) Changes to labeling

After considering all responses from the holder of an approved application under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e), and any discussion under paragraph (1), the Secretary may order such holder to make the labeling changes the Secretary determines are appropriate. Such holder of an approved application shall

(A) update its paper labeling for the drug at the next printing of that labeling;

(B) update any electronic labeling for the drug within 30 days of such order; and

(C) submit the revised labeling through the form, “Supplement—Changes Being Effected”.
