### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 387f. General provisions respecting control of tobacco products
##### (d) Restrictions

(1) In general

The Secretary may by regulation require restrictions on the sale and distribution of a tobacco product, including restrictions on the access to, and the advertising and promotion of, the tobacco product, if the Secretary determines that such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. The Secretary may by regulation impose restrictions on the advertising and promotion of a tobacco product consistent with and to full extent permitted by the first amendment to the Constitution. The finding as to whether such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the public health shall be determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product, and taking into account

(A) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products; and

(B) the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products. No such regulation may require that the sale or distribution of a tobacco product be limited to the written or oral authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to prescribe medical products.

(2) Label statements

The label of a tobacco product shall bear such appropriate statements of the restrictions required by a regulation under subsection (a) as the Secretary may in such regulation prescribe.

(3) Limitations

(A) In general

No restrictions under paragraph (1) may

(i) prohibit the sale of any tobacco product in face-to-face transactions by a specific category of retail outlets; or

(ii) establish a minimum age of sale of tobacco products to any person older than 21 years of age.

(B) Matchbooks

For purposes of any regulations issued by the Secretary, matchbooks of conventional size containing not more than 20 paper matches, and which are customarily given away for free with the purchase of tobacco products, shall be considered as adult-written publications which shall be permitted to contain advertising. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Secretary finds that such treatment of matchbooks is not appropriate for the protection of the public health, the Secretary may determine by regulation that matchbooks shall not be considered adult-written publications.

(4) Remote sales

(A) In general

The Secretary shall

(i) within 18 months after June 22, 2009 , promulgate regulations regarding the sale and distribution of tobacco products that occur through means other than a direct, face-to-face exchange between a retailer and a consumer in order to prevent the sale and distribution of tobacco products to individuals who have not attained the minimum age established by applicable law for the purchase of such products, including requirements for age verification; and

(ii) within 2 years after June 22, 2009 , issue regulations to address the promotion and marketing of tobacco products that are sold or distributed through means other than a direct, face-to-face exchange between a retailer and a consumer in order to protect individuals who have not attained the minimum age established by applicable law for the purchase of such products.

(B) Relation to other authority

Nothing in this paragraph limits the authority of the Secretary to take additional actions under the other paragraphs of this subsection.

(5) Minimum age of sale

It shall be unlawful for any retailer to sell a tobacco product to any person younger than 21 years of age.
