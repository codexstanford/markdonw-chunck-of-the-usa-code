(C) Base inflation adjustment

(i) In general

Subject to further adjustment under clause (ii), the base inflation adjustment for a fiscal year is the sum of one plus

(I) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years, multiplied by 0.60; and
