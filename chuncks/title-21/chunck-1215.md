##### (d) Fee waiver or reduction; exemptions from fees

(1) Waiver or reduction

The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of one or more fees assessed under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that

(A) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other circumstances;

(B) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the anticipated present and future costs incurred by the Secretary in conducting the process for the review of animal drug applications for such person;

(C) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application is intended solely to provide for use of the animal drug in

(i) a Type B medicated feed (as defined in section 558.3(b)(3) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation)) intended for use in the manufacture of Type C free-choice medicated feeds; or

(ii) a Type C free-choice medicated feed (as defined in section 558.3(b)(4) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation));

(D) the animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application is intended solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication; or

(E) the sponsor involved is a small business submitting its first animal drug application to the Secretary for review.

(2) Use of standard costs

In making the finding in paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary may use standard costs.

(3) Rules for small businesses

In paragraph (1)(E), the term “small business” means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates.

(B) Waiver of application fee

The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(E) the application fee for the first animal drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent animal drug applications and supplemental animal drug applications for which safety or effectiveness data are required in the same manner as an entity that does not qualify as a small business.

(C) Certification

(4) Exemptions from fees

Fees under this section shall not apply with respect to any person who

(i) not later than September 30, 2023 , submits a supplemental animal drug application relating to a new animal drug application approved under section 360b of this title , solely to add the new animal drug application number to the labeling of the drug in the manner specified in section 352(w)(3) of this title ; and

(ii) otherwise would be subject to fees under this section solely on the basis of such supplemental application.

(B) Certain animal drug applications

Fees under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any person who is the named applicant or sponsor of an animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or investigational animal drug submission if such application or submission involves the intentional genomic alteration of an animal that is intended to produce a drug, device, or biological product subject to fees under section 379h, 379j, 379j–42, or 379j–52 of this title.
