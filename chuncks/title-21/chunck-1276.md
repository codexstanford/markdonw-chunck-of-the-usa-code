### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 379j–52. Authority to assess and use biosimilar biological product fees
##### (c) Adjustments; annual fee setting

(1) Inflation adjustment

(A) In general

For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B), the dollar amount of the inflation adjustment to the annual base revenue for each fiscal year shall be equal to the product of

(i) such annual base revenue for the fiscal year under subsection (b)(1)(A); and

(ii) the inflation adjustment percentage under subparagraph (B).

(B) Inflation adjustment percentage

The inflation adjustment percentage under this subparagraph for a fiscal year is equal to the sum of

(i) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years, multiplied by the proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications (as defined in section 379j–51(13) of this title ) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years; and

(ii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV; Not Seasonally Adjusted; All items; Annual Index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years of available data multiplied by the proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications (as defined in section 379j–51(13) of this title ) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years.

(2) Strategic hiring and retention adjustment

For each fiscal year, after the annual base revenue under subsection (b)(1)(A) is adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1), the Secretary shall further increase the fee revenue and fees by $150,000.

(3) Capacity planning adjustment

(A) In general

For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall, in addition to the adjustments under paragraphs (1) and (2), further adjust the fee revenue and fees under this section for a fiscal year to reflect changes in the resource capacity needs of the Secretary for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.

(B) Methodology

For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall employ the capacity planning methodology utilized by the Secretary in setting fees for fiscal year 2021, as described in the notice titled “Biosimilar User Fee Rates for Fiscal Year 2021” published in the Federal Register on August 4, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 47220). The workload categories used in applying such methodology in forecasting shall include only the activities described in that notice and, as feasible, additional activities that are directly related to the direct review of biosimilar biological product applications and supplements, including additional formal meeting types, the direct review of postmarketing commitments and requirements, the direct review of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and the direct review of annual reports for approved biosimilar biological products. Subject to the exceptions in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall not include as workload categories in applying such methodology in forecasting any non-core review activities, including those activities that the Secretary referenced for potential future use in such notice but did not utilize in setting fees for fiscal year 2021.

(C) Limitations

Under no circumstances shall an adjustment under this paragraph result in fee revenue for a fiscal year that is less than the sum of the amounts under subsections (b)(1)(A) (the annual base revenue for the fiscal year), (b)(1)(B) (the dollar amount of the inflation adjustment for the fiscal year), and (b)(1)(C) (the dollar amount of the strategic hiring and retention adjustment).

(D) Publication in Federal Register

The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice under paragraph (5) the fee revenue and fees resulting from the adjustment and the methodologies under this paragraph.

(4) Operating reserve adjustment

(A) Increase

For fiscal year 2023 and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall, in addition to adjustments under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), further increase the fee revenue and fees if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for at least 10 weeks of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.

(B) Decrease

(i) Fiscal year 2023

For fiscal year 2023, if the Secretary has carryover balances for such process in excess of 33 weeks of such operating reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee revenue and fees to provide for not more than 33 weeks of such operating reserves.

(ii) Fiscal year 2024

For fiscal year 2024, if the Secretary has carryover balances for such process in excess of 27 weeks of such operating reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee revenue and fees to provide for not more than 27 weeks of such operating reserves.

(iii) Fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fiscal years

For fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fiscal years, if the Secretary has carryover balances for such process in excess of 21 weeks of such operating reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee revenue and fees to provide for not more than 21 weeks of such operating reserves.

(C) Federal Register notice

If an adjustment under subparagraph (A) or (B) is made, the rationale for the amount of the increase or decrease (as applicable) in fee revenue and fees shall be contained in the annual Federal Register notice under paragraph (5)(B) establishing fee revenue and fees for the fiscal year involved.

(5) Annual fee setting

For fiscal year 2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days before the start of each such fiscal year

(A) establish, for the fiscal year, initial and annual biosimilar biological product development fees and reactivation fees under subsection (a)(1), biosimilar biological product application fees under subsection (a)(2), and biosimilar biological product program fees under subsection (a)(3), based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and the adjustments provided under this subsection; and

(B) publish such fee revenue and fees in the Federal Register.

(6) Limit

The total amount of fees assessed for a fiscal year under this section may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.
