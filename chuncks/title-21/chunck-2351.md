#### § 1706. High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program
##### (e) Organization of high intensity drug trafficking areas

(1) Executive Board and officers

To be eligible for funds appropriated under this section, each high intensity drug trafficking area shall be governed by an Executive Board. The Executive Board shall designate a chairman, vice chairman, and any other officers to the Executive Board that it determines are necessary.

(2) Responsibilities

The Executive Board of a high intensity drug trafficking area shall be responsible for

(A) providing direction and oversight in establishing and achieving the goals of the high intensity drug trafficking area;

(B) managing the funds of the high intensity drug trafficking area;

(C) reviewing and approving all funding proposals consistent with the overall objective of the high intensity drug trafficking area; and

(D) reviewing and approving all reports to the Director on the activities of the high intensity drug trafficking area.

(3) Board representation

None of the funds appropriated under this section may be expended for any high intensity drug trafficking area, or for a partnership or region of a high intensity drug trafficking area, if the Executive Board for such area, region, or partnership, does not apportion an equal number of votes between representatives of participating Federal agencies and representatives of participating State, local, and tribal agencies. Where it is impractical for an equal number of representatives of Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal agencies to attend a meeting of an Executive Board in person, the Executive Board may use a system of proxy votes or weighted votes to achieve the voting balance required by this paragraph.

(4) No agency relationship

The eligibility requirements of this section are intended to ensure the responsible use of Federal funds. Nothing in this section is intended to create an agency relationship between individual high intensity drug trafficking areas and the Federal Government.
