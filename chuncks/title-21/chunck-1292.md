##### (c) Amount of establishment fee and reinspection fee

(1) In general

For each outsourcing facility in a fiscal year

(A) except as provided in paragraph (4), the amount of the annual establishment fee under subsection (b) shall be equal to the sum of

(i) $15,000, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor described in paragraph (2); plus

(ii) the small business adjustment factor described in paragraph (3); and

(B) the amount of any reinspection fee (if applicable) under subsection (b) shall be equal to $15,000, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor described in paragraph (2).

(2) Inflation adjustment factor

(A) In general

For fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal years, the fee amounts established in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year by the amount equal to the sum of

(i) 1;

(ii) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years, multiplied by the proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of an average full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years; plus

(iii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (U.S. City Average; Not Seasonally Adjusted; All items; Annual Index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years of available data multiplied by the proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of an average full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years.

(B) Compounded basis

The adjustment made each fiscal year under subparagraph (A) shall be added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2014 under subparagraph (A).

(3) Small business adjustment factor

The small business adjustment factor described in this paragraph shall be an amount established by the Secretary for each fiscal year based on the Secretary’s estimate of

(A) the number of small businesses that will pay a reduced establishment fee for such fiscal year; and

(B) the adjustment to the establishment fee necessary to achieve total fees equaling the total fees that the Secretary would have collected if no entity qualified for the small business exception in paragraph (4).

(4) Exception for small businesses

(A) In general

In the case of an outsourcing facility with gross annual sales of $1,000,000 or less in the 12 months ending April 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the fees under this section are assessed, the amount of the establishment fee under subsection (b) for a fiscal year shall be equal to \1/3\ of the amount calculated under paragraph (1)(A)(i) for such fiscal year.

(B) Application

To qualify for the exception under this paragraph, a small business shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such exception, in a format specified by the Secretary in guidance, certifying its gross annual sales for the 12 months ending April 1 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which fees under this subsection are assessed. Any such application shall be submitted to the Secretary not later than April 30 of such immediately preceding fiscal year.

(5) Crediting of fees

In establishing the small business adjustment factor under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall

(A) provide for the crediting of fees from the previous year to the next year if the Secretary overestimated the amount of the small business adjustment factor for such previous fiscal year; and

(B) consider the need to account for any adjustment of fees and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.
