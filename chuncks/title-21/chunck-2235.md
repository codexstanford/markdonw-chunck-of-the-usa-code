##### (a) Scope of programs; priority

The Secretary  1 acting through the National Institute on Drug Abuse, may make grants to and enter into contracts with individuals and public and private nonprofit entities

(1) to provide training seminars, educational programs, and technical assistance for the development, demonstration, and evaluation of drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs; and

(2) to conduct demonstration and evaluation projects, with a high priority on prevention and early intervention projects and on identifying new and more effective drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. In the implementation of his authority under this section, the Secretary shall accord a high priority to applications for grants or contracts for primary prevention programs. For purposes of the preceding sentence, primary prevention programs include programs designed to discourage persons from beginning drug abuse. To the extent that appropriations authorized under this section are used to fund treatment services, the Secretary shall not limit such funding to treatment for opiate abuse, but shall also provide support for treatment for non-opiate drug abuse including polydrug abuse. Furthermore, nothing shall prevent the use of funds provided under this section for programs and projects aimed at the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of alcohol abuse and alcoholism as well as drug abuse.
