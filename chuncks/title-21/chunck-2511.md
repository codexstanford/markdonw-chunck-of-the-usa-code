(2) it is imperative that the People’s Republic of China follow through on full implementation of the new regulations, adopted May 1, 2019 , to treat all fentanyl analogues as controlled substances under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, including by devoting sufficient resources for implementation and strict enforcement of the new regulations; and

(3) the effective enforcement of the new regulations should result in diminished trafficking of illicit fentanyl originating from the People’s Republic of China into the United States.
