### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 355h. Regulation of certain nonprescription drugs that are marketed without an approved drug application
##### (c) Procedure for minor changes

(1) In general

Minor changes in the dosage form of a drug that is described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) or the subject of an order issued under subsection (b) may be made by a requestor without the issuance of an order under subsection (b) if

(A) the requestor maintains such information as is necessary to demonstrate that the change

(i) will not affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug; and

(ii) will not materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to the active ingredient in comparison to a suitable reference product; and

(B) the change is in conformity with the requirements of an applicable administrative order issued by the Secretary under paragraph (3).

(2) Additional information

(A) Access to records

A sponsor shall submit records requested by the Secretary relating to such a minor change under section 374(a)(4) of this title , within 15 business days of receiving such a request, or such longer period as the Secretary may provide.

(B) Insufficient information

If the Secretary determines that the information contained in such records is not sufficient to demonstrate that the change does not affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug or materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to the active ingredient, the Secretary

(i) may so inform the sponsor of the drug in writing; and

(ii) if the Secretary so informs the sponsor, shall provide the sponsor of the drug with a reasonable opportunity to provide additional information.

(C) Failure to submit sufficient information

If the sponsor fails to provide such additional information within a time prescribed by the Secretary, or if the Secretary determines that such additional information does not demonstrate that the change does not

(i) affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug; or

(ii) materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to the active ingredient in comparison to a suitable reference product, the drug as modified is a new drug under section 321(p) of this title and shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 352(ee) of this title .

(3) Determining whether a change will affect safety or effectiveness

(A) In general

The Secretary shall issue one or more administrative orders specifying requirements for determining whether a minor change made by a sponsor pursuant to this subsection will affect the safety or effectiveness of a drug or materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to an active ingredient in the drug in comparison to a suitable reference product, together with guidance for applying those orders to specific dosage forms.

(B) Standard practices

The orders and guidance issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall take into account relevant public standards and standard practices for evaluating the quality of drugs, and may take into account the special needs of populations, including children.
