### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360ccc. Conditional approval of new animal drugs for minor use and minor species and certain new animal drugs
##### (h) Order of approval after conditional approval period termination

180 days prior to the termination date established under subsection (d) of this section, an applicant shall have submitted all the information necessary to support a complete new animal drug application in accordance with section 360b(b)(1) of this title or the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in effect. Following review of this information, the Secretary shall either

(1) issue an order approving the application under section 360b(c) of this title if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds for denying approval specified in section 360b(d)(1) of this title applies, or

(2) give the applicant an opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary under section 360b(d) of this title on the question whether such application can be approved. Upon issuance of an order approving the application, product labeling and administrative records of approval shall be modified accordingly. If the Secretary has not issued an order under section 360b(c) of this title approving such application prior to the termination date established under subsection (d) of this section, the conditional approval issued under this section is no longer in effect unless the Secretary grants an extension of an additional 180-day period so that the Secretary can complete review of the application. The decision to grant an extension is committed to the discretion of the Secretary and not subject to judicial review.
