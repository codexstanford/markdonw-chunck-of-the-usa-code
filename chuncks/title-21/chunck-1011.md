### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360ccc. Conditional approval of new animal drugs for minor use and minor species and certain new animal drugs
##### (d) Effective period; renewal; refusal of renewal

A conditional approval under this section is effective for a 1-year period and is thereafter renewable by the Secretary annually for up to 4 additional 1-year terms. A conditional approval shall be in effect for no more than 5 years from the date of approval under subsection (b)(1) or (c) of this section unless extended as provided for in subsection (h) of this section. The following shall also apply:

(1) No later than 90 days from the end of the 1-year period for which the original or renewed conditional approval is effective, the applicant may submit a request to renew a conditional approval for an additional 1-year term.

(2) A conditional approval shall be deemed renewed at the end of the 1-year period, or at the end of a 90-day extension that the Secretary may, at the Secretary’s discretion, grant by letter in order to complete review of the renewal request, unless the Secretary determines before the expiration of the 1-year period or the 90-day extension that

(A) the applicant failed to submit a timely renewal request;

(B) the request fails to contain sufficient information to show that

(i) the applicant is making sufficient progress toward meeting approval requirements under section 360b(d)(1)(E) of this title , and is likely to be able to fulfill those requirements and obtain an approval under section 360b of this title before the expiration of the 5-year maximum term of the conditional approval;

(ii) the quantity of the drug that has been distributed is consistent with the conditionally approved intended use and conditions of use, unless there is adequate explanation that ensures that the drug is only used for its intended purpose; or

(iii) the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use has not received approval under section 360b of this title , or if such a drug has been approved, that the holder of the approved application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended; or

(C) any of the provisions of section 360b(e)(1)(A) through (B) or (D) through (F) of this title are applicable.

(3) If the Secretary determines before the end of the 1-year period or the 90-day extension, if granted, that a conditional approval should not be renewed, the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to renew the conditional approval, and such conditional approval shall be deemed withdrawn and no longer in effect. The Secretary shall thereafter provide an opportunity for an informal hearing to the applicant on the issue whether the conditional approval shall be reinstated.

(4)

(A) In the case of an application under subsection (a) with respect to a drug for which the Secretary provides notice to the sponsor that the Secretary intends to issue a scientific and medical evaluation and recommend controls under the Controlled Substances Act [ 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], conditional approval of such application shall not take effect until the interim final rule controlling the drug is issued in accordance with section 201(j) of the Controlled Substances Act [ 21 U.S.C. 811(j) ].

(B) For purposes of this section, with respect to an application described in subparagraph (A), the term “date of approval” shall mean the later of

(i) the date an application under subsection (a) is conditionally approved under subsection (b); or

(ii) the date of issuance of the interim final rule controlling the drug.
