(B) Issues of material fact

With respect to a finding made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence submitted by the claimant would be sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the jury found the evidence to be credible.

If, under applicable rules, the court permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment governed by section 1604(d) of this title , such discovery shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the applicable elements set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1604(d) of this title .

(3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier

A biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section 1604(d) of this title or the failure to establish the applicable elements of section 1604(d) of this title solely to the extent permitted by the applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against nonparties.
