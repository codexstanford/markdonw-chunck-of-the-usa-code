(C) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review;

(D) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor;

(F) applying any applicable Food and Drug Administration program intended to expedite the development and review of a medical product; and

(G) in appropriate circumstances, permitting expanded access to the medical product during the investigational phase, in accordance with applicable requirements of the Food and Drug Administration.

(B) the Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research shall meet quarterly with the Department of Defense to discuss the development status of regenerative medicine advanced therapy, blood, and vaccine medical products and projects that are the highest priorities to the Department of Defense (which may include freeze dried plasma products and platelet alternatives), unless the Secretary of Defense determines that any such meetings are not necessary.

(4) Medical product

In this subsection, the term “medical product” means a drug (as defined in section 321 of this title ), a device (as defined in such section 321 of this title ), or a biological product (as defined in section 262 of title 42 ).
