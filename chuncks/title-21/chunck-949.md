(i) the public health; or

(ii) military preparedness and effectiveness; and

(B) the expiration date extension is supported by an appropriate scientific evaluation that is conducted or accepted by the Secretary.

(3) Effect

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], an eligible product shall not be considered an unapproved product (as defined in section 360bbb–3(a)(2)(A) of this title ) and shall not be deemed adulterated or misbranded under this chapter because, with respect to such product, the Secretary has, under paragraph (1), extended the expiration date and authorized the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of such product after the expiration date provided by the manufacturer.

(4) Expiration date

For purposes of this subsection, the term “expiration date” means the date established through appropriate stability testing required by the regulations issued by the Secretary to ensure that the product meets applicable standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity at the time of use.
