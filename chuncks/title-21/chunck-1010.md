### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360ccc. Conditional approval of new animal drugs for minor use and minor species and certain new animal drugs
##### (c) Order of approval or refusal after hearing

If the Secretary finds, after giving the applicant notice and an opportunity for an informal hearing, that

(1) any of the provisions of section 360b(d)(1)(A) through (D) or (F) through (I) of this title are applicable;

(2) the information submitted to the Secretary as part of the application and any other information before the Secretary with respect to such drug, is insufficient to show that there is a reasonable expectation that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; or

(3) another person has received approval under section 360b of this title for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use, and that person is able to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which the drug is intended; the Secretary shall issue an order refusing to conditionally approve the application. If, after such notice and opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary finds that paragraphs (1) through (3) do not apply, the Secretary shall issue an order conditionally approving the application effective for one year and publish a Federal Register notice of the conditional approval. Any order issued under this subsection refusing to conditionally approve an application shall state the findings upon which it is based.
