##### (c) Adjustments; annual fee setting

(1) Inflation adjustment

(A) In general

For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B), the dollar amount of the inflation adjustment to the annual base revenue for each fiscal year shall be equal to the product of

(i) such annual base revenue for the fiscal year under subsection (b)(1)(A); and

(ii) the inflation adjustment percentage under subparagraph (B).

(B) Inflation adjustment percentage

The inflation adjustment percentage under this subparagraph for a fiscal year is equal to the sum of

(i) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years, multiplied by the proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of the process for the review of human drug applications (as defined in section 379g(6) of this title ) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years; and

(ii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV; Not Seasonally Adjusted; All items; Annual Index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years of available data multiplied by the proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of the process for the review of human drug applications (as defined in section 379g(6) of this title ) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years.

(2) Strategic hiring and retention adjustment

For each fiscal year, after the annual base revenue established in subsection (b)(1)(A) is adjusted in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), such revenue shall be adjusted further for such fiscal year, in accordance with this paragraph, to reflect changes in the resource capacity needs of the Secretary for the process for the review of human drug applications.

(C) Limitation

Under no circumstances shall an adjustment under this paragraph result in fee revenue for a fiscal year that is less than the sum of the amounts under subsections (b)(1)(A) (the annual base revenue for the fiscal year), (b)(1)(B) (the dollar amount of the inflation adjustment for the fiscal year), and (b)(1)(C) (the dollar amount of the strategic hiring and retention adjustment for the fiscal year).
