##### (e) Definitions

In this section:

(1) Biomarker

The term “biomarker”

(A) means a characteristic (such as a physiologic, pathologic, or anatomic characteristic or measurement) that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic intervention; and

(B) includes a surrogate endpoint.

(2) Biomedical research consortia

The term “biomedical research consortia” means collaborative groups that may take the form of public-private partnerships and may include government agencies, institutions of higher education (as defined in section 1001(a) of title 20 ), patient advocacy groups, industry representatives, clinical and scientific experts, and other relevant entities and individuals.

(3) Clinical outcome assessment

The term “clinical outcome assessment” means

(A) a measurement of a patient’s symptoms, overall mental state, or the effects of a disease or condition on how the patient functions; and

(B) includes a patient-reported outcome.

(4) Context of use

The term “context of use” means, with respect to a drug development tool, the circumstances under which the drug development tool is to be used in drug development and regulatory review.

(5) Drug development tool

The term “drug development tool” includes

(A) a biomarker;

(B) a clinical outcome assessment; and

(C) any other method, material, or measure that the Secretary determines aids drug development and regulatory review for purposes of this section.

(6) Patient-reported outcome

The term “patient-reported outcome” means a measurement based on a report from a patient regarding the status of the patient’s health condition without amendment or interpretation of the patient’s report by a clinician or any other person.

(7) Qualification

(8) Requestor

The term “requestor” means an entity or entities, including a drug sponsor or a biomedical research consortia, seeking to qualify a drug development tool for a proposed context of use under this section.

(9) Surrogate endpoint

The term “surrogate endpoint” means a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure, that is not itself a direct measurement of clinical benefit, and

(A) is known to predict clinical benefit and could be used to support traditional approval of a drug or biological product; or

(B) is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and could be used to support the accelerated approval of a drug or biological product in accordance with section 356(c) of this title .
