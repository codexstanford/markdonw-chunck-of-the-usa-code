#### § 379j–12. Authority to assess and use animal drug fees
##### (g) Crediting and availability of fees

(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2)(C), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of animal drug applications.

(2) Collections and appropriation Acts

(A) In general

The fees authorized by this section

(i) subject to subparagraph (C), shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year, and

(ii) shall be available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of animal drug applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 2003 multiplied by the adjustment factor.

(B) Compliance

The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of animal drug applications

(i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or

(ii)

(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); and

(II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii).

(C) Provision for early payments

Payment of fees authorized under this section for a fiscal year, prior to the due date for such fees, may be accepted by the Secretary in accordance with authority provided in advance in a prior year appropriations Act.

(3) Authorization of appropriations

For each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2023, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount established under subsection (b) for the fiscal year, as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c) and paragraph (5).

(4) Excess collections

If the sum total of fees collected under this section for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of fees authorized to be appropriated for such year under paragraph (3), the excess collections shall be credited to the appropriations account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1).

(5) Recovery of collection shortfalls

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraph (B)

(i) for fiscal year 2021, the amount of fees otherwise authorized to be collected under this section shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which the amount collected under this section and appropriated for fiscal year 2019 falls below the amount of fees authorized for fiscal year 2019 under paragraph (3);

(ii) for fiscal year 2022, the amount of fees otherwise authorized to be collected under this section shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which the amount collected under this section and appropriated for fiscal year 2020 falls below the amount of fees authorized for fiscal year 2020 under paragraph (3); and

(iii) for fiscal year 2023, the amount of fees otherwise authorized to be collected under this section shall be increased by the cumulative amount, if any, by which the amount collected under this section and appropriated for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (including estimated collections for fiscal year 2022) falls below the cumulative amount of fees authorized for such fiscal years under paragraph (3).

(B) Reduction of shortfall-based fee increase by prior year excess collections

(i) In general

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall, in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, reduce any fee increase otherwise applicable for a fiscal year under subparagraph (A) by the amount of any excess collections under this section for preceding fiscal years (after fiscal year 2018).

(ii) Workload-based fee accounting

In applying clause (i), the Secretary shall account for the reduction of workload-based fee revenue increases by excess collections under subsection (c)(3)(B), in such manner as needed to provide that no portion of any excess collections described in clause (i) is applied for purposes of reducing fee increases under both such subsection (c)(3)(B) and this paragraph.

(C) Rule of application

Under no circumstances shall adjustments under this paragraph result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established in subsection (b), as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c).
