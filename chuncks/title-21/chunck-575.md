A drug is eligible for designation as a regenerative advanced therapy under this subsection if

(7) Postapproval requirements

The sponsor of a regenerative advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to the postapproval requirements under subsection (c) may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements, as the Secretary may require, through
