### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 353d. Process to update labeling for certain generic drugs
##### (h) Limitations; generic drugs

(1) In general

With respect to any labeling change required under this section, the generic version shall be deemed to have the same conditions of use and the same labeling as its reference listed drug for purposes of clauses (i) and (v) of section 355(j)(2)(A) of this title . Any labeling change so required shall not have any legal effect for the applicant that is different than the legal effect that would have resulted if a supplemental application had been submitted and approved to conform the labeling of the generic version to a change in the labeling of the reference drug.

(2) Supplemental applications

Changes to labeling made in accordance with this section shall not be eligible for an exclusivity period under this chapter.

(3) Selection of drugs

The Secretary shall not identify a drug as a covered drug or select a drug label for updating under subsection (b) or (c) solely based on the availability of new safety information. Upon identification of a drug as a covered drug under subsection (b), the Secretary may then consider the availability of new safety information (as defined in section 355–1(b) of this title ) in determining whether the drug is a selected drug and in determining what labeling changes are appropriate.
