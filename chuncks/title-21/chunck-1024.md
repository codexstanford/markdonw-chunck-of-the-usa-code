#### § 360ccc–1. Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor species
##### (f) Removal from index; suspended listing

(1) If the Secretary finds, after due notice to the person who requested the index listing and an opportunity for an informal conference, that

(A) the expert panel failed to meet the requirements as set forth by the Secretary by regulation;

(B) on the basis of new information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary when the new animal drug was listed in the index, the benefits of using the new animal drug for the indexed use do not outweigh its risks to the target animal;

(C) the conditions of subsection (c)(2) of this section are no longer satisfied;

(D) the manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance with current good manufacturing practices;

(E) the labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal drug is not in accordance with the index entry;

(F) the conditions and limitations of use associated with the index listing have not been followed; or

(G) the request for indexing contains any untrue statement of material fact, the Secretary shall remove the new animal drug from the index. The decision of the Secretary following an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.

(2) If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that the use of the drug would present a risk to the health of humans or other animals, the Secretary may

(A) suspend the listing of such drug immediately;

(B) give the person listed in the index prompt notice of the Secretary’s action; and

(C) afford that person the opportunity for an informal conference. The decision of the Secretary following an informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
