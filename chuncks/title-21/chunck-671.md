The sponsor of a drug intended to be designated as a qualified infectious disease product may request that the Secretary provide written recommendations for nonclinical and clinical investigations which the Secretary believes may be necessary to be conducted with the drug before such drug may be approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355 ) for use in treating, detecting, preventing, or identifying a qualifying pathogen, as defined in section 505E of such Act [ 21 U.S.C. 355f ].
