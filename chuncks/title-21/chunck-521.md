If a person fails to submit a required assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3), fails to meet the applicable requirements in subsection (a)(4), or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in subsection (a) or (b), in accordance with applicable provisions of subsections (a) and (b), the following shall apply:

(1) Beginning 270 days after July 9, 2012 , the Secretary shall issue a non-compliance letter to such person informing them of such failure to submit or meet the requirements of the applicable subsection. Such letter shall require the person to respond in writing within 45 calendar days of issuance of such letter. Such response may include the person’s request for a deferral extension if applicable. Such letter and the person’s written response to such letter shall be made publicly available on the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration 60 calendar days after issuance, with redactions for any trade secrets and confidential commercial information. If the Secretary determines that the letter was issued in error, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply.

(2) The drug or biological product that is the subject of an assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3), applicable requirements in subsection (a)(4), or request for approval of a pediatric formulation, may be considered misbranded solely because of that failure and subject to relevant enforcement action (except that the drug or biological product shall not be subject to action under section 333 of this title ), but such failure shall not be the basis for a proceeding
