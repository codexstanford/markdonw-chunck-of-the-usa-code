#### § 384. Importation of prescription drugs
##### (j) Waiver authority for importation by individuals

(1) Declarations

Congress declares that in the enforcement against individuals of the prohibition of importation of prescription drugs and devices, the Secretary should

(A) focus enforcement on cases in which the importation by an individual poses a significant threat to public health; and

(B) exercise discretion to permit individuals to make such importations in circumstances in which

(i) the importation is clearly for personal use; and

(ii) the prescription drug or device imported does not appear to present an unreasonable risk to the individual.

(2) Waiver authority

(A) In general

The Secretary may grant to individuals, by regulation or on a case-by-case basis, a waiver of the prohibition of importation of a prescription drug or device or class of prescription drugs or devices, under such conditions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

(B) Guidance on case-by-case waivers

The Secretary shall publish, and update as necessary, guidance that accurately describes circumstances in which the Secretary will consistently grant waivers on a case-by-case basis under subparagraph (A), so that individuals may know with the greatest practicable degree of certainty whether a particular importation for personal use will be permitted.

(3) Drugs imported from Canada

In particular, the Secretary shall by regulation grant individuals a waiver to permit individuals to import into the United States a prescription drug that

(A) is imported from a licensed pharmacy for personal use by an individual, not for resale, in quantities that do not exceed a 90-day supply;

(B) is accompanied by a copy of a valid prescription;

(C) is imported from Canada, from a seller registered with the Secretary;

(D) is a prescription drug approved by the Secretary under subchapter V;

(E) is in the form of a final finished dosage that was manufactured in an establishment registered under section 360 of this title ; and

(F) is imported under such other conditions as the Secretary determines to be necessary to ensure public safety.
