### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360bbb–3. Authorization for medical products for use in emergencies
##### (l) Option to carry out authorized activities

Nothing in this section provides the Secretary any authority to require any person to carry out any activity that becomes lawful pursuant to an authorization under this section, and no person is required to inform the Secretary that the person will not be carrying out such activity, except that a manufacturer of a sole-source unapproved product authorized for emergency use shall report to the Secretary within a reasonable period of time after the issuance by the Secretary of such authorization if such manufacturer does not intend to carry out any activity under the authorization. This section only has legal effect on a person who carries out an activity for which an authorization under this section is issued. This section does not modify or affect activities carried out pursuant to other provisions of this chapter or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act [ 42 U.S.C. 262 ]. Nothing in this subsection may be construed as restricting the Secretary from imposing conditions on persons who carry out any activity pursuant to an authorization under this section.
