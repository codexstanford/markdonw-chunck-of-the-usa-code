#### § 360e–1. Pediatric uses of devices
##### (b) Determination of pediatric effectiveness based on similar course of disease or condition or similar effect of device on adults

(1) In general

If the course of the disease or condition and the effects of the device are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary may conclude that adult data may be used to support a determination of a reasonable assurance of effectiveness in pediatric populations, as appropriate.

(2) Extrapolation between subpopulations

A study may not be needed in each pediatric subpopulation if data from one subpopulation can be extrapolated to another subpopulation.
