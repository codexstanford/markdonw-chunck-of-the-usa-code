### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 360j. General provisions respecting control of devices intended for human use
##### (g) Exemption for devices for investigational use
######## (C) Consistent with paragraph (1), the Secretary shall not disapprove an application under this subsection because the Secretary determines that

(i) the investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device;

(ii) the investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or

(iii) an additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.

(5) The Secretary may by order withdraw an exemption granted under this subsection for a device if the Secretary determines that the conditions applicable to the device under this subsection for such exemption are not met. Such an order may be issued only after opportunity for an informal hearing, except that such an order may be issued before the provision of an opportunity for an informal hearing if the Secretary determines that the continuation of testing under the exemption with respect to which the order is to be issued will result in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
