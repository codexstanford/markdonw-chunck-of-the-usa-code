### CHAPTER 13— DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL
#### § 826. Production quotas for controlled substances
##### (i) Strengthening considerations for DEA opioid quotas
######## (B) In estimating diversion under this paragraph, the Attorney General

(i) shall consider information the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, determines reliable on rates of overdose deaths and abuse and overall public health impact related to the covered controlled substance in the United States; and

(ii) may take into consideration whatever other sources of information the Attorney General determines reliable.

(C) After estimating the amount of diversion of a covered controlled substance, the Attorney General shall make appropriate quota reductions, as determined by the Attorney General, from the quota the Attorney General would have otherwise established had such diversion not been considered.

(2)

(A) For any year for which the approved aggregate production quota for a covered controlled substance is higher than the approved aggregate production quota for the covered controlled substance for the previous year, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall include in the final order an explanation of why the public health benefits of increasing the quota clearly outweigh the consequences of having an increased volume of the covered controlled substance available for sale, and potential diversion, in the United States.

(B) Not later than 1 year after October 24, 2018 , and every year thereafter, the Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives the following information with regard to each covered controlled substance:

(i) An anonymized count of the total number of manufacturers issued individual manufacturing quotas that year for the covered controlled substance.

(ii) An anonymized count of how many such manufacturers were issued an approved manufacturing quota that was higher than the quota issued to that manufacturer for the covered controlled substance in the previous year.

(3) Not later than 1 year after October 24, 2018 , the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report on how the Attorney General, when fixing and adjusting production and manufacturing quotas under this section for covered controlled substances, will

(A) take into consideration changes in the accepted medical use of the covered controlled substances; and

(B) work with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on methods to appropriately and anonymously estimate the type and amount of covered controlled substances that are submitted for collection from approved drug collection receptacles, mail-back programs, and take-back events.
