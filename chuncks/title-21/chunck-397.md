### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 353. Exemptions and consideration for certain drugs, devices, and biological products
##### (g) Regulation of combination products
######## (F) If a sponsor of a combination product disagrees with the determination under subparagraph (D)

(i) such sponsor may request, and the Secretary shall provide, a substantive rationale to such sponsor that references scientific evidence provided by the sponsor and any other scientific evidence relied upon by the Secretary to support such determination; and

(ii)

(I) the sponsor of the combination product may propose one or more studies (which may be nonclinical, clinical, or both) to establish the relevance, if any, of the chemical action in achieving the primary mode of action of such product;

(II) if the sponsor proposes any such studies, the Secretary and the sponsor of such product shall collaborate and seek to reach agreement, within a reasonable time of such proposal, not to exceed 90 calendar days, on the design of such studies; and

(III) if an agreement is reached under subclause (II) and the sponsor conducts one or more of such studies, the Secretary shall consider the data resulting from any such study when reevaluating the determination of the primary mode of action of such product, and unless and until such reevaluation has occurred and the Secretary issues a new determination, the determination of the Secretary under subparagraph (D) shall remain in effect.

(2)

(A) 1  (i) To establish clarity and certainty for the sponsor, the sponsor of a combination product may request a meeting on such combination product. If the Secretary concludes that a determination of the primary mode of action pursuant to paragraph (1)(D) is necessary, the sponsor may request such meeting only after the Secretary makes such determination. If the sponsor submits a written meeting request, the Secretary shall, not later than 75 calendar days after receiving such request, meet with the sponsor of such combination product.
