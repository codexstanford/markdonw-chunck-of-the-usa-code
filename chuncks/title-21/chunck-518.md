### CHAPTER 9— FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT
#### § 355c. Research into pediatric uses for drugs and biological products
##### (a) New drugs and biological products

(1) In general

(A) General requirements

Except with respect to an application for which subparagraph (B) applies, a person that submits, on or after September 27, 2007 , an application (or supplement to an application) for a drug

(i) under section 355 of this title for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration; or

(ii) under section 262 of title 42 for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration, shall submit with the application the assessments described in paragraph (2).

(B) Certain molecularly targeted cancer indications

A person that submits, on or after the date that is 3 years after August 18, 2017 , an original application for a new active ingredient under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42 , shall submit with the application reports on the investigation described in paragraph (3) if the drug or biological product that is the subject of the application is

(i) intended for the treatment of an adult cancer; and

(ii) directed at a molecular target that the Secretary determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.

(2) Assessments

(A) In general

The assessments referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate

(i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and

(ii) to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective.

(B) Similar course of disease or similar effect of drug or biological product

(i) In general

If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.

(ii) Extrapolation between age groups

A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if data from one age group can be extrapolated to another age group.

(iii) Information on extrapolation

A brief documentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be included in any pertinent reviews for the application under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42 .

(3) Molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation

(A) In general

With respect to a drug or biological product described in paragraph (1)(B), the investigation described in this paragraph is a molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, which shall be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the study is required, regarding dosing, safety, and preliminary efficacy to inform potential pediatric labeling.

(B) Extrapolation of data

Paragraph (2)(B) shall apply to investigations described in this paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as paragraph (2)(B) applies with respect to the assessments required under paragraph (1)(A).

(C) Deferrals and waivers

Deferrals and waivers under paragraphs (4) and (5) shall apply to investigations described in this paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as such deferrals and waivers apply with respect to the assessments under paragraph (2)(B).

(4) Deferral

(A) In general

On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may defer submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation required under paragraph (1)(B) until a specified date after approval of the drug or issuance of the license for a biological product if

(i) the Secretary finds that

(I) the drug or biological product is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete;

(II) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or

(III) there is another appropriate reason for deferral; and

(ii) the applicant submits to the Secretary

(I) certification of the grounds for deferring the assessments or reports on the investigation;

(II) a pediatric study plan as described in subsection (e);

(III) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time; and

(IV) a timeline for the completion of such studies.

(B) Deferral extension

(i) In general

On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may grant an extension of a deferral approved under subparagraph (A) for submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation required under paragraph (1)(B) if

(I) the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subclause (II) or (III) of subparagraph (A)(i) continue to be met; and

(II) the applicant submits a new timeline under subparagraph (A)(ii)(IV) and any significant updates to the information required under subparagraph (A)(ii).

(ii) Timing and information

If the deferral extension under this subparagraph is requested by the applicant, the applicant shall submit the deferral extension request containing the information described in this subparagraph not less than 90 days prior to the date that the deferral would expire. The Secretary shall respond to such request not later than 45 days after the receipt of such letter. If the Secretary grants such an extension, the specified date shall be the extended date. The sponsor of the required assessment under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation under paragraph (1)(B) shall not be issued a letter described in subsection (d) unless the specified or extended date of submission for such required studies has passed or if the request for an extension is pending. For a deferral that has expired prior to July 9, 2012 , or that will expire prior to 270 days after July 9, 2012 , a deferral extension shall be requested by an applicant not later than 180 days after July 9, 2012 . The Secretary shall respond to any such request as soon as practicable, but not later than 1 year after July 9, 2012 . Nothing in this clause shall prevent the Secretary from updating the status of a study or studies publicly if components of such study or studies are late or delayed.

(C) Annual review

(i) In general

On an annual basis following the approval of a deferral under subparagraph (A), the applicant shall submit to the Secretary the following information:

(I) Information detailing the progress made in conducting pediatric studies.

(II) If no progress has been made in conducting such studies, evidence and documentation that such studies will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time.

(III) Projected completion date for pediatric studies.

(IV) The reason or reasons why a deferral or deferral extension continues to be necessary.

(ii) Public availability

Not later than 90 days after the submission to the Secretary of the information submitted through the annual review under clause (i), the Secretary shall make available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration

(I) such information;

(II) the name of the applicant for the product subject to the assessment or investigation;

(III) the date on which the product was approved; and

(IV) the date of each deferral or deferral extension under this paragraph for the product.

(5) Waivers

(A) Full waiver

On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments or reports on the investigation for a drug or biological product under this subsection if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that

(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients is so small or the patients are geographically dispersed);

(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups; or

(iii) the drug or biological product

(I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients; and

(II) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients.

(B) Partial waiver

On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments or reports on the investigation for a drug or biological product under this subsection with respect to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that

(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed);

(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group;

(iii) the drug or biological product

(I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age group; and

(II) is not likely to be used by a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group; or

(iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed.

(C) Pediatric formulation not possible

If a partial waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only the pediatric groups requiring that formulation. An applicant seeking such a partial waiver shall submit to the Secretary documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed and, if the waiver is granted, the applicant’s submission shall promptly be made available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through posting on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.

(D) Labeling requirement

If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological product.
