### CHAPTER 7— LIQUIDATION
#### § 707. Dismissal of a case or conversion to a case under chapter 11 or 13
###### (a) The court may dismiss a case under this chapter only after notice and a hearing and only for cause, including
######## (D) Subparagraphs (A) through (C) shall not apply, and the court may not dismiss or convert a case based on any form of means testing

(i) if the debtor is a disabled veteran (as defined in section 3741(1) of title 38 ), and the indebtedness occurred primarily during a period during which he or she was

(I) on active duty (as defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10 ); or

(II) performing a homeland defense activity (as defined in section 901(1) of title 32 ); or

(ii) with respect to the debtor, while the debtor is

(I) on, and during the 540-day period beginning immediately after the debtor is released from, a period of active duty (as defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10 ) of not less than 90 days; or

(II) performing, and during the 540-day period beginning immediately after the debtor is no longer performing, a homeland defense activity (as defined in section 901(1) of title 32 ) performed for a period of not less than 90 days; if after September 11, 2001 , the debtor while a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces or a member of the National Guard, was called to such active duty or performed such homeland defense activity.

(3) In considering under paragraph (1) whether the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter in a case in which the presumption in paragraph (2)(A)(i) does not arise or is rebutted, the court shall consider

(A) whether the debtor filed the petition in bad faith; or

(B) the totality of the circumstances (including whether the debtor seeks to reject a personal services contract and the financial need for such rejection as sought by the debtor) of the debtor’s financial situation demonstrates abuse.

(4)
