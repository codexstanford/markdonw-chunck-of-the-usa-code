### CHAPTER 11— REORGANIZATION
#### § 1114. Payment of insurance benefits to retired employees
###### (l) If the debtor, during the 180-day period ending on the date of the filing of the petition

(1) modified retiree benefits; and

(2) was insolvent on the date such benefits were modified; the court, on motion of a party in interest, and after notice and a hearing, shall issue an order reinstating as of the date the modification was made, such benefits as in effect immediately before such date unless the court finds that the balance of the equities clearly favors such modification.

(m) This section shall not apply to any retiree, or the spouse or dependents of such retiree, if such retiree’s gross income for the twelve months preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition equals or exceeds $250,000, unless such retiree can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that he is unable to obtain health, medical, life, and disability coverage for himself, his spouse, and his dependents who would otherwise be covered by the employer’s insurance plan, comparable to the coverage provided by the employer on the day before the filing of a petition under this title.
