(ii) shall not be credited as overtime hours for any purpose.

(B) Priority for same day work .

In substituting hours of work under subparagraph (A), work performed on the same day as the period of leave without pay shall be substituted first.

(C) Priority for regular time substitution .

Hours of work shall be substituted for regular time work under this paragraph before being substituted for scheduled overtime under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).

(2) Overtime work.

For a period of absence during scheduled overtime (as described in paragraph (2)(F) or (3)(F) of subsection (b)) within a work period, an equal period of additional work in the same work period

(3) Application of compensatory time .

If a border patrol agent does not have sufficient additional work in a work period to substitute for all periods of absence during scheduled overtime (as described in paragraph (2)(F) or (3)(F) of subsection (b)) within that work period, any accrued compensatory time off under section 5542(g) shall be applied to satisfy the hours obligation.

(4) Insufficient hours .

If a border patrol agent has a remaining hours obligation of scheduled overtime after applying paragraphs (2) and (3), any additional work in subsequent work periods that would otherwise be credited under section 5542(g) shall be applied towards the hours obligation until that obligation is satisfied.
