### CHAPTER 84— FEDERAL EMPLOYEES’ RETIREMENT SYSTEM
#### § 8415. Computation of basic annuity
###### (f) The annuity of an air traffic controller or former air traffic controller retiring under section 8412(a) is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has at least 5 years of service in any combination as

(1) an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i);

(2) a first level supervisor of an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i); or

(3) a second level supervisor of an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i); so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to such type of service shall be computed by multiplying 1 7/10 percent of the individual’s average pay by the years of such service.

(g)

(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis

(A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and

(B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee’s actual service, as determined by prorating the employee’s total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.

(2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.

(h)

(1) The annuity of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is computed in accordance with applicable provisions of this section, except that the annuity shall be reduced by five-twelfths of 1 percent for each full month by which the commencement date of the annuity precedes the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the employee or Member.

(2)

(A) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) if the employee or Member would satisfy the age and service requirements for title to an annuity under section 8412(a), (b), (d)(1)(B), (e)(2), or (f)(2), determined as if the employee or Member had, as of the date of separation, attained the age specified in subparagraph (B).

(B) A determination under subparagraph (A) shall be based on how old the employee or Member will be as of the date on which the annuity under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is to commence.

(i)

(1) In applying subsection (a) with respect to an employee under paragraph (2), the percentage applied under such subsection shall be 1.1 percent, rather than 1 percent.

(2) This subsection applies in the case of an employee who

(A) retires entitled to an annuity under section 8412; and

(B) at the time of the separation on which entitlement to the annuity is based, is at least 62 years of age and has completed at least 20 years of service; but does not apply in the case of a Congressional employee, military technician (dual status), law enforcement officer, member of the Supreme Court Police, firefighter, nuclear materials courier, air traffic controller, or customs and border protection officer  1

(j) The annuity of a Member who has served in a position in the executive branch for which the rate of basic pay was reduced for the duration of the service of the Member in that position to remove the impediment to the appointment of the Member imposed by article I, section 6, clause 2 of the Constitution, shall, subject to a deposit in the Fund as provided under section 8422(g), be computed as though the rate of basic pay which would otherwise have been in effect during that period of service had been in effect.

(k)

(1) For purposes of this subsection, the term “physicians comparability allowance” refers to an amount described in section 8331(3)(H).

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no part of a physicians comparability allowance shall be treated as basic pay for purposes of any computation under this section unless, before the date of the separation on which entitlement to annuity is based, the separating individual has completed at least 15 years of service as a Government physician (whether performed before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection).

(3) If the condition under paragraph (2) is met, then, any amounts received by the individual in the form of a physicians comparability allowance shall (for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2)) be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable, which shall be determined as follows: If the total amount of service

performed, on or after the date of

the enactment of this subsection,

as a Government physician is:

Then, the percentage allowable is:

Less than 2 years

0

At least 2 but less than 4 years

25

At least 4 but less than 6 years

50

At least 6 but less than 8 years

75

At least 8 years

100.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, 100 percent of all amounts received as a physicians comparability allowance shall, to the extent attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, be treated as basic pay (without regard to any of the preceding provisions of this subsection) for purposes of computing

(A) an annuity under section 8452; and

(B) a survivor annuity under subchapter IV, if based on the service of an individual who dies before separating from service.
