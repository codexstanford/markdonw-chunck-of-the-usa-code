#### § 1006. Responsibilities of the Administrator
###### (d) Guidelines for Uniform Fair Pay Rates.

(1) In general .

The Administrator, after study and consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall establish guidelines with respect to uniform fair rates of pay for comparable services of members, staffs, and consultants of advisory committees in a manner that gives appropriate recognition to the responsibilities and qualifications required and other relevant factors. The guidelines shall provide that

(A) a member of an advisory committee or of the staff of an advisory committee shall not receive compensation at a rate in excess of the maximum rate payable under section 5376 of this title ;

(B) members of advisory committees, while engaged in the performance of their duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of this title for persons employed intermittently in the Government service; and

(C) members of advisory committees may be provided services pursuant to section 3102 of this title while in performance of their advisory committee duties if the members

(i) are blind or deaf or otherwise qualify as individuals with disabilities (within the meaning of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( 29 U.S.C. 791 )); and

(ii) do not otherwise qualify for assistance under section 3102 of this title by reason of being an employee of an agency (within the meaning of section 3102(a)(1) of this title ).

(2) Pay for full-time employees .

Nothing in this subsection shall prevent an individual from receiving compensation at the rate at which the individual would otherwise be compensated (or was compensated) as a full-time employee of the United States if the individual

(A) is a full-time employee of the United States without regard to service with an advisory committee; or

(B) was a full-time employee of the United States immediately before service with an advisory committee.
