### CHAPTER 83— RETIREMENT
#### § 8344. Annuities and pay on reemployment
###### (a) If an annuitant receiving annuity from the Fund, except

(1) a disability annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of his recovery or restoration of earning capacity;

(2) an annuitant whose annuity, based on an involuntary separation (other than an automatic separation or an involuntary separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency), is terminated under subsection (b) of this section;

(3) an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (c) of this section; or

(4) a Member receiving annuity from the Fund; becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, his service on and after the date he is so employed is covered by this subchapter. Deductions for the Fund may not be withheld from his pay unless the individual elects to have such deductions withheld under subparagraph (A). An amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 5551 of this title . The amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis, except as President, for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, in employment not excluding him from coverage under section 8331(1)(i) or (ii) of this title

(A) deductions for the Fund may be withheld from his pay (if the employee so elects), and his annuity on termination of employment is increased by an annuity computed under section 8339(a), (b), (d), (e), (h), (i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply based on the period of employment and the basic pay, before deduction, averaged during that employment; and

(B) his lump-sum credit may not be reduced by annuity paid during that employment. If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or section 8339(k)(2) of this title , the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) of this subsection is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of this title is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under such subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under such subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that he does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. If the described employment of the annuitant continues for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, he may elect, instead of the benefit provided by subparagraph (A) of this subsection, to deposit in the Fund (to the extent deposits or deductions have not otherwise been made) an amount computed under section 8334(c) of this title covering that employment and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed and the described employment had continued for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, the person entitled to survivor annuity under section 8341(b) of this title may elect to deposit in the Fund and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter.

(b) If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, whose annuity is based on an involuntary separation (other than an automatic separation or an involuntary separation for cause or charges on misconduct or delinquency) is reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment.

(c) If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, is appointed by the President to a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or is elected as a Member, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment. Upon separation from such position, an individual whose annuity is so terminated is entitled to have his rights redetermined under this subchapter, except that the amount of the annuity resulting from such redetermination shall be at least equal to the amount of the terminated annuity plus any increases under section 8340 of this title occurring after the termination and before the commencement of the redetermined annuity.
