#### § 5334. Rate on change of position or type of appointment; regulations
###### (g) In the case of an employee who

(1) moves to a new official duty station, and

(2) by virtue of such move, becomes subject to a different pay schedule, any rate adjustment under the preceding provisions of this section, with respect to such employee in connection with such move, shall be made

(A) first, by determining the rate of pay to which such employee would be entitled at the new official duty station based on such employee’s position, grade, and step (or relative position in the rate range) before the move, and

(B) then, by applying the provisions of this section that would otherwise apply (if any), treating the rate determined under subparagraph (A) as if it were the rate last received by the employee before the rate adjustment.
