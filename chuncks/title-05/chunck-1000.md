#### § 5565. Agency review
###### (b) When a finding of death is made under subsection (a) of this section, it shall include the date death is presumed to have occurred for the purpose of the ending of crediting pay and allowances and settlement of accounts. That date is

(1) the day after the day on which the 12 months in a missing status ends; or

(2) a day determined by the head of the agency concerned or his designee when the missing status has been continued under subsection (a) of this section.

(c) For the purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of an employee in active service is deemed an employee. A determination under this section made by the head of the agency concerned or his designee is conclusive on all other agencies of the United States. This section does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.
