### CHAPTER 83— RETIREMENT
#### § 8339. Computation of annuity
###### (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is

(1) 1½ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as does not exceed 5 years; plus

(2) 1¾ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 5 years but does not exceed 10 years; plus

(3) 2 percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 10 years. However, when it results in a larger annuity, 1 percent of his average pay plus $25 is substituted for the percentage specified by paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, or any combination thereof.
