### CHAPTER 84— FEDERAL EMPLOYEES’ RETIREMENT SYSTEM
#### § 8411. Creditable service
###### (g) Any employee who

(1) served in a position in which the employee was excluded from coverage under this subchapter because the employee was covered under a retirement system established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act; and

(2) transferred without a break in service to a position to which the employee was appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and in which position the employee is subject to this subchapter, shall be treated for all purposes of this subchapter as if any service that would have been creditable under the retirement system established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act was service performed while subject to this subchapter if any employee and employer deductions, contributions or rights with respect to the employee’s service are transferred from such retirement system to the Fund.

(h) An employee or Member shall be allowed credit for service as a volunteer or volunteer leader under part A of title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as a full-time volunteer enrolled in a program of at least 1 year’s duration under part A, B, 1 or C of title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, or as a volunteer or volunteer leader under the Peace Corps Act performed at any time prior to the separation on which the entitlement to any annuity under this subchapter is based if the employee or Member has made a deposit with interest, if any, with respect to such service under section 8422(f).

(i) 2 For purposes of subsection (b)(5), the term “Bank Plan” means the benefit structure in which employees of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System appointed on or after January 1, 1984 , participate, which benefit structure is a component of the Retirement Plan for Employees of the Federal Reserve System, established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act (and any redesignated or successor version of such benefit structure, if so identified in writing by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for purposes of this chapter).

(i)

(1) 2 Upon application to the Office of Personnel Management, any individual who was an employee on the date of enactment of this paragraph, and who has on such date or thereafter acquired 5 years or more of creditable civilian service under this section (exclusive of service for which credit is allowed under this subsection) shall be allowed credit (as service as a congressional employee) for service before December 31, 1990 , while employed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Congressional Committee, or the Republican National Congressional Committee, if

(2) Service credited under subsection (b)(6) may not also be credited under any other retirement system provided for employees paid from nonappropriated funds of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality.

(l)

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the service of an individual finally convicted of an offense described in paragraph (2) shall not be taken into account for purposes of this chapter, except that this sentence applies only to service rendered as a Member (irrespective of when rendered). Any such individual (or other person determined under section 8424(d), if applicable) shall be entitled to be paid so much of such individual’s lump-sum credit as is attributable to service to which the preceding sentence applies.

(2) An offense described in this paragraph is any offense described in section 8332( o )(2)(B) for which the following apply:

(A) Every act or omission of the individual (referred to in paragraph (1)) that is needed to satisfy the elements of the offense occurs while the individual is a Member, the President, the Vice President, or an elected official of a State or local government.

(B) Every act or omission of the individual that is needed to satisfy the elements of the offense directly relates to the performance of the individual’s official duties as a Member, the President, the Vice President, or an elected official of a State or local government.

(C) The offense is committed after the date of enactment of this subsection.

(3) An individual convicted of an offense described in paragraph (2) shall not, after the date of the final conviction, be eligible to participate in the retirement system under this chapter while serving as a Member.

(4) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe any regulations necessary to carry out this subsection. Such regulations shall include

(A) provisions under which interest on any lump-sum payment under the second sentence of paragraph (1) shall be limited in a manner similar to that specified in the last sentence of section 8316(b); and

(B) provisions under which the Office may provide for

(i) the payment, to the spouse or children of any individual referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (1), of any amounts which (but for this clause) would otherwise have been nonpayable by reason of such first sentence, subject to paragraph (5); and

(ii) an appropriate adjustment in the amount of any lump-sum payment under the second sentence of paragraph (1) to reflect the application of clause (i).

(5) Regulations to carry out clause (i) of paragraph (4)(B) shall include provisions to ensure that the authority to make any payment under such clause to the spouse or children of an individual shall be available only to the extent that the application of such clause is considered necessary and appropriate taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the financial needs of the spouse or children, whether the spouse or children participated in an offense described in paragraph (2) of which such individual was finally convicted, and what measures, if any, may be necessary to ensure that the convicted individual does not benefit from any such payment.

(6) For purposes of this subsection

(A) the terms “finally convicted” and “final conviction” refer to a conviction (i) which has not been appealed and is no longer appealable because the time for taking an appeal has expired, or (ii) which has been appealed and the appeals process for which is completed;

(B) the term “Member” has the meaning given such term by section 2106, notwithstanding section 8401(20); and

(C) the term “child” has the meaning given such term by section 8441.
