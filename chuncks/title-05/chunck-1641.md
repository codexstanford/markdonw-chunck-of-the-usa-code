### CHAPTER 84— FEDERAL EMPLOYEES’ RETIREMENT SYSTEM
#### § 8415. Computation of basic annuity
###### (l) The annuity of an employee retiring under this chapter with service credited under section 8411(b)(6) shall be reduced by the amount necessary to ensure that the present value of the annuity payable to the employee under this subchapter is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity that would be payable to the employee under this subchapter if it were computed

(1) on the basis of service that does not include service credited under section 8411(b)(6); and

(2) assuming the employee separated from service on the actual date of the separation of the employee. The amount of the reduction shall be computed under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the administration of this subsection.

(m)

(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires from the position of a registered nurse with the Veterans Health Administration on an immediate annuity, or dies while employed in that position leaving any survivor entitled to an annuity, includes the days of unused sick leave to the credit of that employee under a formal leave system, except that such days shall not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter.

(2)

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (1), in computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes the applicable percentage of the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system and for which days the employee has not received payment, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 under section 6301(2)(x) through (xiii), the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.
