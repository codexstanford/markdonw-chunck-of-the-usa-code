### CHAPTER 90— LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE
#### § 9002. Availability of insurance
###### (e) Underwriting Standards.

(1) Disqualifying condition .

Nothing in this chapter shall be considered to require that long-term care insurance coverage be made available in the case of any individual who would be eligible for benefits immediately.

(2) Spousal parity .

For the purpose of underwriting standards, a spouse of an individual described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of section 9001 shall, as nearly as practicable, be treated like that individual.

(3) Guaranteed issue .

Nothing in this chapter shall be considered to require that long-term care insurance coverage be guaranteed to an eligible individual.

(4) Requirement that contract be fully insured .

In addition to the requirements otherwise applicable under section 9001(9), in order to be considered a qualified long-term care insurance contract for purposes of this chapter, a contract must be fully insured, whether through reinsurance with other companies or otherwise.

(5) Higher standards allowable .

Nothing in this chapter shall, in the case of an individual applying for long-term care insurance coverage under this chapter after the expiration of such individual’s first opportunity to enroll, preclude the application of underwriting standards more stringent than those that would have applied if that opportunity had not yet expired.
