(i) the additional cost to the System which is associated with providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b)(2) of this section and results from such election taking into account (I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity, and (II) the costs associated with providing for the later election; and

(ii) interest on the additional cost determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph computed using the interest rate specified or determined under section 8334(e) of this title for the calendar year in which the amount to be deposited is determined.

(3) An election by an employee or Member under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such employee or Member under subsection (j).

(4) An annuity which is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the employee or Member whose annuity is so reduced.

(5) Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the employee or Member involved elected such annuity at the time of retiring.

(6) The Office shall, on an annual basis, inform each employee or Member who is eligible to make an election under this subsection of the right to make such election and the procedures and deadlines applicable to such election.

(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service that was performed on a part-time basis

(A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and

(B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee’s actual service, as determined by prorating an employee’s total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.

(2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.

(3) In the administration of paragraph (1)

(A) subparagraph (A) of such paragraph shall apply with respect to service performed before, on, or after April 7, 1986 ; and

(B) subparagraph (B) of such paragraph

(i) shall apply with respect to that portion of any annuity which is attributable to service performed on or after April 7, 1986 ; and

(ii) shall not apply with respect to that portion of any annuity which is attributable to service performed before April 7, 1986 .
