### CHAPTER 83— RETIREMENT
#### § 8339. Computation of annuity
###### (g) The annuity of an employee or Member retiring under section 8337 of this title is at least the smaller of

(1) 40 percent of his average pay; or

(2) the sum obtained under subsections (a) through (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s) after increasing his service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of separation and the date he becomes 60 years of age. However, if an employee or Member retiring under section 8337 of this title is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of this title) or pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that employee or Member shall be computed under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate, excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the smaller of the annuity otherwise payable under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate.

(h) The annuity computed under subsections (a), (b), (d)(5), and (f) of this section for an employee retiring under section 8336(d), (h), (j), or ( o ) of this title is reduced by ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month the employee is under 55 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (c) and (f) of this section for a Member retiring under the second or third sentence of section 8336(g) of this title or the third sentence of section 8338(b) of this title is reduced by 1 ⁄ 12 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the Member is under 60 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (a), (d)(6), and (f) of this section for a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces retiring under the second sentence of section 8336(k) of this title or the third sentence of section 8338(c) of this title is reduced by 1 ⁄ 12 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the judge is under 60 years of age at the date of separation.
