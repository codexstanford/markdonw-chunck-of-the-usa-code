(A) in the case of an individual whose continued coverage is based on separation from service, the date which is 18 months after the effective date of the separation;

(A) to any individual who

(i) if subparagraphs (A) and (C) of paragraph (10) of section 8901 were disregarded, would be eligible to be considered a former spouse within the meaning of such paragraph; but

(D) provisions designed to ensure that any coverage pursuant to this subsection does not adversely affect any eligibility for coverage which the individual involved might otherwise have under this chapter (including as a result of any change in personal circumstances) if this subsection had not been enacted.

(3) In the case of an individual

(A) who becomes eligible for continued coverage under this subsection based on a divorce, annulment, or legal separation from a person who, as of the day before the date of the divorce, annulment, or legal separation (as the case may be) was receiving continued coverage under this section based on such person’s separation from service under a self plus one enrollment that covered the individual or under a self and family enrollment; and
