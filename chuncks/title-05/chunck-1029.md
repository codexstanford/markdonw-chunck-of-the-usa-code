### CHAPTER 57— TRAVEL, TRANSPORTATION, AND SUBSISTENCE
#### § 5702. Per diem; employees traveling on official business
######## (A) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title , an employee who is described in subsection (a) of this section and who, with the approval of an appropriate official of the agency concerned, interrupts the travel assignment prior to its completion for a reason specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, may be allowed (subject to the limitation provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph)

(i) reimbursement for expenses of transportation to the location where necessary medical services are provided or the emergency situation exists,

(ii) payments pursuant to subsection (a) of this section until that location is reached, and

(iii) such reimbursement and payments for return to such assignment.

(B) The reimbursement which an employee may be allowed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be the employee’s actual costs of transportation to the location where necessary medical services are provided or the emergency exists, and return to assignment from such location, less the costs of transportation which the employee would have incurred had such travel begun and ended at the employee’s designated post of duty, or home or regular place of business, as the case may be. The payments which an employee may be allowed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be based on the additional time (if any) which was required for the employee’s transportation as a consequence of the transportation’s having begun and ended at a location on the travel assignment (rather than at the employee’s designated post of duty, or home or regular place of business, as the case may be).

(3) Subject to the limitations contained in regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title , an employee who is described in subsection (a) of this section and who interrupts the travel assignment prior to its completion because of an incapacitating illness or injury which is not due to the employee’s own misconduct is entitled to payments pursuant to subsection (a) of this section at the location where the interruption occurred.

(c) This section does not apply to a justice or judge, except to the extent provided by section 456 of title 28 .
