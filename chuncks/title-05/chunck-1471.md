### CHAPTER 81— COMPENSATION FOR WORK INJURIES
#### § 8137. Compensation for noncitizens and nonresidents
###### (a) When the Secretary of Labor finds that the amount of compensation payable to an employee who is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States or Canada, or payable to a dependent of such an employee, is substantially disproportionate to compensation for disability or death payable in similar cases under local statute, regulation, custom, or otherwise at the place outside the continental United States or Canada where the employee is working at the time of injury, he may provide for payment of compensation on a basis reasonably in accord with prevailing local payments in similar cases by

(1) the adoption or adaption of the substantive features, by a schedule or otherwise, of local workmen’s compensation provisions or other local statute, regulation, or custom applicable in cases of personal injury or death; or

(2) establishing special schedules of compensation for injury, death, and loss of use of members and functions of the body for specific classes of employees, areas, and places. Irrespective of the basis adopted, the Secretary may at any time

(A) modify or limit the maximum monthly and total aggregate payments for injury, death, and medical or other benefits;

(B) modify or limit the percentages of the wage of the employee payable as compensation for the injury or death; and

(C) modify, limit, or redesignate the class or classes of beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, including the designation of persons, representatives, or groups entitled to payment under local statute or custom whether or not included in the classes of beneficiaries otherwise specified by this subchapter.
