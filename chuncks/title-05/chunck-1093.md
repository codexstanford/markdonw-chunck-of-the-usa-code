#### § 5753. Recruitment and relocation bonuses
###### (e) The Office may authorize the head of an agency to waive the limitation under subsection (d)(1) based on a critical agency need, subject to regulations prescribed by the Office. Under such a waiver, the maximum bonus allowable shall

(1) be equal to the maximum that would be determined if subsection (d)(1) were applied by substituting “50” for “25”; but

(2) in no event exceed 100 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service period. Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to permit the waiver of any requirement under subsection (c).

(f) The Office shall require that an agency establish a plan for the payment of recruitment bonuses before paying any such bonuses, and a plan for the payment of relocation bonuses before paying any such bonuses, subject to regulations prescribed by the Office.

(g) The Office may prescribe regulations to carry out this section, including regulations relating to the repayment of a bonus under this section in appropriate circumstances when the agreed-upon service period has not been completed.
