#### § 6303. Annual leave; accrual
###### (d) Leave granted under this subchapter is exclusive of time actually and necessarily occupied in going to or from a post of duty and time necessarily occupied awaiting transportation, in the case of an employee

(1) to whom section 6304(b) of this title applies;

(e)

(1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which, for purposes of determining years of service under subsection (a), credit shall, in the case of a newly appointed employee, be given for any prior service of such employee that would not otherwise be creditable for such purposes, if

(A) such service

(i) was performed in a position the duties of which directly relate to the duties of the position to which such employee is so appointed; and

(ii) meets such other requirements as the Office may prescribe; and

(B) in the judgment of the head of the appointing agency, the application of this subsection is necessary in order to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal.

(2) Service described in paragraph (1)

(A) shall be creditable, for the purposes described in paragraph (1), as of the effective date of the employee’s appointment; and

(B) shall not thereafter cease to be so creditable, unless the employee fails to complete a full year of continuous service with the agency.

(3) An employee shall not be eligible for the application of paragraph (1) on the basis of any appointment if, within 90 days before the effective date of such appointment, such employee has held any position in the civil service.
