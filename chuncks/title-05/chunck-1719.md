(d)

(i) subject to adjustment under such section; and

(ii) with a commencement date coinciding with the date the annuitant’s annuity commenced or was restored under this subchapter, as the case may be; and

(B) whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.
