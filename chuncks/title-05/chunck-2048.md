#### § 10203. Basic pay
###### (b) Schedule Adjustment.

(1)

(A) Effective at the beginning of the first pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjustment in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule takes effect under section 5303 or other authority, the schedule of annual rates of basic pay of members (except the Deputy Chiefs, Assistant Chief and Chief) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by a percentage amount corresponding to the percentage adjustment made in the rates of pay under the General Schedule.

(B) The Secretary may establish a methodology of schedule adjustment that

(i) results in uniform fixed-dollar step increments within any given rank; and

(ii) preserves the established percentage differences among rates of different ranks at the same step position.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the payable annual rate of basic pay for positions at the Lieutenant, Captain, and Inspector ranks after adjustment under paragraph (1) may not exceed 95 percent of the rate of pay for level V of the Executive Schedule under subchapter II of chapter 53.

(3) Locality-based comparability payments authorized under section 5304 shall be applicable to the basic pay for all ranks under this section, except locality-based comparability payments may not be paid at a rate which, when added to the rate of basic pay otherwise payable to the member, would cause the total to exceed the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule.
