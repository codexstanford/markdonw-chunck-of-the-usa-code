### CHAPTER 83— RETIREMENT
#### § 8341. Survivor annuities
###### (d) If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, his widow or widower is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of an annuity computed under section 8339(a)–(f), (i), (n), (p), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply with respect to the employee or Member, except that, in the computation of the annuity under such section, the annuity of the employee or Member shall be at least the smaller of

(1) 40 percent of his average pay; or

(2) the sum obtained under such section after increasing his service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 60 years of age. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the annuity payable under this subsection to the widow or widower of an employee or Member may not exceed the difference between

(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this subsection, and

(B) the amount of the survivor annuity payable to any former spouse of such employee or Member under subsection (h) of this section. The annuity of the widow or widower commences on the day after the employee or Member dies. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the widow or widower

(i) dies; or

(ii) except as provided in subsection (k), remarries before becoming 55 years of age.

(e)

(1) For the purposes of this subsection, “former spouse” includes a former spouse who was married to an employee or Member for less than 9 months and a former spouse of an employee or Member who completed less than 18 months of service covered by this subchapter.

(2) If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, or an employee or Member dies after retiring under this subchapter, and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of

(A) 60 percent of the average pay of the employee or Member divided by the number of children;

(B) $900; or

(C) $2,700 divided by the number of children; subject to section 8340 of this title . If the employee or Member is not survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of

(i) 75 percent of the average pay of the employee or Member divided by the number of children;

(ii) $1,080; or

(iii) $3,240 divided by the number of children; subject to section 8340 of this title .

(3) The annuity of a child under this subchapter or under the Act of May 29, 1930 , as amended from and after February 28, 1948 , commences on the day after the employee or Member dies, or commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by subsection (a)(3) of this section, if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child

(A) becomes 18 years of age unless he is then a student as described or incapable of self-support;

(B) becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then such a student;

(C) becomes 22 years of age if he is then such a student and capable of self-support;

(D) ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then incapable of self-support; or

(E) dies or marries; whichever first occurs. On the death of the surviving spouse or former spouse or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though the spouse, former spouse, or child had not survived the employee or Member.

(4) If the annuity of a child under this subchapter terminates under paragraph (3)(E) because of marriage, then, if such marriage ends, such annuity shall resume on the first day of the month in which it ends, but only if

(A) any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund; and

(B) that individual is not otherwise ineligible for such annuity.
