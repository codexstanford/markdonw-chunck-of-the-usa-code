(2) This subsection shall not apply

(A) to retransmission of the signal of a noncommercial television broadcast station;

(B) to retransmission of the signal of a television broadcast station outside the station’s local market by a satellite carrier directly to its subscribers, if

(i) such station was a superstation on May 1, 1991 ;

(ii) as of July 1, 1998 , such station was retransmitted by a satellite carrier under the statutory license of section 119 of title 17 ; and

(ii) as of July 1, 1998 , such station was retransmitted by a satellite carrier under the statutory license of section 119 of title 17 ; or

(E) during the 6-month period beginning on November 29, 1999 , to the retransmission of the signal of a television broadcast station within the station’s local market by a satellite carrier directly to its subscribers under the statutory license of section 122 of title 17 .

(3)

(A) Within 45 days after October 5, 1992 , the Commission shall commence a rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations to govern the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and of the right to signal carriage under section 534 of this title , and such other regulations as are necessary to administer the limitations contained in paragraph (2). The Commission shall consider in such proceeding the impact that the grant of retransmission consent by television stations may have on the rates for the basic service tier and shall ensure that the regulations prescribed under this subsection do not conflict with the Commission’s obligation under section 543(b)(1) of this title to ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such rulemaking proceeding shall be completed within 180 days after October 5, 1992 .

(B) The regulations required by subparagraph (A) shall require that television stations, within one year after October 5, 1992 , and every three years thereafter, make an election between the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and the right to signal carriage under section 534 of this title . If there is more than one cable system which services the same geographic area, a station’s election shall apply to all such cable systems.
