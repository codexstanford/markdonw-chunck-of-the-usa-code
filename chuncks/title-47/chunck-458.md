### CHAPTER 5— WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION
#### § 335. Direct broadcast satellite service obligations
##### (a) Proceeding required to review DBS responsibilities

The Commission shall, within 180 days after October 5, 1992 , initiate a rulemaking proceeding to impose, on providers of direct broadcast satellite service, public interest or other requirements for providing video programming. Any regulations prescribed pursuant to such rulemaking shall, at a minimum, apply the access to broadcast time requirement of section 312(a)(7) of this title and the use of facilities requirements of section 315 of this title to providers of direct broadcast satellite service providing video programming. Such proceeding also shall examine the opportunities that the establishment of direct broadcast satellite service provides for the principle of localism under this chapter, and the methods by which such principle may be served through technological and other developments in, or regulation of, such service.
