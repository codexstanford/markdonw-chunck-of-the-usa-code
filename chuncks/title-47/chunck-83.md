### CHAPTER 5— WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION
#### § 161. Regulatory reform
##### (a) Biennial review of regulations

In every even-numbered year (beginning with 1998), the Commission

(1) shall review all regulations issued under this chapter in effect at the time of the review that apply to the operations or activities of any provider of telecommunications service; and
