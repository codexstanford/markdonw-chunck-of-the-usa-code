In the case of subscribers who have entered into such an agreement before the effective date of this subsection, such notice shall be provided within 180 days of such date and at least once a year thereafter.

(2) Definitions

(A) the term “personally identifiable information” does not include any record of aggregate data which does not identify particular persons;

(B) the term “other service” includes any wire or radio communications service provided using any of the facilities of a satellite carrier that are used in the provision of satellite service; and

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a satellite carrier shall not use any facilities used by the satellite carrier to collect personally identifiable information concerning any subscriber without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscriber concerned.

(B) Exceptions

A satellite carrier may use such facilities to collect such information in order to

(i) obtain information necessary to render a satellite service or other service provided by the satellite carrier to the subscriber; or

(ii) detect unauthorized reception of satellite communications.

(4) Disclosure

(A) Consent to disclosure

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a satellite carrier shall not disclose personally identifiable information concerning any subscriber without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscriber concerned and shall take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or satellite carrier.

(B) Exceptions

A satellite carrier may disclose such information if the disclosure is

(i) necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, a satellite service or other service provided by the satellite carrier to the subscriber;

(ii) subject to paragraph (9), made pursuant to a court order authorizing such disclosure, if the subscriber is notified of such order by the person to whom the order is directed;

(iii) a disclosure of the names and addresses of subscribers to any satellite service or other service, if

(I) the satellite carrier has provided the subscriber the opportunity to prohibit or limit such disclosure; and

(II) the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the

(aa) extent of any viewing or other use by the subscriber of a satellite service or other service provided by the satellite carrier; or

(bb) the nature of any transaction made by the subscriber over any facilities used by the satellite carrier; or

(iv) to a government entity as authorized under chapter 119, 121, or 206 of title 18, except that such disclosure shall not include records revealing satellite subscriber selection of video programming from a satellite carrier.

(5) Access by subscriber

A satellite subscriber shall be provided access to all personally identifiable information regarding that subscriber which is collected and maintained by a satellite carrier. Such information shall be made available to the subscriber at reasonable times and at a convenient place designated by such satellite carrier. A satellite subscriber shall be provided reasonable opportunity to correct any error in such information.

(6) Destruction of information

A satellite carrier shall destroy personally identifiable information if the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and there are no pending requests or orders for access to such information under paragraph (5) or pursuant to a court order.

(7) Penalties

Any person aggrieved by any act of a satellite carrier in violation of this section may bring a civil action in a United States district court. The court may award

(A) actual damages but not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $100 a day for each day of violation or $1,000, whichever is higher;

(B) punitive damages; and

(C) reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred. The remedy provided by this subsection shall be in addition to any other lawful remedy available to a satellite subscriber.

(8) Rule of construction

Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit any State from enacting or enforcing laws consistent with this section for the protection of subscriber privacy.

(9) Court orders

Except as provided in paragraph (4)(B)(iv), a governmental entity may obtain personally identifiable information concerning a satellite subscriber pursuant to a court order only if, in the court proceeding relevant to such court order

(A) such entity offers clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case; and

(B) the subject of the information is afforded the opportunity to appear and contest such entity’s claim.
