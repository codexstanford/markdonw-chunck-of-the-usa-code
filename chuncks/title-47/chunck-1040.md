### CHAPTER 6— COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM
#### § 761. Federal Communications Commission licensing
##### (a) Licensing for separated entities

(1) Competition test

The Commission may not issue a license or construction permit to any separated entity, or renew or permit the assignment or use of any such license or permit, or authorize the use by any entity subject to United States jurisdiction of any space segment owned, leased, or operated by any separated entity, unless the Commission determines that such issuance, renewal, assignment, or use will not harm competition in the telecommunications market of the United States. If the Commission does not make such a determination, it shall deny or revoke authority to use space segment owned, leased, or operated by the separated entity to provide services to, from, or within the United States.

(2) Criteria for competition test

In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763 and 763b  1 of this title, and shall not make such a determination unless the Commission determines that the privatization of any separated entity is consistent with such criteria.
