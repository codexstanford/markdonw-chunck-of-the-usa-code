### CHAPTER 16— BROADBAND ACCESS
#### § 1741. Enabling middle mile broadband infrastructure
##### (b) Purpose; sense of Congress

(1) Purpose

The purposes of this section are

(A) to encourage the expansion and extension of middle mile infrastructure to reduce the cost of connecting unserved and underserved areas to the backbone of the internet (commonly referred to as the “last mile”); and

(B) to promote broadband connection resiliency through the creation of alternative network connection paths that can be designed to prevent single points of failure on a broadband network.

(2) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(A) in awarding middle mile grants, the Assistant Secretary should give priority to

(i) projects that leverage existing rights-of-way, assets, and infrastructure to minimize financial, regulatory, and permitting challenges;

(ii) projects in which the eligible entity designs the route of the middle mile infrastructure to enable the connection of unserved anchor institutions, including Tribal anchor institutions; and

(iii) projects that facilitate the development of carrier-neutral interconnection facilities; and

(iv) projects that

(I) improve the redundancy and resiliency of existing middle mile infrastructure; and

(II) reduce regulatory and permitting barriers to promote the construction of new middle mile infrastructure; and

(B) a regulated utility should use funds received from a middle mile grant as a supplement to the core utility capital investment plan of the regulated utility to

(i) facilitate increased broadband resiliency or redundancy of existing middle mile infrastructure; or

(ii) provide connectivity to unserved areas and underserved areas within the service territory of the utility and nearby communities.
