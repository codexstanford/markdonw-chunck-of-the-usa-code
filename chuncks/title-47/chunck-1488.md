#### § 1741. Enabling middle mile broadband infrastructure
##### (e) Eligibility

(1) Prioritization

To be eligible to obtain a middle mile grant, an eligible entity shall agree, in the application submitted through the process established under subsection (d), to prioritize

(A) connecting middle mile infrastructure to last mile networks that provide or plan to provide broadband service to households in unserved areas;

(B) connecting non-contiguous trust lands; or

(C) the offering of wholesale broadband service at reasonable rates on a carrier-neutral basis.

(2) Buildout timeline

Subject to paragraph (5), to be eligible to obtain a middle mile grant, an eligible entity shall agree, in the application submitted through the process established under subsection (d), to complete buildout of the middle mile infrastructure described in the application by not later than 5 years after the date on which amounts from the grant are made available to the eligible entity.

(3) Project eligibility requirements

(A) Capability to support retail broadband service

A project shall be eligible for a middle mile grant if, at the time of the application, the Assistant Secretary determines that the proposed middle mile broadband network will be capable of supporting retail broadband service.

(B) Mapping data

(i) Use of most recent data

In mapping out gaps in broadband coverage, an eligible entity that uses a middle mile grant to build out terrestrial or fixed wireless middle mile infrastructure shall use the most recent broadband mapping data available from one of the following sources:

(I) The FCC fixed broadband map.

(II) The State in which the area that will be served by the middle mile infrastructure is located, or the Tribal government with jurisdiction over the area that will be served by the middle mile infrastructure (if applicable).

(III) Speed and usage surveys of existing broadband service that

(aa) demonstrate that more than 25 percent of the respondents display a broadband service speed that is slower than the speeds required for an area to qualify as unserved; and

(bb) are conducted by

(AA) the eligible entity;

(BB) the State in which the area that will be served by the middle mile infrastructure is located; or

(CC) the Tribal government with jurisdiction over the area that will be served by the middle mile infrastructure (if applicable).

(ii) Sharing facility locations

(I) Definition

In this clause, the term “covered recipient”, with respect to an eligible entity, means

(aa) the Assistant Secretary;

(bb) the Commission;

(cc) the Tribal government with jurisdiction over the area that will be served by the middle mile infrastructure (if applicable); and

(dd) the State broadband office for the State in which the area that will be served by the middle mile infrastructure is located.

(II) Provision of information

Subject to subclauses (III) and (IV), an eligible entity that constructs, improves, or acquires middle mile infrastructure using a middle mile grant shall share with each covered recipient the location of all the middle mile broadband infrastructure.

(III) Format

An eligible entity shall provide the information required under subclause (II) to each covered recipient in a uniform format determined by the Assistant Secretary.

(IV) Protection of information

(aa) In general

The information provided by an eligible entity under subclause (II) may only be used for purposes of carrying out the grant program under subsection (c) and any reporting related thereto.

(bb) Legal defenses

(AA) In general

A covered recipient may not receive information under subclause (II) unless the covered recipient agrees in writing to assert all available legal defenses to the disclosure of the information if a person or entity seeks disclosure from the covered recipient under any Federal, State, or local public disclosure law.

(BB) Rule of construction

Nothing in subitem (AA) is intended to be or shall be construed as a waiver of Tribal sovereign immunity.

(C) Connection to anchor institutions

To the extent feasible, an eligible entity that receives a middle mile grant to build middle mile infrastructure using fiber optic technology shall

(i) ensure that the proposed middle mile broadband network will be capable of providing broadband to an anchor institution at a speed of not less than

(I) 1 gigabit per second for downloads; and

(II) 1 gigabit per second for uploads to an anchor institution; and

(ii) include direct interconnect facilities that will facilitate the provision of broadband service to anchor institutions located within 1,000 feet of the middle mile infrastructure.

(D) Interconnection and nondiscrimination

(i) In general

An eligible entity that receives a middle mile grant to build a middle mile project using fiber optic technology shall offer interconnection in perpetuity, where technically feasible without exceeding current or reasonably anticipated capacity limitations, on reasonable rates and terms to be negotiated with requesting parties.

(ii) Nature of interconnection

The interconnection required to be offered under clause (i) includes both the ability to connect to the public internet and physical interconnection for the exchange of traffic.

(iii) Inclusion in application

An applicant for a middle mile grant shall disclose the applicant’s proposed interconnection, nondiscrimination, and network management practices in the application submitted through the process established under subsection (d).

(4) Accountability

The Assistant Secretary shall

(A) establish sufficient transparency, accountability, reporting, and oversight measures for the grant program established under subsection (c) to deter waste, fraud, and abuse of program funds; and

(B) establish

(i) buildout requirements for each eligible entity that receives a middle mile grant, which shall require the completion of a certain percentage of project miles by a certain date; and

(ii) penalties, which may include rescission of funds, for grantees that do not meet requirements described in clause (i) or the deadline under paragraph (2).

(5) Extensions

(A) In general

At the request of an eligible entity, the Assistant Secretary may extend the buildout deadline under paragraph (2) by not more than 1 year if the eligible entity certifies that

(i) the eligible entity has a plan for use of the middle mile grant;

(ii) the project to build out middle mile infrastructure is underway; or

(iii) extenuating circumstances require an extension of time to allow completion of the project to build out middle mile infrastructure.

(B) Effect on interim buildout requirements

If the Assistant Secretary grants an extension under subparagraph (A), the Assistant Secretary shall modify any buildout requirements established under paragraph (4)(B)(i) as necessary.
