#### § 342. Process for issuing qualified carrier certification
##### (a) Certification

The Commission shall issue a certification for the purposes of section 119(g)(3)(A)(iii)  1 of title 17 if the Commission determines that

(1) a satellite carrier is providing local service pursuant to the statutory license under section 122 of such title in each designated market area; and

(2) with respect to each designated market area in which such satellite carrier was not providing such local service as of the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010

(A) the satellite carrier’s satellite beams are designed, and predicted by the satellite manufacturer’s pre-launch test data, to provide a good quality satellite signal to at least 90 percent of the households in each such designated market area based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census Bureau; and

(B) there is no material evidence that there has been a satellite or sub-system failure subsequent to the satellite’s launch that precludes the ability of the satellite carrier to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A).
