### CHAPTER 5— WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION
#### § 338. Carriage of local television signals by satellite carriers
##### (l) Market determinations

(1) In general

Following a written request, the Commission may, with respect to a particular commercial television broadcast station, include additional communities within its local market or exclude communities from such station’s local market to better effectuate the purposes of this section.

(2) Considerations

In considering requests filed under paragraph (1), the Commission

(A) may determine that particular communities are part of more than one local market; and

(B) shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as

(i) whether the station, or other stations located in the same area

(I) have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community; or

(II) have been historically carried on the satellite carrier or carriers serving such community;

(ii) whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community;

(iii) whether modifying the local market of the television station would promote consumers’ access to television broadcast station signals that originate in their State of residence;

(iv) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a satellite carrier in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community; and

(v) evidence of viewing patterns in households that subscribe and do not subscribe to the services offered by multichannel video programming distributors within the areas served by such multichannel video programming distributors in such community.

(3) Carriage of signals

(A) Carriage obligation

A market determination under this subsection shall not create additional carriage obligations for a satellite carrier if it is not technically and economically feasible for such carrier to accomplish such carriage by means of its satellites in operation at the time of the determination.

(B) Deletion of signals

A satellite carrier shall not delete from carriage the signal of a commercial television broadcast station during the pendency of any proceeding under this subsection.

(4) Determinations

Not later than 120 days after the date that a written request is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall grant or deny the request.

(5) No effect on eligibility to receive distant signals

No modification of a commercial television broadcast station’s local market pursuant to this subsection shall have any effect on the eligibility of households in the community affected by such modification to receive distant signals pursuant to section 339 of this title , notwithstanding subsection (h)(1) of this section.
