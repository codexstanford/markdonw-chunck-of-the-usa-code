##### (a) Reverse auction to identify incentive amount

(1) In general

The Commission shall conduct a reverse auction to determine the amount of compensation that each broadcast television licensee would accept in return for voluntarily relinquishing some or all of its broadcast television spectrum usage rights in order to make spectrum available for assignment through a system of competitive bidding under subparagraph (G) of section 309(j)(8) of this title .

(2) Eligible relinquishments

A relinquishment of usage rights for purposes of paragraph (1) shall include the following:

(A) Relinquishing all usage rights with respect to a particular television channel without receiving in return any usage rights with respect to another television channel.

(B) Relinquishing all usage rights with respect to an ultra high frequency television channel in return for receiving usage rights with respect to a very high frequency television channel.

(C) Relinquishing usage rights in order to share a television channel with another licensee.

(3) Confidentiality

The Commission shall take all reasonable steps necessary to protect the confidentiality of Commission-held data of a licensee participating in the reverse auction under paragraph (1), including withholding the identity of such licensee until the reassignments and reallocations (if any) under subsection (b)(1)(B) become effective, as described in subsection (f)(2).

(4) Protection of carriage rights of licensees sharing a channel

A broadcast television station that voluntarily relinquishes spectrum usage rights under this subsection in order to share a television channel and that possessed carriage rights under section 338, 534, or 535 of this title on November 30, 2010 , shall have, at its shared location, the carriage rights under such section that would apply to such station at such location if it were not sharing a channel.
