### CHAPTER 8— NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION
#### § 923. Identification of reallocable frequencies
##### (g) Relocation of and spectrum sharing by Federal Government stations

(1) Eligible Federal entities

Any Federal entity that operates a Federal Government station that incurs relocation or sharing costs because of planning for an auction of eligible spectrum frequencies or the reallocation of eligible spectrum frequencies from Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use shall receive payment for such relocation or sharing costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance with this section and section 928 of this title . For purposes of this paragraph, Federal power agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) that choose to relocate from the frequencies identified for reallocation pursuant to subsection (a) are eligible to receive payment under this paragraph.

(2) Eligible frequencies

The bands of eligible frequencies for purposes of this section are as follows:

(A) the 216–220 megahertz band, the 1432–1435 megahertz band, the 1710–1755 megahertz band, and the 2385–2390 megahertz band of frequencies; and

(B) any other band of frequencies reallocated from Federal use to non-Federal use or to shared use after January 1, 2003 , that is assigned by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 ( 47 U.S.C. 309(j) ).

(3) Relocation or sharing costs defined

(A) In general

For purposes of this section and section 928 of this title , the term “relocation or sharing costs” means the costs incurred by a Federal entity in connection with the auction of spectrum frequencies or the sharing of spectrum frequencies (including the auction or a planned auction of the rights to use spectrum frequencies on a shared basis with such entity) in order to achieve comparable capability of systems as before the relocation or sharing arrangement. Such term includes, with respect to relocation or sharing, as the case may be

(i) the costs of any modification or replacement of equipment, spares, associated ancillary equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, training, or compliance with regulations that are attributable to relocation or sharing;

(ii) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software, site acquisition, and construction, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expense, including term-limited Federal civil servant and contractor staff necessary to carry out the relocation or sharing activities of a Federal entity, and reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal entity that are attributable to relocation or sharing, including increased recurring costs associated with the replacement of facilities;

(iii) the costs of research, engineering studies, economic analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with

(I) calculating the estimated relocation or sharing costs that are provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (4)(A);

(II) determining the technical or operational feasibility of relocation to 1 or more potential relocation bands; or

(III) planning for or managing a relocation or sharing arrangement (including spectrum coordination with auction winners);

(iv) the one-time costs of any modification of equipment reasonably necessary

(I) to accommodate non-Federal use of shared frequencies; or

(II) in the case of eligible frequencies reallocated for exclusive non-Federal use and assigned through a system of competitive bidding under section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 ( 47 U.S.C. 309(j) ) but with respect to which a Federal entity retains primary allocation or protected status for a period of time after the completion of the competitive bidding process, to accommodate shared Federal and non-Federal use of such frequencies for such period; and

(v) the costs associated with the accelerated replacement of systems and equipment if the acceleration is necessary to ensure the timely relocation of systems to a new frequency assignment or the timely accommodation of sharing of Federal frequencies.

(B) Comparable capability of systems

For purposes of subparagraph (A), comparable capability of systems

(i) may be achieved by relocating a Federal Government station to a new frequency assignment, by relocating a Federal Government station to a different geographic location, by modifying Federal Government equipment to mitigate interference or use less spectrum, in terms of bandwidth, geography, or time, and thereby permitting spectrum sharing (including sharing among relocated Federal entities and incumbents to make spectrum available for non-Federal use) or relocation, or by utilizing an alternative technology; and

(ii) includes the acquisition of state-of-the-art replacement systems intended to meet comparable operational scope, which may include incidental increases in functionality.

(4) Notice to Commission of estimated relocation or sharing costs

(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18 months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligible frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months prior to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA, on behalf of the Federal entities and after review by the Office of Management and Budget, shall notify the Commission of estimated relocation or sharing costs and timelines for such relocation or sharing.

(B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA shall provide such entity with information regarding an alternative frequency assignment or assignments to which their radiocommunications operations could be relocated for purposes of calculating the estimated relocation or sharing costs and timelines to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to subparagraph (A).

(C) To the extent practicable and consistent with national security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the geographic location of the Federal entities’ facilities or systems and the frequency bands used by such facilities or systems.

(5) Notice to congressional committees and GAO

The NTIA shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of relocation or sharing costs to the Commission under paragraph (4)(A), submit to  1 Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a copy of such estimate and the timelines for relocation or sharing. Unless disapproved within 30 days, the estimate shall be approved. If disapproved, the NTIA may resubmit a revised initial estimate.

(6) Implementation of procedures

The NTIA shall take such actions as necessary to ensure the timely relocation of Federal entities’ spectrum-related operations from frequencies described in paragraph (2) to frequencies or facilities of comparable capability and to ensure the timely implementation of arrangements for the sharing of frequencies described in such paragraph. Upon a finding by the NTIA that a Federal entity has achieved comparable capability of systems, the NTIA shall terminate or limit the entity’s authorization and notify the Commission that the entity’s relocation has been completed or sharing arrangement has been implemented. The NTIA shall also terminate such entity’s authorization if the NTIA determines that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with the timeline for relocation or sharing submitted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under section 928(d)(2)(C) of this title .
