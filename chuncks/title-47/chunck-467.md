(F) procedures for the receipt and review of interference complaints on an expedited basis consistent with paragraph (5)(D).

(4) A low-power television station to which this subsection applies may not provide digital data service unless

(A) the provision of that service, including any remote return-path transmission in the case of 2-way digital data service, does not cause any interference in violation of the Commission’s existing rules, regarding interference caused by low power television stations to full-service analog or digital television stations, class A television stations, or television translator stations; and
