### CHAPTER 2— COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER
#### § 201. Ownership of copyright
###### (c) Contributions to Collective Works .

Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.
