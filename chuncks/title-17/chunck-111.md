### CHAPTER 2— COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER
#### § 205. Recordation of transfers and other documents
###### (e) Priority Between Conflicting Transfer of Ownership and Nonexclusive License .

A nonexclusive license, whether recorded or not, prevails over a conflicting transfer of copyright ownership if the license is evidenced by a written instrument signed by the owner of the rights licensed or such owner’s duly authorized agent, and if

(1) the license was taken before execution of the transfer; or

(2) the license was taken in good faith before recordation of the transfer and without notice of it.
