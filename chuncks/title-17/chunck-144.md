### CHAPTER 4— COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DEPOSIT, AND REGISTRATION
#### § 406. Notice of copyright: Error in name or date on certain copies and phonorecords
###### (b) Error in Date .

When the year date in the notice on copies or phonorecords distributed before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 by authority of the copyright owner is earlier than the year in which publication first occurred, any period computed from the year of first publication under section 302 is to be computed from the year in the notice. Where the year date is more than one year later than the year in which publication first occurred, the work is considered to have been published without any notice and is governed by the provisions of section 405.
