### CHAPTER 2— COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER
#### § 205. Recordation of transfers and other documents
###### (d) Priority Between Conflicting Transfers .

As between two conflicting transfers, the one executed first prevails if it is recorded, in the manner required to give constructive notice under subsection (c), within one month after its execution in the United States or within two months after its execution outside the United States, or at any time before recordation in such manner of the later transfer. Otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such manner, and if taken in good faith, for valuable consideration or on the basis of a binding promise to pay royalties, and without notice of the earlier transfer.
