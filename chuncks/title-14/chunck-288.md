### CHAPTER 11— ACQUISITIONS
#### § 1132. Acquisition
###### (d) Test and Evaluation Master Plan.

(1) In general .

For any Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program the Chief Acquisition Officer must approve a test and evaluation master plan specific to the acquisition project or program for the capability, asset, or subsystems of the capability or asset and intended to minimize technical, cost, and schedule risk as early as practicable in the development of the project or program.

(2) Test and evaluation strategy .

The master plan shall

(A) set forth an integrated test and evaluation strategy that will verify that capability-level or asset-level and subsystem-level design and development, including performance and supportability, have been sufficiently proven before the capability, asset, or subsystem of the capability or asset is approved for production; and

(B) require that adequate developmental tests and evaluations and operational tests and evaluations established under subparagraph (A) are performed to inform production decisions.

(3) Other components of the master plan .

At a minimum, the master plan shall identify

(A) the key performance parameters to be resolved through the integrated test and evaluation strategy;

(B) the performance data to be used to determine whether the key performance parameters have been resolved;

(C) critical operational issues to be assessed in addition to the key performance parameters;

(D) the results during test and evaluation that will be required to demonstrate that a capability, asset, or subsystem meets performance requirements;

(E) specific development test and evaluation phases and the scope of each phase;

(F) modeling and simulation activities to be performed, if any, and the scope of such activities;

(G) early operational assessments to be performed, if any, and the scope of such assessments;

(H) operational test and evaluation phases;

(I) an estimate of the resources, including funds, that will be required for all test, evaluation, assessment, modeling, and simulation activities; and

(J) the Government entity or independent entity that will perform the test, evaluation, assessment, modeling, and simulation activities.

(4) Update .

The Chief Acquisition Officer must approve an updated master plan whenever there is a revision to project or program test and evaluation strategy, scope, or phasing.

(5) Limitation .

The Coast Guard may not

(A) proceed beyond that phase of the acquisition process that entails approving the supporting acquisition of a capability or asset before the master plan is approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer; or

(B) award any production contract for a capability, asset, or subsystem for which a master plan is required under this subsection before the master plan is approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer.
