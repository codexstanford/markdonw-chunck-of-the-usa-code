(2) three years in the grade of lieutenant;

(3) four years in the grade of lieutenant commander;

(4) four years in the grade of commander; and

(b) For the purpose of this section, service in a grade includes all qualifying service in that grade or a higher grade, under either a temporary or permanent appointment. However, service in a grade under a temporary service appointment under section 2125 of this title is considered as service only in the grade that the officer concerned would have held had he not been so appointed.
