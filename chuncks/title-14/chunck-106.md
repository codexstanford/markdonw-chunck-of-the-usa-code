#### § 526. Stopping vessels; indemnity for firing at or into vessel

(a)

(1) Whenever any vessel liable to seizure or examination does not stop on being ordered to do so or on being pursued by an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft which has displayed the ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia prescribed for an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft, the individual in command or in charge of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft may, subject to paragraph (2), fire at or into the vessel which does not stop.

(2) Before firing at or into a vessel as authorized in paragraph (1), the individual in command or in charge of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft shall fire a gun as a warning signal, except that the prior firing of a gun as a warning signal is not required if that individual determines that the firing of a warning signal would unreasonably endanger individuals or property in the vicinity of the vessel to be stopped.

(b) The individual in command of an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft and all individuals acting under that individual’s direction shall be indemnified from any penalties or actions for damages for firing at or into a vessel pursuant to subsection (a). If any individual is killed or wounded by the firing, and the individual in command of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft or any individual acting pursuant to their orders is prosecuted or arrested therefor, they shall be forthwith admitted to bail.
