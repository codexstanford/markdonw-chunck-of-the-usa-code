In any case in which a covered beneficiary (as defined in section 1072(5) of title 10 ) resides on an island that is located in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia and that lacks public access roads to the mainland, the Secretary shall reimburse the reasonable travel expenses of the covered beneficiary and, when accompaniment by an adult is necessary, for a parent or guardian of the covered beneficiary or another member of the covered beneficiary’s family who is at least 21 years of age, if

(1) the covered beneficiary is referred by a primary care physician to a specialty care provider (as defined in section 1074i(b) of title 10 ) on the mainland who provides services less than 100 miles from the location where the beneficiary resides; or

(2) the Coast Guard medical regional manager for the area in which such island is located determines that the covered beneficiary requires services of a primary care, specialty care, or dental provider and such a provider who is part of the network of providers of a TRICARE program (as that term is defined in section 1072(7) of title 10 ) does not practice on such island.
