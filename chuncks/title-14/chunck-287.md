### CHAPTER 11— ACQUISITIONS
#### § 1132. Acquisition
###### (c) Analysis of Alternatives.

(1) In general .

The Coast Guard may not acquire an experimental or technically immature capability or asset or implement a Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program, unless it has prepared an analysis of alternatives for the capability or asset to be acquired in the concept and technology development phase of the acquisition process for the capability or asset.

(2) Requirements .

The analysis of alternatives shall be prepared by a federally funded research and development center, a qualified entity of the Department of Defense, or a similar independent third-party entity that has appropriate acquisition expertise and has no financial interest in any part of the acquisition project or program that is the subject of the analysis. At a minimum, the analysis of alternatives shall include

(A) an assessment of the technical maturity of the capability or asset, and technical and other risks;

(B) an examination of capability, interoperability, and other advantages and disadvantages;

(C) an evaluation of whether different combinations or quantities of specific assets or capabilities could meet the Coast Guard’s overall performance needs;

(D) a discussion of key assumptions and variables, and sensitivity to change in such assumptions and variables;

(E) when an alternative is an existing capability, asset, or prototype, an evaluation of relevant safety and performance records and costs;

(F) a calculation of life-cycle costs including

(i) an examination of likely research and development costs and the levels of uncertainty associated with such estimated costs;

(ii) an examination of likely production and deployment costs and the levels of uncertainty associated with such estimated costs;

(iii) an examination of likely operating and support costs and the levels of uncertainty associated with such estimated costs;

(iv) if they are likely to be significant, an examination of likely disposal costs and the levels of uncertainty associated with such estimated costs; and

(v) such additional measures as the Commandant or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating determines to be necessary for appropriate evaluation of the capability or asset; and

(G) the business case for each viable alternative.
