(B) will remain in that reserve component until completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet.

The period of time for which a cadet is ordered to active duty under this paragraph may be determined without regard to section 651(a) of title 10 .

(2) A cadet who is transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve under paragraph (1) shall be transferred in an appropriate enlisted grade or rating, as determined by the Secretary.
