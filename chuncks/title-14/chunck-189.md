These lease agreements may provide for a cancellation payment to be made. Amounts that were originally obligated for the cost of the contract may be used for cancellation or termination costs.

(b) For purposes of this section, the term “special purpose facilities” means any facilities used to carry out Coast Guard aviation, maritime, or navigation missions other than general purpose office and storage space facilities.
