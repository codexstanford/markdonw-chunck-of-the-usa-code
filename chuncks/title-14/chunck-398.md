#### § 2118. Selection boards; submission of reports

(a) A board convened under section 2106 of this title shall submit its report to the Secretary. If the board has acted contrary to law or regulation, the Secretary may return the report for proceedings in revision and resubmission to the Secretary. After his final review, the Secretary shall submit the report of the board to the President for his approval, modification, or disapproval.

(b) If any officer recommended for promotion is not acceptable to the President, the President may remove the name of that officer from the report of the board.

(c) Upon approval by the President the names of officers selected for promotion by a board convened under section 2106 of this title shall be promptly disseminated to the service at large.

(d) Except as required by this section, the proceedings of a selection board, including a special selection board convened under section 2120, shall not be disclosed to any individual who is not a member of the board.

(e) If the Secretary makes a recommendation under this section that the name of an officer be removed from a report of a selection board and the recommendation is accompanied by information that was not presented to that selection board, that information shall be made available to that officer. The officer shall then be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit comments on that information to the officials making the recommendation and the officials reviewing the recommendation. If an eligible officer cannot be given access to such information because of its classification status, the officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be provided with an appropriate summary of the information.
