#### § 907. Long-term lease of special purpose facilities
###### (c) In the case of ATON, VTS, or NDS sites, the Secretary may enter into multiyear lease agreements under subsection (a) of this section whenever the Secretary finds that

(1) the use of such a lease agreement will promote the efficiency of the ATON, VTS, or NDS programs and will result in reduced total costs under the agreement;

(2) the minimum need for the real property or interest therein to be leased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated lease period; and

(3) the estimates of both the cost of the lease and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear lease are realistic.
