#### § 508. Costs incurred in the modification of structures
##### (c) Reimbursement of certain modification costs

With respect to the additional amounts authorized to be appropriated by section 509 of this title , costs incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes, shall be reimbursed to the extent provided in this subsection.

(1) Fifteen percent of such costs shall be allocated to the authorized purposes of the structure, except that in the case of Jackson Lake Dam, Minidoka Project, Idaho-Wyoming, such costs shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation of operation and maintenance charges.

(2) Costs allocated to irrigation water service and capable of being repaid by the irrigation water users shall be reimbursed within 50 years of the year in which the work undertaken pursuant to this subchapter is substantially complete. Costs allocated to irrigation water service which are beyond the water users’ ability to pay shall be reimbursed in accordance with existing law.

(3) Costs allocated to recreation or fish and wildlife enhancement shall be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Water Project Recreation Act ( 79 Stat. 213 ), as amended [ 16 U.S.C. 460 l –12 et seq.].

(4) Costs allocated to the purpose of municipal, industrial, and miscellaneous water service, commercial power, and the portion of recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement costs reimbursable under the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [ 16 U.S.C. 460 l –12 et seq.], shall be repaid within 50 years with interest. The interest rate used shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the applicable reimbursement period during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred. To the extent that more than one interest rate is determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an interest rate at the weighted average of the rates so determined.
