(C) Exception for the State of Louisiana

For the purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii), the coastline for coastal political subdivisions in the State of Louisiana without a coastline shall be considered to be ⅓ the average length of the coastline of all coastal political subdivisions with a coastline in the State of Louisiana.

(C) Waiver
