A Village Corporation’s obligation to reconvey lands under section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1613(c) ] shall arise only upon receipt of an interim conveyance or patent, whichever is earlier, under subsection (c) of this section or under such Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.]. For purposes of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], legislative conveyances made by, or interim conveyances and patents issued pursuant to, this title shall have the same effect as if issued pursuant to sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(f), and 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1613(a) , 1613(b), 1613(f), and 1618(b)] and shall be deemed to have been so issued. Disputes between or among Native Corporations arising from conveyances under this Act shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators of a type described in section 12(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1611(e) ] pertaining to disputes over land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations.
