### CHAPTER 33— ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
#### § 1617. Revocation of Indian allotment authority in Alaska
##### (e) Native allotment revisions on land selected by or conveyed to a Native Corporation

(1) An allotment applicant who had an application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971 , and whose application is still open on the records of the Department of the Interior as of December 10, 2004 , may revise the land description in the application to describe land other than the land that the applicant originally intended to claim if

(A) the application

(i) describes land selected by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation formed to receive benefits under this chapter; or

(ii) otherwise conflicts with an interest in land granted to a Native Corporation by the United States;

(B) the revised land description describes land selected by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation of approximately equal acreage in substitution for the land described in the original application;

(C) the Director of the Bureau of Land Management has not adopted a final plan of survey for the final entitlement of the Native Corporation or its successor in interest; and

(D) the Native Corporation that selected the land or its successor in interest provides a corporate resolution authorizing reconveyance or relinquishment to the United States of the land, or interest in land, described in the revised application.

(2) The land description in an allotment application may not be revised under this section unless the Secretary has determined

(A) that the allotment application is valid or would have been approved under section 1634 of this title had the land in the allotment application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 1980 ;

(B) in consultation with the administering agency, that the proposed revision would not create an isolated inholding within a conservation system unit (as defined in section 3102 of title 16 ); and

(C) that the proposed revision will facilitate completion of a land transfer in the State.

(3)

(A) On obtaining title evidence acceptable under Department of Justice title standards and acceptance of a reconveyance or relinquishment from a Native Corporation under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall issue a Native allotment certificate to the applicant for the land reconveyed or relinquished by the Native Corporation.

(B) Any allotment revised under this section shall, when allotted, be made subject to any easement, trail, right-of-way, or any third-party interest (other than a fee interest) in existence on the revised allotment land on the date of revision.
