### CHAPTER 33— ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
#### § 1629c. Duration of alienability restrictions
##### (c) Recapitalization procedure
######## (B) An amendment or amendments submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) (and any subsequent amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (C)) may provide for the maintenance or extension of alienability restrictions for

(i) an indefinite period of time;

(ii) a specified period of time not to exceed fifty years; or

(iii) a period of time that shall end upon the occurrence of a specified event.

(C) If an amendment or amendments approved pursuant to subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph maintains or extends alienability restrictions for a specified period of time, termination of the restrictions at the close of such period may be postponed if a further amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation is approved to extend the restrictions. There shall be no limit on the number of such amendments that can be approved. Such amendments shall not be effective to extend the restrictions unless approved prior to the expiration of the period of maintenance or extension then in force.

(D) The board of directors may ask the shareholders to approve en bloc pursuant to a single vote a series of amendments (including an amendment to authorize the issuance of stock pursuant to section 1606(g) of this title ) to implement a recapitalization plan that includes a provision maintaining alienability restrictions.

(2)

(A) If an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation maintaining or extending alienability restrictions for a specified period of time is approved pursuant to paragraph (1), the restrictions shall automatically terminate at the end of such period unless the restrictions are extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1)(C).

(B)

(i) A Native Corporation that approves an amendment to its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) to maintain or extend alienability restrictions for an indefinite period may later amend its articles to terminate such restrictions. Such amendment shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which the restrictions shall terminate.

(ii) Rejection of an amendment described in clause (i) by the shareholders shall not preclude consideration of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.

(3) If a recapitalization plan approved pursuant to paragraph (1) distributes voting alienable common stock to each holder of shares of Settlement Common Stock (issued pursuant to section 1606(g)(1)(A) of this title ) that carries aggregate dividend and liquidation rights equivalent to those carried by such shares of Settlement Common Stock (except for rights to distributions made pursuant to sections 1606(j) and 1606(m) of this title) upon completion of the recapitalization plan, then such holder shall have no right under section 1629d of this title and any other provision of law to further compensation from the corporation with respect to action taken pursuant to this subsection.
