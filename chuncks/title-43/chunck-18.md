#### § 31c. Geologic mapping program
##### (c) Program objectives

The objectives of the geologic mapping program shall include

(1) determining the Nation’s geologic framework through systematic development of geologic maps at scales appropriate to the geologic setting and the perceived applications, such maps to be contributed to the national geologic map data base;

(2) development of a complementary national geochronologic and paleontologic data base that provides value-added descriptive and interpretative information to the geologic-map data base;

(3) application of cost-effective mapping techniques that assemble, produce, translate and disseminate geologic-map information and that render such information of greater application and benefit to the public; and

(4) development of public awareness of the role and application of geologic-map information to the resolution of national issues of land use management.
