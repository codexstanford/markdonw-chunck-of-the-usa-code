#### § 2424. Defaults
##### (c) Payment of principal and interest by Secretary

With respect to any obligation guaranteed under this section, the Secretary may enter into a contract to pay, and pay, holders of the obligation, for and on behalf of the non-Federal borrower, from funds appropriated for that purpose, the principal and interest payments that become due and payable on the unpaid balance of the obligation if the Secretary finds that

(1)

(A) the non-Federal borrower is unable to meet the payments and is not in default;

(B) it is in the public interest to permit the non-Federal borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of the project; and

(C) the probable net benefit to the Federal Government in paying the principal and interest will be greater than that which would result in the event of a default;

(2) the amount of the payment that the Secretary is authorized to pay shall be no greater than the amount of principal and interest that the non-Federal borrower is obligated to pay under the agreement being guaranteed; and

(3) the borrower agrees to reimburse the Secretary for the payment (including interest) on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Secretary.
