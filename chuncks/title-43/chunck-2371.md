### CHAPTER 49— NATIONAL LANDSLIDE PREPAREDNESS
#### § 3102. National Landslide Hazards Reduction Program
##### (b) Description of program

(1) Program activities

The Secretary, in coordination with the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Landslide Hazards established by subsection (c)(1) (referred to in this section as the “Committee”) and in coordination with existing activities of the United States Geological Survey and other Federal agencies, shall

(A) identify, map, assess, and research landslide hazards;

(B) respond to landslide events; and

(C) in coordination with State offices, units of local government, territories, and Indian tribes

(i) establish working groups with State offices, units of local government, territories, and Indian tribes to identify regional and local priorities for researching, identifying, mapping, and assessing landslide hazards; and

(ii) develop and implement landslide hazard guidelines for

(I) geologists;

(II) geological and geotechnical engineers;

(III) emergency management personnel; and

(IV) land use and other decisionmakers.

(2) National strategy

Not later than 1 year after January 5, 2021 , and every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary, in coordination with the Committee, shall develop and publish a national strategy for landslide hazards, risk reduction, and response in the United States (including territories), which shall include

(A) goals and priorities for the program;

(B) priorities for data acquisition, research, communications, and risk management on landslides and landslide hazards across relevant Federal agencies; and

(C) a detailed interagency plan, which shall take into consideration national disaster preparedness, response, and recovery frameworks, to carry out the national strategy, including details about the programs, projects, and budgets that will be used to implement the national strategy.

(3) National landslide hazards database

In carrying out the program, the Secretary, in coordination with State offices, units of local government, territories, and Indian tribes, shall develop and maintain a publicly accessible national landslide hazard and risk inventory database to compile, maintain, standardize, and evaluate data regarding

(A) landslide hazards and risks;

(B) the impact of landslides on

(i) health and safety;

(ii) the economy and infrastructure; and

(iii) the environment;

(C) landslide hazard stabilization; and

(D) reduction of losses from landslides.

(4) Landslide hazard and risk preparedness for communities

In carrying out the program, the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Transportation, and the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, and in consultation with State offices, units of local government, territories, and Indian tribes, shall develop and disseminate

(A) landslide planning and risk reduction guidance, guidelines, maps, tools, and training materials to help inform State, territorial, local, and Tribal governments and decisionmakers with respect to

(i) the use and implementation of landslide hazard assessments;

(ii) the applied use of the database developed under paragraph (3);

(iii) reducing losses from landslides; and

(iv) resources available for communities working to improve landslide hazard preparedness; and

(B) landslide preparedness curricula and training modules for

(i) State, territorial, local, and Tribal officials;

(ii) Federal, State, territorial, local, and Tribal emergency managers; and

(iii) the National Guard.

(5) Debris flow early warning system

In carrying out the program, the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall expand the early warning system for debris flow by

(A) expanding the early warning system for post-wildfire debris flow to include recently burned areas across the western United States;

(B) developing procedures with State, territorial, local, and Tribal governments to monitor stormwater drainage in areas with high debris flow risk; and

(C) identifying high-risk debris flow areas, such as recently burned land and potential lahar hazard areas.

(6) Emergency response activities

In carrying out the program, the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, States offices, units of local government, territories, and Indian tribes, shall establish and support emergency response procedures for the rapid deployment of Federal scientists, equipment, and services to areas impacted by a significant landslide event

(A) to support emergency response efforts and improve the safety of emergency responders;

(B) to improve data collection; and

(C) to conduct research to advance the understanding of the causes, impacts, and reduction of landslide hazards and risks.
