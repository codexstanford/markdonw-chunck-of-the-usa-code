#### § 31k. National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System
##### (b) National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System

(1) Establishment

(A) In general

The Secretary shall establish within the United States Geological Survey a system, to be known as the “National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System”, to monitor, warn, and protect citizens of the United States from undue and avoidable harm from volcanic activity.

(B) Purposes

The purposes of the System are

(i) to organize, modernize, standardize, and stabilize the monitoring systems of the volcano observatories in the United States, which includes the Alaska Volcano Observatory, California Volcano Observatory, Cascades Volcano Observatory, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory;

(ii) to unify the monitoring systems of volcano observatories in the United States into a single interoperative system; and

(iii) to strengthen the warning and monitoring systems of volcano observatories in the United States by integrating relevant capacities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers located in Anchorage, Alaska, and Washington, D.C., to observe and model emissions of gases, aerosols, and ash, atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, and ocean chemistry resulting from volcanic eruptions.

(C) Objective

The objective of the System is to monitor all the volcanoes in the United States at a level commensurate with the threat posed by the volcanoes by

(i) upgrading existing networks on monitored volcanoes;

(ii) installing new networks on unmonitored volcanoes; and

(iii) employing geodetic and other components when applicable.

(2) System components

(A) In general

The System shall include

(i) a national volcano watch office that is operational 24 hours a day and 7 days a week;

(ii) a national volcano data center; and

(iii) an external grants program to support research in volcano monitoring science and technology.

(B) Modernization activities

Modernization activities under the System shall include the comprehensive application of emerging technologies, including digital broadband seismometers, real-time continuous Global Positioning System receivers, satellite and airborne radar interferometry, acoustic pressure sensors, spectrometry to measure gas emissions, and unoccupied aerial vehicles.

(C) Memorandum of understanding

The Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop and execute a memorandum of understanding to establish cooperative support for the activities of the System from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including environmental observations, modeling, and temporary duty assignments of personnel to support emergency activities, as necessary or appropriate.

(3) Management

(A) Management plan

(i) In general

Not later than 180 days after March 12, 2019 , the Secretary shall submit to Congress a 5-year management plan for establishing and operating the System.

(ii) Inclusions

The management plan submitted under clause (i) shall include

(I) annual cost estimates for modernization activities and operation of the System;

(II) annual milestones, standards, and performance goals; and

(III) recommendations for, and progress towards, establishing new, or enhancing existing, partnerships to leverage resources.

(iii) Update

(I) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cost estimates

The Secretary of Commerce shall submit to the Secretary annual cost estimates for modernization activities and support of the System for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

(II) Update of management plan

The Secretary shall update the management plan submitted under clause (i) to include the cost estimates submitted under subclause (I).

(B) Advisory committee

The Secretary shall establish an advisory committee to assist the Secretary in implementing the System, to be comprised of representatives of relevant agencies and members of the scientific community, to be appointed by the Secretary.

(C) Partnerships

The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with institutions of higher education and State agencies designating the institutions of higher education and State agencies as volcano observatory partners for the System.

(D) Coordination

The Secretary shall coordinate the activities under this section with the heads of relevant Federal agencies, including

(i) the Secretary of Transportation;

(ii) the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration;

(iii) the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and

(iv) the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

(E) Collaboration

The Secretary of Commerce shall collaborate with the Secretary to implement activities carried out under this section related to the expertise of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including observations and modeling of emissions of gases, aerosols, and ash, atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, and ocean chemistry resulting from volcanic eruptions.

(4) Annual report

Annually, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes the activities carried out under this section.
