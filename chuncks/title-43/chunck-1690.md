(A) Alienability restrictions imposed on Settlement Common Stock issued by a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection shall terminate on December 18, 1991 , unless extended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

(B)

(i) The board of directors of a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection shall, at least once prior to January 1, 1991 , approve, and submit to a vote of the shareholders, an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation to extend alienability restrictions. If the amendment is not approved by the shareholders, the board of directors may submit another such amendment to the shareholders once or more a year until December 18, 1991 .

(ii) In lieu of approving the amendment to the articles of incorporation described in clause (i) and submitting such amendment to a vote of the shareholders, at any time prior to January 1, 1991 , the board of directors of a Native Corporation that has approved a resolution described in paragraph (1)(A) may approve a new resolution rescinding that prior resolution. Upon approval of the new resolution rescinding a resolution described in paragraph (1)(A), the latter resolution shall be void and alienability restrictions on the Settlement Common Stock of such corporation shall continue subsequent to December 18, 1991 , until such time as the alienability restrictions are terminated pursuant to the procedure described in subsection (b).

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a civil action that challenges the constitutionality of any provision in clause (ii) shall be barred unless it is filed within one year after the date of the vote of the board of directors approving a resolution to rescind a prior opt-in election under paragraph (1)(A). Any such civil action shall be filed in accordance with section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments of 1987 ( 101 Stat. 1813–1814 ).
