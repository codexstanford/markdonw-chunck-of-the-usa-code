#### § 2212. Availability of water on temporary basis
##### (b) Special provisions applicable to temporary water supplies provided under this section

(1) Temporary supplies

Each temporary contract for the supply of water entered into pursuant to this section shall terminate no later than two years from the date of execution or upon a determination by the Secretary that water supply conditions no longer warrant that such contracts remain in effect, whichever occurs first. The costs associated with any such contract shall be repaid within the term of the contract.

(2) Ownership and acreage limitations

Lands not subject to Reclamation law that receive temporary irrigation water supplies under temporary contracts under this section shall not become subject to the ownership and acreage limitations or pricing provisions of Federal Reclamation law because of the delivery of such temporary water supplies. Lands that are subject to the ownership and acreage limitations of Federal Reclamation law shall not be exempted from those limitations because of the delivery of such temporary water supplies.

(3) Treatment under Reclamation Reform Act of 1982

No temporary contract entered into by the Secretary under this section shall be treated as a “contract” as that term is used in sections 203(a) and 220 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 ( Public Law 97–293 ) [ 43 U.S.C. 390cc(a) , 390tt].

(4) Amendments of existing contracts

Any amendment to an existing contract to allow a contractor to carry out the provisions of this subchapter shall not be considered a new and supplemental benefit for purposes of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 ( Public Law 97–293 ) [ 43 U.S.C. 390aa et seq.].
