### CHAPTER 33A— IMPLEMENTATION OF ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT AND ALASKA STATEHOOD
#### § 1635. State selections and conveyances
##### (k) Interim provisions

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on lands selected by, or granted or conveyed to, the State of Alaska under section 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act or this Act, but not yet tentatively approved to the State:

(1) The Secretary is authorized to make contracts and grant leases, licenses, permits, rights-of-way, or easements, and any tentative approval or patent shall be subject to such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement; except that (A) the authority granted the Secretary by this subsection is that authority the Secretary otherwise would have had under existing laws and regulations had the lands not been selected by the State, and (B) the State has concurred prior to such action by the Secretary.

(2) On and after December 2, 1980 , 90 per centum of any and all proceeds derived from contracts, leases, licenses, permits, rights-of-way, or easements or from trespasses originating after the date of selection by the State shall be held by the Secretary until such lands have been tentatively approved to the State. As such lands are tentatively approved, the Secretary shall pay to the State from such account the proceeds allocable to such lands which are derived from contracts, leases, licenses, permits, rights-of-way, easements, or trespasses. The proceeds derived from contracts, leases, licenses, permits, rights-of-way, easements or trespasses and deposited to the account pertaining to lands selected by the State but not tentatively approved due to rejection or relinquishment shall be paid as would have been required by law were it not for the provisions of this Act. In the event that the tentative approval does not cover all of the land embraced within any contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, easement, or trespass, the State shall only be entitled to the proportionate amount of the proceeds derived from such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement, which results from multiplying the total of such proceeds by a fraction in which the numerator is the acreage of such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement which is included in the tentative approval and the denominator is the total acreage contained in such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement; in the case of trespass, the State shall be entitled to the proportionate share of the proceeds in relation to the damages occurring on the respective lands.

(3) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve the State or the United States of any obligations under section 9 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ 43 U.S.C. 1608 ] or the fourth sentence of section 6(h) of the Alaska Statehood Act.
