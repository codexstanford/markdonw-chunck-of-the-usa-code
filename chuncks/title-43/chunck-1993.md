### CHAPTER 35— FEDERAL LAND POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
#### § 1761a. Streamlining the Forest Service process for consideration of communications facility location applications
##### (d) Additional considerations

In issuing regulations under subsection (b), the Secretary shall consider

(1) how discrete reviews in considering an application described in subsection (b)(1) can be conducted simultaneously, rather than sequentially, by any organizational units of the Forest Service that must approve the location or modification; and

(2) how to eliminate overlapping requirements among the organizational units of the Forest Service with respect to the location or modification of a communications facility on covered land administered by those organizational units.
