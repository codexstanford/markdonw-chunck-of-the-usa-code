The provisions of this section shall apply to any mineral lease covering submerged lands of the outer Continental Shelf issued by any State (including any extension, renewal, or replacement thereof heretofore granted pursuant to such lease or under the laws of such State) if

(1) such lease, or a true copy thereof, is filed with the Secretary by the lessee or his duly authorized agent within ninety days from August 7, 1953 , or within such further period or periods as provided in section 1336 of this title or as may be fixed from time to time by the Secretary;

(2) such lease was issued prior to December 21, 1948 , and would have been on June 5, 1950 , in force and effect in accordance with its terms and provisions and the law of the State issuing it had the State had the authority to issue such lease;

(3) there is filed with the Secretary, within the period or periods specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, (A) a certificate issued by the State official or agency having jurisdiction over such lease stating that it would have been in force and effect as required by the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, or (B) in the absence of such certificate, evidence in the form of affidavits, receipts, canceled checks, or other documents that may be required by the Secretary, sufficient to prove that such lease would have been so in force and effect;

(4) except as otherwise provided in section 1336 of this title hereof, all rents, royalties, and other sums payable under such lease between June 5, 1950 , and August 7, 1953 , which have not been paid in accordance with the provisions thereof, or to the Secretary or to the Secretary of the Navy, are paid to the Secretary within the period or periods specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and all rents, royalties, and other sums payable under such lease after August 7, 1953 , are paid to the Secretary, who shall deposit such payments in the Treasury in accordance with section 1338 of this title ;

(8) such lease provides for a royalty to the lessor on oil and gas of not less than 12½ per centum and on sulphur of not less than 5 per centum in amount or value of the production saved, removed, or sold from the lease, or, in any case in which the lease provides for a lesser royalty, the holder thereof consents in writing, filed with the Secretary, to the increase of the royalty to the minimum herein specified;

(9) the holder thereof pays to the Secretary within the period or periods specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection an amount equivalent to any severance, gross production, or occupation taxes imposed by the State issuing the lease on the production from the lease, less the State’s royalty interest in such production, between June 5, 1950 , and August 7, 1953 and not heretofore paid to the State, and thereafter pays to the Secretary as an additional royalty on the production from the lease, less the United States’ royalty interest in such production, a sum of money equal to the amount of the severance, gross production, or occupation taxes which would have been payable on such production to the State issuing the lease under its laws as they existed on August 7, 1953 ;

(10) such lease will terminate within a period of not more than five years from August 7, 1953 in the absence of production or operations for drilling, or, in any case in which the lease provides for a longer period, the holder thereof consents in writing, filed with the Secretary, to the reduction of such period so that it will not exceed the maximum period herein specified; and

(11) the holder of such lease furnishes such surety bond, if any, as the Secretary may require and complies with such other reasonable requirements as the Secretary may deem necessary to protect the interests of the United States.
