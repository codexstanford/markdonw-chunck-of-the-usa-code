### CHAPTER 7— HOMESTEADS
#### § 299. Reservation of coal and mineral rights
##### (f) Plan of operations

(1) Before the Secretary may authorize any person to conduct mineral activities on lands subject to this subchapter, the Secretary shall require such person to submit a plan of operations. Such plan shall include procedures for

(A) the minimization of damages to crops and tangible improvements of the surface owner;

(B) the minimization of disruption to grazing or other uses of the land by the surface owner; and

(C) payment of a fee for the use of surface during mineral activities equivalent to the loss of income to the ranch operation as established pursuant to subsection (g).

(2) The Secretary shall provide a copy of the proposed plan of operations to the surface owner at least 45 days prior to the date the Secretary makes a determination as to whether such plan complies with the requirements of this subsection. During such 45-day period the surface owner may submit comments and recommend modifications to the proposed plan of operations to the Secretary.

(3)

(A) The Secretary shall, within 60 days of receipt of the plan, approve the plan of operations if it complies with the requirements of this subchapter, including each of the following:

(i) The proposed plan of operations is complete and accurate.

(ii) The person submitting the proposed plan of operations has demonstrated that all other applicable Federal and State requirements have been met.

(B) The Secretary shall notify the person submitting a plan of operations of any modifications to such plan required to bring it into compliance with the requirements of this subchapter. If the person submitting the plan agrees to modify such plan in a manner acceptable to the Secretary, the Secretary shall approve the plan as modified. In the event no agreement can be reached on the modifications to the plan which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will bring such plan into compliance with the requirements of this subchapter, then the Secretary shall disapprove the plan and notify both the surface owner and the person submitting the plan of the decision.

(C) The 60-day period referred to in subparagraph (A) may be extended by the Secretary where additional time is required to comply with other applicable requirements of law.

(D) The Secretary shall suspend or revoke a plan of operation whenever the Secretary determines, on the Secretary’s own motion or on a motion made by the surface owner, that the person conducting mineral activities is in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of an approved plan of operations and has failed to remedy a violation after notice from the Secretary within the time required by the Secretary.

(4) Final approval of a plan of operations under this subsection shall be conditioned upon compliance with subsections (e) and (g).
