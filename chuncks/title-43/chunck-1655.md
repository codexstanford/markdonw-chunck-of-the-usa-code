### CHAPTER 33— ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
#### § 1627. Merger of Native corporations
##### (c) Alteration or elimination of dividend rights

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1606(j) or (m) of this title, in any merger or consolidation in which the class of stockholders of a Regional Corporation who are not residents of any of the villages in the region are entitled under Alaska law to vote as a class, the terms of the merger or consolidation may provide for the alteration or elimination of the right of said class to receive dividends pursuant to said section 1606(j) or (m) of this title. In the event that such dividend right is not expressly altered or eliminated by the terms of the merger or consolidation, such class of stockholders shall continue to receive such dividends pursuant to section 1606(j) or (m) of this title as would have been applicable if the merger or consolidation had not taken place and all Village Corporations within the affected region continued to exist separately.
