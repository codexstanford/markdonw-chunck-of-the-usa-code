### CHAPTER 33— ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
#### § 1609. Limitation of actions
##### (a) Complaint, time for filing; jurisdiction; commencement by State official; certainty and finality of vested rights, titles, and interests

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action to contest the authority of the United States to legislate on the subject matter or the legality of this chapter shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within one year of December 18, 1971 , and no such action shall be entertained unless it is commenced by a duly authorized official of the State. Exclusive jurisdiction over such action is hereby vested in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. The purpose of this limitation on suits is to insure that, after the expiration of a reasonable period of time, the right, title, and interest of the United States, the Natives, and the State of Alaska will vest with certainty and finality and may be relied upon by all other persons in their relations with the State, the Natives, and the United States.
