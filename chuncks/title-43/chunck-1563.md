#### § 1608. Revenue sharing
##### (g) Alaska Native Fund payments; cessation; reimbursement for advance payments

The payments required by this section shall continue only until a sum of $500,000,000 has been paid into the Alaska Native Fund less the total of advance payments paid into the Alaska Native Fund pursuant to section 407 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act. Thereafter, payments which would otherwise go into the Alaska Native Fund will be made to the United States Treasury as reimbursement for the advance payments authorized by section 407 of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act. The provisions of this section shall no longer apply, and the reservation required in patents under this section shall be of no further force and effect, after a total sum of $500,000,000 has been paid to the Alaska Native Fund and to the United States Treasury pursuant to this subsection.
