### CHAPTER 32B— COLORADO RIVER FLOODWAY
#### § 1600. Findings and purposes
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) there are multiple purposes established by law for the dams and other control structures administered by the Secretary of the Interior on the Colorado River;

(2) the maintenance of the Colorado River Floodway established in this chapter is essential to accomplish these multiple purposes;

(3) developments within the Floodway are and will continue to be vulnerable to damaging flows such as the property damage which occurred in 1983 and may occur in the future;

(4) certain Federal programs which subsidize or permit development within the Floodway threaten human life, health, property, and natural resources; and

(5) there is a need for coordinated Federal, State, and local action to limit Floodway development.
