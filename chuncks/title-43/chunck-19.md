### CHAPTER 2— UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
#### § 31c. Geologic mapping program
##### (d) Program components

(1) Federal component

(A) In general

The geologic mapping program shall include a Federal geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to determine the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, environmental, or scientific welfare of the United States.

(B) Mapping priorities

For the Federal component, mapping priorities

(i) shall be described in the 5-year plan under section 31e of this title ; and

(ii) shall be based on

(I) national requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need;

(II) national requirements for geologic map information in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth science problems; and

(III) the needs of land management agencies of the Department of the Interior.

(C) Interdisciplinary studies

(i) In general

The Federal component shall include interdisciplinary studies that add value to geologic mapping.

(ii) Representative categories

Interdisciplinary studies under clause (i) may include

(I) establishment of a national geologic map database under section 31f of this title ;

(II) studies that lead to the implementation of cost-effective digital methods for the acquisition, compilation, analysis, cartographic production, and dissemination of geologic map information;

(III) paleontologic, geochrono-logic, and isotopic investigations that provide information critical to understanding the age and history of geologic map units;

(IV) geophysical investigations that assist in delineating and mapping the physical characteristics and 3-dimensional distribution of geologic materials and geologic structures; and

(V) geochemical investigations and analytical operations that characterize the composition of geologic map units.

(iii) Use of results

The results of investigations under clause (ii) shall be contributed to national databases.

(2) State component

(A) In general

The geologic mapping program shall include a State geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to establish the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, environmental, or scientific welfare of individual States.

(B) Mapping priorities

For the State component, mapping priorities

(i) shall be determined by State panels representing a broad range of users of geologic maps; and

(ii) shall be based on

(I) State requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need; and

(II) State requirements for geologic map information in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth science problems.

(C) Integration of Federal and State priorities

A national panel including representatives of the Survey shall integrate the State mapping priorities under this paragraph with the Federal mapping priorities under paragraph (1).

(D) Use of funds

The Survey and recipients of grants under the State component shall not use more than 15.25 percent of the Federal funds made available under the State component for any fiscal year to pay indirect, servicing, or program management charges.

(E) Federal share

The Federal share of the cost of activities under the State component for any fiscal year shall not exceed 50 percent.

(3) Education component

(A) In general

The geologic mapping program shall include a geologic mapping education component for the training of geologic mappers, the objectives of which shall be

(i) to provide for broad education in geologic mapping and field analysis through support of field studies; and

(ii) to develop academic programs that teach students of earth science the fundamental principles of geologic mapping and field analysis.

(B) Investigations

The education component may include the conduct of investigations, which

(i) shall be integrated with the Federal component and the State component; and

(ii) shall respond to mapping priorities identified for the Federal component and the State component.

(C) Use of funds

The Survey and recipients of grants under the education component shall not use more than 15.25 percent of the Federal funds made available under the education component for any fiscal year to pay indirect, servicing, or program management charges.

(D) Federal share

The Federal share of the cost of activities under the education component for any fiscal year shall not exceed 50 percent.

(4) Abandoned mine land and mine waste component

(A) In general

The geologic mapping program shall include an abandoned mine land and mine waste geologic mapping component, the objective of which shall be to establish the geologic framework of abandoned mine land and other land containing mine waste.

(B) Mapping priorities

For the component described in subparagraph (A), the priority shall be mapping abandoned mine land and other land containing mine waste where multiple critical mineral (as defined in section 1606(a) of title 30 ) and metal commodities are anticipated to be present, rather than single mineral resources.
