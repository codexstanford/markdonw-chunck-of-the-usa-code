### CHAPTER 33— ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT
#### § 1629c. Duration of alienability restrictions
##### (d) Opt-in procedure
######## (C) An amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B) and any amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (D) may provide for an extension of alienability restrictions for

(i) an indefinite period of time, or

(ii) a specified period of time of not less than one year and not more than fifty years.

(D) If an amendment approved by the shareholders of a Native Corporation pursuant to subparagraph (B) or this subparagraph extends alienability restrictions for a specified period of time, termination of the restrictions at the close of such period may be postponed if a further amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation is approved to extend the restrictions. There shall be no limit on the number of such amendments that can be approved. Such amendments shall not be effective to extend the restrictions unless approved prior to the expiration of the period of extension then in force.

(3)

(A) If an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation extending alienability restrictions for a specified period of time is approved pursuant to paragraph (2), the restrictions shall automatically terminate at the end of such period unless the restrictions are extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2)(D).

(B) If the board of directors of a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection does not submit for a shareholder vote an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation in accordance with paragraph (2)(B), or if the amendment submitted does not comply with paragraph (2)(C), alienability restrictions shall not terminate and shall instead remain in effect until such time as a court of competent jurisdiction, upon petition of one or more shareholders of the corporation, orders that a shareholder vote be taken on an amendment which complies with paragraph (2)(C) and such vote is conducted. Following the vote, the status of alienability restrictions shall be determined in accordance with the other provisions of this subsection and the amendment, if approved.

(4)

(A) A Native Corporation that approves an amendment to its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (2) to extend alienability restrictions for an indefinite period of time may later amend its articles of incorporation to terminate the restrictions. Such amendment shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which the restrictions shall terminate.

(B) The rejection of an amendment described in subparagraph (A) by the shareholders shall not preclude consideration of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.
