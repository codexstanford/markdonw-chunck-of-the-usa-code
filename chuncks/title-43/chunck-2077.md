### CHAPTER 36— OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
#### § 1843. Duties and powers of Secretary
##### (c) Disbursement of payments to compensate commercial fishermen; restrictions

(1) Payments shall be disbursed by the Secretary from the Fund to compensate commercial fishermen for actual and consequential damages, including resulting economic loss, due to damages to, or loss of, fishing gear by materials, equipment, tools, containers, or other items associated with Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas exploration, development, or production activities. The compensation payable under this section for resulting economic loss shall be an amount equal to 50 per centum of such loss. For purposes of this subsection, the term “resulting economic loss” means the gross income, as estimated by the Secretary, that a commercial fisherman who is eligible for compensation under this section will lose by reason of not being able to engage in fishing, or having to reduce his fishing effort, during the period before the damaged or lost fishing gear concerned is repaired or replaced and available for use.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, no payment may be made by the Secretary from the Fund

(A) to the extent that damages were caused by the negligence or fault of the commercial fisherman making the claim;

(B) if the damage set forth in the claim was sustained prior to September 18, 1978 ;

(C) in the case of a claim for damage to, or loss of, fishing gear, in an amount in excess of the replacement value of the fishing gear with respect to which the claim is filed; and

(D) for any portion of the damages claimed with respect to which the claimant has received, or will receive, compensation from insurance.
