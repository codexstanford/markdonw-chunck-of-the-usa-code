(2) Aquifer recharge on eligible land

(A) In general

Subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), the Secretary may contract with a holder of a water service or repayment contract for a Reclamation project to allow the contractor, in accordance with applicable State laws and policies

The use of a Reclamation facility for aquifer recharge under subparagraph (A) shall be considered an authorized use for the Reclamation project if requested by a holder of a water service or repayment contract for the Reclamation facility.

(C) Modifications to contracts

The Secretary may contract with a holder of a water service or repayment contract for a Reclamation project under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that a new contract or contract amendment described in that subparagraph is

This section shall not apply to the State of California.
