### CHAPTER 32A— COLORADO RIVER BASIN SALINITY CONTROL
#### § 1592. Authorization to construct, operate, and maintain salinity control units and salinity control programs
##### (b) Implementation of authorized units

In implementing the units authorized to be constructed pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall carry out the following directions:

(1) As reports are completed describing final implementation plans for the unit, or any portion thereof, authorized by paragraph (5) of subsection (a), and prior to expenditure of funds for related construction activities, the Secretary shall submit such reports to the appropriate committees of the Congress and to the governors of the Colorado River Basin States.

(2) Non-Federal entities shall be required by the Secretary to contract for the long-term operation and maintenance of canal and lateral systems constructed pursuant to activities provided for in subsection (a): Provided , That the Secretary shall reimburse such non-Federal entities for the costs of such operation and maintenance to the extent the costs exceed the expenses that would have been incurred by them in the thorough and timely operation and maintenance of their canal and lateral systems absent the construction of a unit, said expenses to be determined by the Secretary after consultation with the involved non-Federal entities. The operation and maintenance for which non-Federal entities shall be responsible shall include such repairing and replacing of a unit’s facilities as are associated with normal annual maintenance activities in order to keep such facilities in a condition which will assure maximum reduction of salinity inflow to the Colorado River. These non-Federal entities shall not be responsible, nor incur any costs, for the replacement of a unit’s facilities, including measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone. The term replacement shall be defined for the purposes of this subchapter as a major modification or reconstruction of a completed unit, or portion thereof, which is necessitated, through no fault of the non-Federal entity or entities operating and maintaining a unit, by design or construction inadequacies or by normal limits on the useful life of a facility. The Secretary is authorized to provide continuing technical assistance to non-Federal entities to assure the effective and efficient operation and maintenance of a unit’s facilities.

(3) The Secretary may, under authority of this subchapter, and limited to the purposes of this chapter, fund through a grant or contract, for any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts, a non-Federal entity to organize private canal and lateral owners into formal organizations with which the Secretary may enter into a grant or contract to construct, operate, and maintain a unit’s facilities.

(4) In implementing the units authorized to be constructed or the programs pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) of subsection (a), the Secretary shall comply with procedural and substantive State water laws.

(5) The Secretary may, under authority of this subchapter and limited to the purposes of this chapter, fund through a grant or contract, for any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts, a non-Federal entity to operate and maintain measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone.

(6) In implementing the units authorized to be constructed pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall implement measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone concurrently with the implementation of a unit’s, or a portion of a unit’s, related features.
