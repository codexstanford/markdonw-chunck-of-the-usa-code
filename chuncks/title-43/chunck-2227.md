#### § 2405. Feasibility studies
##### (c) Feasibility factors

Feasibility studies authorized or reviewed under this subchapter shall include an assessment of

(1) near- and long-term water demand in the area to be served by the rural water supply project;

(2) advancement of public health and safety of any existing rural water supply project and other benefits of the proposed rural water supply project;

(3) alternative new water supplies in the study area, including any opportunities to treat and use low-quality water, nonpotable water, water reuse-based supplies, and brackish and saline waters through innovative and economically viable treatment technologies;

(4) environmental quality and source water protection issues related to the rural water supply project;

(5) innovative opportunities for water conservation in the study area to reduce water use and water system costs, including

(A) nonstructural approaches to reduce the need for the project; and

(B) demonstration technologies;

(6) the extent to which the project and alternatives take advantage of economic incentives and the use of market-based mechanisms;

(7)

(A) the construction costs and projected operations, maintenance, and replacement costs of all alternatives; and

(B) the economic feasibility and lowest cost method of obtaining the desired results of each alternative, taking into account the Federal cost-share;

(8) the availability of guaranteed loans for a proposed rural water supply project;

(9) the financial capability of the non-Federal project entity to pay the non-Federal project entity’s proportionate share of the design and construction costs and 100 percent of operations, maintenance, and replacement costs, including the allocation of costs to each non-Federal project entity in the case of multiple entities;

(10) whether the non-Federal project entity has developed an operations, management, and replacement plan to assist the non-Federal project entity in establishing rates and fees for beneficiaries of the rural water supply project that includes a schedule identifying the annual operations, maintenance, and replacement costs that should be allocated to each non-Federal entity participating in the project;

(11)

(A) the non-Federal project entity administrative organization that would implement construction, operations, maintenance, and replacement activities; and

(B) the fiscal, administrative, and operational controls to be implemented to manage the project;

(12) the extent to which assistance for rural water supply is available under other Federal authorities;

(13) the engineering, environmental, and economic activities to be undertaken to carry out the proposed rural water supply project;

(14) the extent to which the project involves partnerships with other State, local, or tribal governments or Federal entities; and

(15) in the case of a project intended for Indian tribes and tribal organizations, the extent to which the project addresses the goal of economic self-sufficiency.
