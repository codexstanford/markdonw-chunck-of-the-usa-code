(i) Costs of construction and replacement of each unit or separable feature thereof authorized by paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 1592  4 of this title, costs of construction of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone, when such measures are a part of the on-farm measures authorized by section 1592(c) of this title or of the units authorized by paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 1592  4 of this title, and costs of implementation of the on-farm measures authorized by section 1592(c) of this title allocated to the upper basin and to the lower basin under subsection (a)(2) shall be repaid as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), respectively, of this paragraph.

(iii) Costs allocated to the lower basin shall be repaid without interest as such costs are incurred to the extent that money is available from the Lower Colorado River Basin development fund to repay costs allocated to the lower basin. If in any fiscal year the money available from the Lower Colorado River Basin development fund for such repayment is insufficient to repay the costs allocated to the lower basin, as provided in the preceding sentence, the deficiency shall be repaid with interest as soon as money becomes available in the fund for repayment of those costs.

(iv) The interest rates used pursuant to this chapter shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period during the month preceding October 30, 1984 , for costs outstanding at that date, or, in the case of costs incurred subsequent to October 30, 1984 , during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred.

(5) Costs of operation and maintenance of each unit or separable feature thereof authorized by section 1592(a) of this title and of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone allocated to the upper basin and to the lower basin under subsection (a)(2) shall be repaid without interest in the fiscal year next succeeding the fiscal year in which such costs are incurred. In the event that revenues are not available to repay the portion of operation and maintenance costs allocated to the Upper Colorado River Basin fund and to the Lower Colorado River Basin development fund in the year next succeeding the fiscal year in which such costs are incurred, the deficiency shall be repayed  5 with interest calculated in the same manner as provided in subsection (a)(4)(iv). Any reimbursement due non-Federal entities pursuant to section 1592(b)(2) of this title shall be repaid without interest in the fiscal year next succeeding the fiscal year in which such operation and maintenance costs are incurred.
