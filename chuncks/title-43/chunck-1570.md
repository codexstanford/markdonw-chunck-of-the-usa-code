(1) During a period of three years from December 18, 1971 , the Village Corporation for each Native village identified pursuant to section 1610 of this title shall select, in accordance with rules established by the Secretary, all of the township or townships in which any part of the village is located, plus an area that will make the total selection equal to the acreage to which the village is entitled under section 1613 of this title . The selection shall be made from lands withdrawn by section 1610(a) of this title : Provided , That no Village Corporation may select more than 69,120 acres from lands withdrawn by section 1610(a)(2) of this title , and not more than 69,120 acres from the National Wildlife Refuge System, and not more than 69,120 acres in a National Forest: Provided further , That when a Village Corporation selects the surface estate to lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System or Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4, the Regional Corporation, for that region may select the subsurface estate in an equal acreage from other lands withdrawn in section 1610(a) of this title within the region, if possible.

(2) Selections made under this subsection (a) shall be contiguous and in reasonably compact tracts, except as separated by bodies of water or by lands which are unavailable for selection, and shall be in whole sections and, wherever feasible, in units of not less than 1,280 acres: Provided , That the Secretary in his discretion and upon the request of the concerned Village Corporation, may waive the whole section requirement where

(A)

(i) a portion of available public lands of a section is separated from other available public lands in the same section by lands unavailable for selection or by a meanderable body of water;

(ii) such waiver will not result in small isolated parcels of available public land remaining after conveyance of selected lands to Native Corporations; and

(iii) such waiver would result in a better land ownership pattern or improved land or resource management opportunity; or

(B) the remaining available public lands in the section have been selected and will be conveyed to another Native Corporation under this chapter.
