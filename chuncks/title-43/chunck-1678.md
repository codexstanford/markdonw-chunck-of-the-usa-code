(ii) the surface estate of land that is both

(I) exempt from real estate taxation pursuant to section 1636(d)(1)(A) of this title ; and

(II) used by the shareholders of the corporation for subsistence uses (as defined in section 3113 of title 16 ); or

(iii) land or interest in land which the board of directors believes to be only of speculative value; in connection with any communication made to the shareholders pursuant to this subsection.

(C) If the board of directors determines, for quorum purposes or otherwise, that a previously-noticed meeting must be postponed or adjourned, it may, by giving notice to the shareholders, set a new date for such meeting not more than forty-five days later than the original date without sending the shareholders a new written notice (or a new summary of changes to be effected).
