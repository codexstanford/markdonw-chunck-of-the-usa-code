#### § 1600c. Colorado River Floodway
##### (b) Study of tributary floodflows; determination of Floodway boundary

Within eighteen months after October 8, 1986 , the Secretary, in consultation with the seven Colorado River Basin States, represented by persons designated by the Governors of those States, the Colorado River Floodway Task Force, and any other interested parties shall:

(1) complete a study of the tributary floodflows downstream of Davis Dam;

(2) define the specific boundaries of the Colorado River Floodway so that the Floodway can accommodate either a one-in-one hundred year river flow consisting of controlled releases and tributary inflow, or a flow of forty thousand cubic feet per second (cfs), whichever is greater, from below Davis Dam to the Southerly International Boundary between the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico.
