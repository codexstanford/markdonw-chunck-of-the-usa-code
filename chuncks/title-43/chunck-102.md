#### § 125. Annexation of discontinued district to adjacent district

Whenever the cost of collecting the revenue from the sales of the public lands in any land district is as much as one-third of the whole amount of revenue collected in such district, it may be lawful for the President, if, in his opinion, not incompatible with the public interest, to discontinue the land office in such district, and to annex the same to some other adjoining land district.
