##### (d) Funding

(1) Credits to funds

A FLAME Fund shall consist of the following:

(A) Such amounts as are appropriated to that FLAME Fund.

(B) Such amounts as are transferred to that FLAME Fund under paragraph (5).

(2) Authorization of appropriations

(A) Authorization of appropriations

There are authorized to be appropriated to the FLAME Funds such amounts as are necessary to carry out this section.

(B) Congressional intent

It is the intent of Congress that, for fiscal year 2011 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amounts requested by the President for a FLAME Fund should be not less than the amount estimated by the Secretary concerned as the amount necessary for that fiscal year for wildfire suppression activities of the Secretary that meet the criteria specified in subsection (e)(2)(B)(i).

(C) Sense of Congress on designation of flame fund appropriations, supplemental funding request, and supplement to other suppression funding

It is the sense of Congress that for fiscal year 2011 and each fiscal year thereafter

(i) amounts appropriated to a FLAME Fund in excess of the amount estimated by the Secretary concerned as the amount necessary for that fiscal year for wildfire suppression activities of the Secretary that meet the criteria specified in subsection (e)(2)(B)(i) should be designated as amounts necessary to meet emergency needs;

(ii) the Secretary concerned should promptly make a supplemental request for additional funds to replenish the FLAME Fund if the Secretary determines that the FLAME Fund will be exhausted within 30 days; and

(iii) funding made available through the FLAME Fund should be used to supplement the funding otherwise appropriated to the Secretary concerned for wildfire suppression and Federal emergency response in the Wildland Fire Management appropriation accounts.

(3) Availability

Amounts in a FLAME Fund shall remain available to the Secretary concerned until expended.

(4) Notice of insufficient funds

The Secretary concerned shall notify the relevant congressional committees if the Secretary estimates that only 60 days worth of funds remain in the FLAME Fund administered by that Secretary.

(5) Transfer authority

If a FLAME Fund has insufficient funds, the Secretary concerned administering the other FLAME Fund may transfer amounts to the FLAME Fund with insufficient funds. Not more than $100,000,000 may be transferred from a FLAME Fund during any fiscal year under this authority.
