###### (b) Action by Chief Judge Following Review .

After expeditiously reviewing a complaint under subsection (a), the chief judge, by written order stating his or her reasons, may

(1) dismiss the complaint

(A) if the chief judge finds the complaint to be

(i) not in conformity with section 351(a);

(ii) directly related to the merits of a decision or procedural ruling; or

(iii) frivolous, lacking sufficient evidence to raise an inference that misconduct has occurred, or containing allegations which are incapable of being established through investigation; or

(B) when a limited inquiry conducted under subsection (a) demonstrates that the allegations in the complaint lack any factual foundation or are conclusively refuted by objective evidence; or

(2) conclude the proceeding if the chief judge finds that appropriate corrective action has been taken or that action on the complaint is no longer necessary because of intervening events. The chief judge shall transmit copies of the written order to the complainant and to the judge whose conduct is the subject of the complaint.
