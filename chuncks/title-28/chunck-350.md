### CHAPTER 40— INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
#### § 591. Applicability of provisions of this chapter
###### (d) Examination of Information to Determine Need for Preliminary Investigation.

(1) Factors to be considered .

In determining under subsection (a) or (c) (or section 592(c)(2)) whether grounds to investigate exist, the Attorney General shall consider only

(A) the specificity of the information received; and

(B) the credibility of the source of the information.

(2) Time period for making determination .

The Attorney General shall determine whether grounds to investigate exist not later than 30 days after the information is first received. If within that 30-day period the Attorney General determines that the information is not specific or is not from a credible source, then the Attorney General shall close the matter. If within that 30-day period the Attorney General determines that the information is specific and from a credible source, the Attorney General shall, upon making that determination, commence a preliminary investigation with respect to that information. If the Attorney General is unable to determine, within that 30-day period, whether the information is specific and from a credible source, the Attorney General shall, at the end of that 30-day period, commence a preliminary investigation with respect to that information.
