##### (d) Requirements for injunctions and orders

(1) In general

In any action brought under this section, upon a proper showing by the attorney general of the State, the court may issue a preliminary or permanent injunction to restrain a violation of this section. A proper showing under this paragraph shall require that a State prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of State law as described in subsection (b) has taken place or is taking place.

(2) Additional showing for preliminary injunction

No preliminary injunction may be granted except upon

(A) evidence demonstrating the probability of irreparable injury if injunctive relief is not granted; and

(B) evidence supporting the probability of success on the merits.

(3) Notice

No preliminary or permanent injunction may be issued under paragraph (1) without notice to the adverse party and an opportunity for a hearing.

(4) Form and scope of order

Any preliminary or permanent injunction entered in an action brought under this section shall

(A) set forth the reasons for the issuance of the order;

(B) be specific in terms;

(C) describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and

(D) be binding upon

(i) the parties to the action and the officers, agents, employees, and attorneys of those parties; and

(ii) persons in active concert or participation with the parties to the action who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.

(5) Admissibility of evidence

In a hearing on an application for a permanent injunction, any evidence previously received on an application for a preliminary injunction in connection with the same civil action and that would otherwise be admissible, may be made a part of the record of the hearing on the permanent injunction.
