### CHAPTER 7— ALLOWANCES OTHER THAN TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES
#### § 427. Family separation allowance
###### (c) Effect of Election to Serve Unaccompanied Tour of Duty .

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), a member who elects to serve a tour of duty unaccompanied by his dependents at a permanent station to which the movement of his dependents is authorized at the expense of the United States under section 452 of this title is not entitled to an allowance under subsection (a)(1)(A).

(2) The prohibition in the first sentence of paragraph (1) does not apply to a member who elects to serve an unaccompanied tour of duty because a dependent cannot accompany the member to or at that permanent station for certified medical reasons.

(3) The Secretary concerned may waive paragraph (1) in situations in which it would be inequitable to deny the allowance to the member because of unusual family or operational circumstances.
