### CHAPTER 7— ALLOWANCES OTHER THAN TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES
#### § 403. Basic allowance for housing
###### (n) Members Paying Child Support .

(1) A member of a uniformed service with dependents may not be paid a basic allowance for housing at the with dependents rate solely by reason of the payment of child support by the member if

(A) the member is assigned to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service; or

(B) the member is assigned to sea duty, and elects not to occupy assigned quarters for unaccompanied personnel, unless the member is in a pay grade above E–3.

(2) A member of a uniformed service assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service who is not otherwise authorized a basic allowance for housing and who pays child support is entitled to the basic allowance for housing differential, except for months for which the amount payable for the child support is less than the rate of the differential. Payment of a basic allowance for housing differential does not affect any entitlement of the member to a partial allowance for quarters under subsection (n).

(3) The basic allowance for housing differential to which a member is entitled under paragraph (2) is the amount equal to the difference between

(A) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (with dependents) for the member’s pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997 , under this section (as in effect on that date); and

(B) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (without dependents) for the member’s pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997 , under this section (as in effect on that date).

(4) Whenever the rates of basic pay for members of the uniformed services are increased, the monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing differential computed under paragraph (3) shall be increased by the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay. The effective date of the increase shall be the same date as the effective date of the increase in the rates of basic pay.

(5) In the case of two members, who have one or more common dependents (and no others), who are not married to each other, and one of whom pays child support to the other, the amount of the basic allowance for housing paid to each member under this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. The total amount of the basic allowances for housing paid to the two members may not exceed the sum of the amounts of the allowance to which each member would be otherwise entitled under this section.
