#### § 1007. Deductions from pay
######## (A) If a member of the uniformed services, through no fault of the member, incurs a wound, injury, or illness while in the line of duty in a combat operation or combat zone designated by the President or the Secretary of Defense, any overpayment of pay or allowances made to the member while the member recovers from the wound, injury, or illness may not be deducted from the member’s pay until

(i) the member is notified of the overpayment; and

(I) The end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the completion of the tour of duty of the member in the combat operation or combat zone.

(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the member, after receiving notification of the overpayment, requests or consents to initiation at an earlier date of the collection of the overpayment of the pay or allowances.

(d) Subject to subsection (c), an amount due the United States from an enlisted member of the Army, the Air Force, or the Space Force may be deducted from the member’s pay on final statement, or from the member’s savings on his clothing allowance.

(g) An amount due the United States from an officer of the Army, the Air Force, or the Space Force for rations bought on credit, and for articles bought on credit under section 4621(a)(1) or 9621(a)(1) of title 10, shall be deducted from the next pay due that officer after the sale is reported.

The amount to be deducted may be fixed at different amounts on the basis of grade or length of service, or both.

(4) This subsection does not apply to an enlisted member, warrant officer, or limited duty officer of a reserve component.
