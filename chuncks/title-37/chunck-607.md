# Title 37— PAY AND ALLOWANCES OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES
### CHAPTER 10— PAYMENTS TO MISSING PERSONS
#### § 552. Pay and allowances; continuance while in a missing status; limitations
###### (a) A member of a uniformed service who is on active duty or performing inactive-duty training, and who is in a missing status, is

(1) for the period he is in that status, entitled to receive or have credited to his account the same pay and allowances, as defined in this chapter, to which he was entitled at the beginning of that period or may thereafter become entitled; and

(2) for the period, not to exceed one year, required for his hospitalization and rehabilitation after termination of that status, under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, with respect to incentive pay, considered to have satisfied the requirements of section 301 or section 351(a)(2) of this title so as to entitle him to a continuance of that pay. However, a member who is performing full-time training duty or other full-time duty without pay, or inactive-duty training with or without pay, is entitled to the pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled if he had been on active duty with pay. Notwithstanding section 1523 of title 10 or any other provision of law, the promotion of a member while he is in a missing status is fully effective for all purposes.
