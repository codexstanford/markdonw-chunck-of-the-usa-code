### CHAPTER 9— LEAVE
#### § 501. Payments for unused accrued leave
###### (g) An officer of the Regular Corps of the Public Health Service, or an officer of the Reserve Corps  1 of the Public Health Service on active duty, who is credited with accumulated and accrued annual leave on the date of his separation, retirement, or release from active duty, shall, if his application for that leave is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, be paid for that leave in a lump-sum on the basis of his basic pay, subsistence allowance, and allowance for quarters whether or not he is receiving that allowance on that date. However, the number of days upon which the lump-sum payment is based is subject to subsection (f). A lump-sum payment may not be made under this subsection to an officer

(1) whose appointment expires or is terminated and who, without a break in active service, accepts a new appointment;

(2) who is retired for age in time of war and is continued on, or recalled to, active duty without a break in active service; or

(3) who is transferred to another department or agency of the United States under circumstances in which, by any other law, his leave may be transferred. In this subsection, the term “accumulated annual leave” means unused accrued annual leave carried forward from one leave year into the next leave year, and the term “accrued annual leave” means the annual leave accruing to an officer during one leave year.

(h) Payment shall be made for all leave accumulated under section 701(f) of title 10 as soon as possible after the name of the person concerned is removed from a missing status, as defined in section 551(2) of this title .
