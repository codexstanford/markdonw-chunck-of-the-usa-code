### CHAPTER 7— ALLOWANCES OTHER THAN TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES
#### § 403b. Cost-of-living allowance in the continental United States
###### (c) High Cost Area Defined .

An area is a high cost area for a fiscal year for purposes of this section if the uniformed services cost of living for that area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period by at least the threshold percentage. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent. The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.
