### CHAPTER 7— ALLOWANCES OTHER THAN TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES
#### § 403. Basic allowance for housing
###### (p) Treatment of Certain Moves as Not Being Reassignments .
######## (A) In the case of a member without dependents who is assigned to a unit that undergoes a change of home port or a change of permanent duty station, if the Secretary concerned determines that it would be inequitable to base the member’s entitlement to, and amount of, a basic allowance for housing on the new home port or permanent duty station, the Secretary concerned may

(i) waive the requirement to base the member’s entitlement to, and amount of, a basic allowance for housing on the new home port or permanent duty station member; and

(ii) treat that member for the purposes of this section as if the unit to which the member is assigned did not undergo such a change.
