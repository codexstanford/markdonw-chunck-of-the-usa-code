### CHAPTER 10— PAYMENTS TO MISSING PERSONS
#### § 555. Secretarial review
###### (b) When a finding of death is made under subsection (a), it shall include the date death is presumed to have occurred for the purpose of

(1) ending the crediting of pay and allowances;

(2) settlement of accounts; and

(3) payment of death gratuities. That date is

(A) the day after the day on which the 12-month period in a missing status ends; or

(B) if the missing status has been continued under subsection (a), the day determined by the Secretary concerned, or his designee.

(c) For the sole purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of a member on active duty is treated as if he were a member. Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States. This subsection does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.

(d) This section does not apply in a case to which section 1502 of title 10 applies.
