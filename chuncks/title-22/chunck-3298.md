(1) Items covered

Articles of furniture, fixtures, and decorative objects of the reception areas (and similar articles, fixtures, and objects acquired by the Secretary of State), when declared by the Secretary of State to be of historic or artistic interest, shall thereafter be considered to be the property of the Secretary in his or her official capacity and shall be subject to disposition solely in accordance with this subsection.

(2) Sale or trade

Whenever the Secretary of State determines that

(A) any item covered by paragraph (1) is no longer needed for use or display in the reception areas, or

(B) in order to upgrade the reception areas, a better use of that article would be its sale or exchange, the Secretary may, with the advice and concurrence of the Director of the National Gallery of Art, sell the item at fair market value or trade it, without regard to the requirements of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41.

(3) Smithsonian Institution

The Secretary of State may also lend items covered by paragraph (1), when not needed for use or display in the reception areas, to the Smithsonian Institution or a similar institution for care, repair, study, storage, or exhibition.
