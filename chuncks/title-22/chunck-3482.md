#### § 2764. Guaranties
##### (c) Guaranty Reserve Fund; payment of guaranties; guaranty reserve below prescribed amount

Funds obligated under this section before December 16, 1980 , which constitute a single reserve for the payment of claims under guaranties issued under this section shall remain available for expenditure for the purposes of this section on and after that date. That single reserve may, on and after August 8, 1985 , be referred to as the “Guaranty Reserve Fund”. Funds provided for necessary expenses to carry out the provisions of section 2763 of this title and of section 2311 of this title may be used to pay claims on the Guaranty Reserve Fund to the extent that funds in the Guaranty Reserve Fund are inadequate for that purpose. For purposes of any provision in this chapter or any other Act relating to a prohibition or limitation on the availability of funds under this chapter, whenever a guaranty is issued under this section, the principal amount of the loan so guaranteed shall be deemed to be funds made available for use under this chapter. Any guaranties issued hereunder shall be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
