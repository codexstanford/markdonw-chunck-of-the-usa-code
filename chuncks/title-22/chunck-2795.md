The United States has an interest in increasing the level of financial support provided to United States-sponsored elementary and secondary schools in countries with predominantly Muslim populations in order to

(1) increase the number of students in such countries who attend such schools;

(3) increase the number of young people who may thereby improve their proficiency in the English language.
