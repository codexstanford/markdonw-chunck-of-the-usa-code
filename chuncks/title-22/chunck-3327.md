##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) Congress has recognized, including in division E of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 ( Public Law 117–81 ), that the Department is a crucial national security agency, whose employees, both Foreign Service and Civil Service, require the best possible training and professional development at every stage of their careers to prepare them to promote and defend United States national interests and the health and safety of United States citizens abroad; and

(2) the new and evolving challenges of national security in the 21st century necessitate the expansion of standardized training and professional development opportunities linked to equal, accountable, and transparent promotion and leadership practices for Department and other national security agency personnel.
