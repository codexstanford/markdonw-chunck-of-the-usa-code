If not classified under the national security system of classification, such information shall be made available to the public;

The list shall be developed in consultation with interested members of the public and made available to the Committee on Appropriations by December 31, 1986 and semiannually thereafter; and

(3) study the feasibility of creating a cooperative “early warning system” for projects of concern with other interested donors.
