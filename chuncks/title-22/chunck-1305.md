##### (d) Reports

(1) Comprehensive annual report

(A) In general

Not less frequently than annually, the Commission shall submit a comprehensive report on public diplomacy and international broadcasting activities to Congress, the President, and the Secretary of State. This report shall include

(i) a detailed list of all public diplomacy activities funded by the United States Government;

(ii) a description of

(I) the purpose, means, and geographic scope of each activity;

(II) when each activity was started;

(III) the amount of Federal funding expended on each activity;

(IV) any significant outside sources of funding; and

(V) the Federal department or agency to which the activity belongs;

(iii) the international broadcasting activities under the direction of the Broadcasting Board of Governors;

(iv) an assessment of potentially duplicative public diplomacy and international broadcasting activities; and

(v) for any activities determined to be ineffective or results not demonstrated under subparagraph (B), recommendations on existing effective or moderately effective public diplomacy activities that could be augmented to carry out the objectives of the ineffective activities.

(B) Effectiveness assessment

In evaluating the public diplomacy and international broadcasting activities described in subparagraph (A), the Commission shall conduct an assessment that considers the public diplomacy target impact, the achieved impact, and the cost of public diplomacy activities and international broadcasting. The assessment shall include, if practicable, an appropriate metric such as “cost-per-audience” or “cost-per-student” for each activity. Upon the completion of the assessment, the Commission shall assign a rating of

(i) “effective” for activities that

(I) set appropriate goals and achieve all or most of the desired results;

(II) are well-managed; and

(III) are cost efficient;

(ii) “moderately effective” for activities that

(I) set appropriate goals and achieve some desired results;

(II) are generally well-managed; and

(III) need to improve their cost efficiency, including reducing overhead;

(iii) “ineffective” for activities that

(I) lack appropriate goals or fail to achieve stated goals or desired results;

(II) are not well-managed; or

(III) are not cost efficient, such as through insufficient use of available resources to achieve stated goals or desired results, or have excessive overhead; and

(iv) “results not demonstrated” for activities that

(I) do not have acceptable performance public diplomacy metrics for measuring results; or

(II) are unable or failed to collect data to determine if they are effective.

(2) Other reports

(A) In general

The Commission shall submit other reports, including working papers, to Congress, the President, and the Secretary of State at least semi-annually on other activities and policies related to United States public diplomacy.

(B) Availability

The Commission shall make the reports submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) publicly available on the website of the Commission to develop a better understanding of, and support for, public diplomacy activities.

(3) Access to information

The Secretary of State shall ensure that the Commission has access to all appropriate information to carry out its duties and responsibilities under this subsection.
