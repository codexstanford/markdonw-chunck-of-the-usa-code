#### § 4045. Contributions to Fund
##### (c) Transfer of contributions from other Government retirement fund

(1) If a member of the Service who is under another retirement system for Government employees becomes a participant in the System by direct transfer, the total contributions and deposits of that member that would otherwise be refundable on separation (except voluntary contributions), including interest thereon, shall be transferred to the Fund effective as of the date such member becomes a participant in the System. Each such member shall be deemed to consent to the transfer of such funds, and such transfer shall be a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands against the other Government retirement fund on account of service rendered by such member prior to becoming a participant in the System.

(2) A member of the Service whose contributions are transferred to the Fund pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be required to make additional contributions for periods of service for which required contributions were made to the other Government retirement fund; nor shall any refund be made to any such member on account of contributions made during any period to the other Government retirement fund at a higher rate than that fixed by subsection (d).
