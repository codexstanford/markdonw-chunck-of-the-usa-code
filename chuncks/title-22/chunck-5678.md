#### § 6442a. Non-state actor designations
##### (e) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the Secretary of State should work with Congress and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom

(A) to create new political, financial, and diplomatic tools to address severe violations of religious freedom by non-state actors; and

(B) to update the actions the President can take under section 405 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 ( 22 U.S.C. 6445 );

(2) governments must ultimately be held accountable for the abuses that occur in their territories; and

(3) any actions the President takes after designating a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern should also involve high-level diplomacy with the government of the country in which the non-state actor is operating.
