### CHAPTER 48A— TAIWAN ENHANCED RESILIENCE
#### § 3372. Strategy to support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international organizations
##### (b) Matters to be included

The strategy required under subsection (a) should include the following elements:

(1) An assessment of the methods the PRC uses to coerce actors to into adhering to its “One-China Principle.” The methods should include those employed against governments, IOs, and civil society organizations. The assessment should also include pressure on commercial actors, to the extent it is relevant in the context of Taiwan’s meaningful participation in IOs.

(2) An assessment of the policies of foreign governments toward the PRC and Taiwan, to identify likeminded allies and partners who might become public or private partners in the strategy.

(3) A systematic analysis of all IOs, as practicable, to identify IOs that best lend themselves to advancing Taiwan’s participation.

(4) A plan to expand economic, security, and diplomatic engagement with nations that have demonstrably strengthened, enhanced, or upgraded relations with Taiwan, in accordance with United States interests.

(5) A survey of IOs that have allowed Taiwan’s meaningful participation, including an assessment of whether any erosion in Taiwan’s engagement has occurred within those organizations and how Taiwan’s participation has positively strengthened the capacity and activity of these organizations, thereby providing positive models for Taiwan’s inclusion in other similar forums.

(6) A list of no more than 20 IOs at which the United States Government will prioritize for using its voice, vote, and influence to advance Taiwan’s meaningful participation over the three-year period following December 23, 2022 . The list should be derived from the IOs identified in paragraph (3).

(7) A description of the diplomatic strategies and the coalitions the United States Government plans to develop to implement paragraph (6).
