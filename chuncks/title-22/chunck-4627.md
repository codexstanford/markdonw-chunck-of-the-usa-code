#### § 4117. Standards of conduct for labor organizations
##### (b) Furnishing of information

A labor organization may be required to furnish evidence of its freedom from corrupt influences opposed to basic democratic principles if there is reasonable cause to believe that

(1) the organization has been suspended or expelled from, or is subject to other sanction by, a parent labor organization, or federation of organizations with which it has been affiliated, because it has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with governing requirements comparable in purpose to those required by subsection (a); or

(2) the organization is in fact subject to influences that would preclude recognition under this subchapter.
