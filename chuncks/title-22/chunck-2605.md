### CHAPTER 32— FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
#### § 2394b. HELP Commission
##### (b) Findings

(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing efforts and resources of the United States dedicated to helping needy people around the world, despair remains and in many areas is growing.

(2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring together the best minds associated with development and humanitarian assistance to make a comprehensive review of

(A) policy decisions, including why certain development projects are funded and others are not, successes, and best practices, including their applicability to other existing programs and projects;

(B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of United States agencies and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations;

(C) methodology, including whether the delivery of United States development assistance always represents best practices and whether it can be improved; and

(D) results, including measuring improvements in human capacity instead of in purely economic terms.

(3) An examination of these issues should present new approaches and ideas to ensure that United States development assistance reaches and benefits its intended recipients.
