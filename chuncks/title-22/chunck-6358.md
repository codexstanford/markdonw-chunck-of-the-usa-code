#### § 7846. Sense of Congress on humanitarian coordination related to the Korean Peninsula

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) any instability on the Korean Peninsula could have significant humanitarian and strategic impact on the region and for United States national interests; and

(2) as such, the United States Government should work with countries sharing a land or maritime border with North Korea to develop long-term whole-of-government plans to coordinate efforts related to humanitarian assistance and human rights promotion and to effectively assimilate North Korean defectors.
