### CHAPTER 73— INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
#### § 6443. Consultations
##### (b) Duty to consult with foreign governments prior to taking Presidential actions

(1) In general

The President shall

(A) request consultation with the government of such country regarding the violations giving rise to designation of that country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom or to Presidential action under section 6441 of this title ; and

(B) if agreed to, enter into such consultations, privately or publicly.

(2) Use of multilateral fora

If the President determines it to be appropriate, such consultations may be sought and may occur in a multilateral forum, but, in any event, the President shall consult with appropriate foreign governments for the purposes of achieving a coordinated international policy on actions that may be taken with respect to a country described in subsection (a), prior to implementing any such action.

(3) Election of nondisclosure of negotiations to public

If negotiations are undertaken or an agreement is concluded with a foreign government regarding steps to cease the pattern of violations by that government, and if public disclosure of such negotiations or agreement would jeopardize the negotiations or the implementation of such agreement, as the case may be, the President may refrain from disclosing such negotiations and such agreement to the public, except that the President shall inform the appropriate congressional committees of the nature and extent of such negotiations and any agreement reached.
