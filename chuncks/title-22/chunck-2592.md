#### § 2392. Government agencies
##### (g) Charge of expenses to appropriation or account

Any appropriation or account available to carry out provisions of subchapter I of this chapter may initially be charged in any fiscal year, within the limit of available funds, to finance expenses for which funds are available in other appropriations or accounts under subchapter I of this chapter: Provided, That as of the end of such fiscal year such expenses shall be finally charged to applicable appropriations or accounts with proper credit to the appropriations or accounts initially utilized for financing purposes: Provided further, That such final charge to applicable appropriations or accounts shall not be required in the case of expenses (other than those provided for under section 2397(a) of this title ) incurred in furnishing assistance by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter where it is determined that the accounting costs of identifying the applicable appropriation or account to which such expenses should be charged would be disproportionate to the advantage to be gained.
