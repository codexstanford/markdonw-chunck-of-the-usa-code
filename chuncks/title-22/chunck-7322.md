### CHAPTER 107— SUDAN DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND FISCAL TRANSPARENCY
#### § 10008. Multilateral assistance
##### (a) Sense of the Congress

It is the sense of the Congress that

(1) Sudan’s economic challenges are a legacy of decades of kleptocracy, economic mismanagement, and war;

(2) Sudan’s economic recovery will depend on

(A) combating corruption and illicit economic activity;

(B) ending internal conflicts in the states of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile; and

(C) promoting inclusive economic growth and development; and

(3) the COVID–19 outbreak constitutes a grave danger to Sudan’s economic stability, public health, and food security and jeopardizes the transition to a civilian-led government that promotes the democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people.
