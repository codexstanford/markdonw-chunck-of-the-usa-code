#### § 3682. Administration of certain disability benefits
##### (d) Cash relief payments to widows

The Commission may pay cash relief to the widow of any former employee of the Canal Zone Government or the Panama Canal Company who, until the time of his death, receives or has received cash relief under subsection (a) of this section, under section 181 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code (as in effect on September 30, 1979 ), or under the Act of July 8, 1937 , referred to in such subsection (a). The term “widow” as used in this subsection includes only the following:

(1) a woman legally married to such employee at the time of his termination for disability and at his death;

(2) a woman who, although not legally married to such former employee at the time of his termination, had resided continuously with him for at least five years immediately preceding the employee’s termination under such circumstances as would at common law make the relationship a valid marriage and who continued to reside with him until his death; and

(3) a woman who has not remarried or assumed a common-law relationship with any other person. Cash relief granted to such a widow shall not at any time exceed 50 percent of the rate at which cash relief, inclusive of any additional payment under subsection (b) of this section, would be payable to the former employee were he then alive.
