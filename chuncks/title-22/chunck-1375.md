#### § 1627. Creation of special funds in Treasury
##### (f) People’s Republic of China; claim payment priorities

(1) Out of sums covered after May 11, 1979 , into the special fund created pursuant to this section to receive funds paid by the People’s Republic of China, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make payments on account of awards certified by the Commission pursuant to subchapter V with respect to claims included within the terms of the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People’s Republic of China Concerning the Settlement of Claims, signed on May 11, 1979 , in the following order of priority:

(A) Payment in the amount of $1,000 or the principal amount of the award, whichever is less.

(B) Thereafter, except as provided in paragraph (2), to the extent there remain unpaid principal balances on awards, payments from time to time on account of the unpaid principal balance of each remaining award which bear to such unpaid principal balance the same proportion as the total amount available for distribution at the time such payments are made bears to the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all such awards.

(C) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the unpaid balance of each award of interest which bear to such unpaid balance of interest the same proportion as the total amount available for distribution at the time such payments are made bears to the aggregate unpaid balance of interest of all such awards.

(2)

(A) For the purpose of computing the payments to be made under paragraph (1) to any claimant which was an incorporated business enterprise on the date of nationalization or other taking of property, the award certified by the Commission under subchapter V shall be reduced by the amount of Federal tax benefits derived by such claimant on account of the losses upon which such claim was based, but in no case shall such payments be reduced below the amount paid to such claimant on account of such claim before October 13, 1980 . For purposes of this subparagraph, such Federal tax benefits shall be the amount by which the claimant’s taxes in any prior taxable year or years under chapters 1, 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, were decreased with respect to the loss or losses upon which the claim was based. The sum of the amounts which would otherwise be payable but for this paragraph which are not paid to any such claimant shall be aggregated, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make payments out of such aggregated sums in accordance with subparagraph (B).

(B) To the extent that there remain unpaid principal balances on awards to claimants which were, on the date of nationalization or other taking of property, nonprofit organizations operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, religious, charitable, or educational purposes (after payments made to such nonprofit organizations pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) are taken into account), the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make payments from time to time on account of the unpaid principal balance of each remaining award to such nonprofit organizations which bear to such unpaid principal balance the same proportion as the total sums aggregated pursuant to subparagraph (A) at the times such payments are made bear to the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all such awards to nonprofit organizations.
