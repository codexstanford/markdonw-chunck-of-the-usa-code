The Attorney General and the Secretary of State shall

(B) supporting and strengthening INTERPOL’s coordination with the Commission for Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) in cases in which INTERPOL or the CCF has determined that a member country issued a Notice, Diffusion, or other INTERPOL communication against an individual in violation of articles 2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Constitution, or the RPD, to prohibit such member country from seeking the publication or issuance of any subsequent Notices, Diffusions, or other INTERPOL communication against the same individual based on the same set of claims or facts;

(C) increasing, to the extent practicable, dedicated funding to the CCF and the Notices and Diffusions Task Force in order to further expand operations related to the review of requests for red notices and red diffusions;

(D) supporting candidates for positions within INTERPOL’s structures, including the Presidency, Executive Committee, General Secretariat, and CCF who have demonstrated experience relating to and respect for the rule of law;

(E) seeking to require INTERPOL in its annual report to provide a detailed account, disaggregated by member country or entity of

(i) the number of Notice requests, disaggregated by color, that it received;

(ii) the number of Notice requests, disaggregated by color, that it rejected;

(iii) the category of violation identified in each instance of a rejected Notice;

(iv) the number of Diffusions that it cancelled without reference to decisions by the CCF; and

(v) the sources of all INTERPOL income during the reporting period; and

(F) supporting greater transparency by the CCF in its annual report by providing a detailed account, disaggregated by country, of

(i) the number of admissible requests for correction or deletion of data received by the CCF regarding issued Notices, Diffusions, and other INTERPOL communications; and

(ii) the category of violation alleged in each such complaint;

(2) inform the INTERPOL General Secretariat about incidents in which member countries abuse INTERPOL communications for politically motivated or other unlawful purposes so that, as appropriate, action can be taken by INTERPOL; and
