#### § 7813. Radio broadcasting to North Korea
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that the United States should

(1) facilitate the unhindered dissemination of information in North Korea by increasing its support for broadcasting, including news rebroadcasting, to North Korea, and that the Broadcasting Board of Governors should increase such broadcasts, including news rebroadcasts, to North Korea from current levels, with a goal of providing 12-hour-per-day broadcasting to North Korea, including broadcasts by Radio Free Asia and Voice of America; and

(2) expand funding for nongovernmental organization broadcasting efforts, prioritizing organizations that engage North Korean defectors in programming and broadcast services.
