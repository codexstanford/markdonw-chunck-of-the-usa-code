#### § 8513a. Imposition of sanctions with respect to the financial sector of Iran
##### (a) Findings

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) On November 21, 2011 , the Secretary of the Treasury issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31 that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.

(2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, “The Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several billion dollars to designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, through a variety of payment schemes. In making these transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct involvement of large international banks with both CBI and designated Iranian banks.”.

(3) On November 22, 2011 , the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, wrote, “Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering risks for the global financial system.”.
