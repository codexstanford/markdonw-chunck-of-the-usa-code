##### (b) Overseas evacuations

The Secretary of State shall develop and implement policies and programs to provide for the safe and efficient evacuation of United States Government personnel, dependents, and private United States citizens when their lives are endangered.

In carrying out these responsibilities, the Secretary shall

(1) develop a model contingency plan for evacuation of personnel, dependents, and United States citizens from foreign countries;

(2) develop a mechanism whereby United States citizens can voluntarily request to be placed on a list in order to be contacted in the event of an evacuation, or which, in the event of an evacuation, can maintain information on the location of United States citizens in high risk areas submitted by their relatives;

(3) assess the transportation and communications resources in the area being evacuated and determine the logistic support needed for the evacuation; and

(4) develop a plan for coordinating communications between embassy staff, Department of State personnel, and families of United States citizens abroad regarding the whereabouts of those citizens.
