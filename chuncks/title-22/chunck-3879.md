### CHAPTER 49— SUPPORT OF PEACE TREATY BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL
#### § 3402. Supplemental authorization of foreign military sales loan guaranties for Egypt and Israel
##### (a) Congressional findings; use of Arms Export Control Act procedures

The Congress finds that the legitimate defense interests of Israel and Egypt require a one time extraordinary assistance package due to Israel’s phased withdrawal from the Sinai and Egypt’s shift from reliance on Soviet weaponry. The authorizations contained in this section do not, however, constitute Congressional approval of the sale of any particular weapons system to either country. These sales will be reviewed under the normal procedures set forth in section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [ 22 U.S.C. 2776(b) ].
