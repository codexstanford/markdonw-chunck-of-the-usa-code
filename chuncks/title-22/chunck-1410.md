An interest in property vested under the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, as the property of a corporation organized under the laws of Bulgaria, Hungary, or Rumania shall be subject to return under subsection (a) of this section only if a notice of claim for the return of any such interest has been timely filed under the provisions of section 4330 of Title 50 , provided that application may be made therefore within six months after July 24, 1968 . In the event such interest has been liquidated and the net proceeds thereof transferred to the Bulgarian Claims Fund, Hungarian Claims Fund, or Rumanian Claims Fund, the net proceeds of any other interest representing vested property held in the United States Treasury may be used for the purpose of making the return hereunder.
