### CHAPTER 109— BURMA UNIFIED THROUGH RIGOROUS MILITARY ACCOUNTABILITY
#### § 10224. Support for greater United Nations action with respect to Burma
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the United Nations Security Council has not taken adequate steps to condemn the February 1, 2021 , coup in Burma, pressure the Burmese military to cease its violence against civilians, or secure the release of those unjustly detained;

(2) countries, such as the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, that are directly or indirectly shielding the Burmese military from international scrutiny and action, should be obliged to endure the reputational damage of doing so by taking public votes on resolutions related to Burma that apply greater pressure on the Burmese military to restore Burma to its democratic path; and

(3) the United Nations Secretariat and the United Nations Security Council should take concrete steps to address the coup and ongoing crisis in Burma consistent with United Nations General Assembly resolution 75/287, “The situation in Myanmar,” which was adopted on June 18, 2021 .
