#### § 2277a. Targeted sanctions to fight corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala,, 1 Honduras, and Nicaragua
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala,, 1 Honduras, and Nicaragua by private citizens and select officials in local, regional, and Federal governments significantly damages the economies of such countries and deprives citizens of opportunities;

(2) corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala,, 1 Honduras, and Nicaragua is facilitated and carried out not only by private citizens and select officials from those countries but also in many instances by individuals from third countries; and

(3) imposing targeted sanctions on individuals from throughout the world and particularly in the Western Hemisphere who are engaged in acts of significant corruption that impact El Salvador, Guatemala,, 1 Honduras, and Nicaragua or obstruction of investigations into such acts of corruption will benefit the citizens and governments of such countries.
