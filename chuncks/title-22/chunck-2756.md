### CHAPTER 32— FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
#### § 2431. Findings and purposes
##### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this subchapter are

(1) to recognize the values received by United States citizens from protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems;

(2) to facilitate greater protection of tropical forests and coral ecosystems (and to give priority to protecting areas with the highest levels of biodiversity and under the most severe threat) by providing for the alleviation of debt in countries where tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems are located, thus allowing the use of additional resources to protect these critical resources and reduce economic pressures that have led to deforestation;

(3) to ensure that resources freed from debt in such countries are targeted to protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems and their associated values; and

(4) to rechannel existing resources to facilitate the protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems.
