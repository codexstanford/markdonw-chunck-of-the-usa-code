#### § 4046. Computation of annuities
##### (b) Married participants

(1)

(A) Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 60), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for his or her spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 4054(b) of this title , or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.

(B) At the time of retirement, a married participant or former participant and his or her spouse may jointly elect in writing to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section (or under section 4054(b) of this title if the spouse later qualifies as a former spouse under section 4044(6) of this title ), or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section (or section 4054(b) of this title ) by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor benefit. In the event the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 4054(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant’s annuity designated under this subparagraph.

(C) If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, the participant and such former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 4060(b)(1) of this title to waive a survivor annuity under section 4054(b) of this title for that former spouse if the election is made (i) before the end of the 24-month period after the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final or (ii) at the time of retirement, whichever occurs first.

(D) The Secretary of State may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant’s spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.

(2) The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor benefit under this section (or section 4054(b) of this title ), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 2½ percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 4054(a)(5) of this title .

(3)

(A) If a former participant entitled to receive a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant’s annuity computed under subsection (a), or 55 percent of any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor benefit under paragraph (1)(B).

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor benefits which remains available under section 4054(b)(4)(B) of this title .

(C) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.
