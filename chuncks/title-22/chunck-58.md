#### § 262k. Financial assistance to international financial institutions; considerations and criteria
##### (a) Congressional declaration of intent

United States active participation in international financial institution activity is based on our national objective of furthering the economic and social development of the nations of the world, in particular the developing nations. The attainment of this national objective is most effectively realized through a world economic and financial system which is both free and stable. Therefore, it is the intent of the United States Congress that United States financial assistance to the international financial institutions should be primarily directed to those projects that would not generate excess commodity supplies in world markets, displace private investment initiatives or foster departures from a market-oriented economy.
