##### (i) Sales affecting combat readiness of Armed Forces; statement to Congress; limitation on delivery

(1) Sales of defense articles and defense services which could have significant adverse effect on the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be kept to an absolute minimum. The President shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Armed Services of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations of the Senate on the same day a written statement giving a complete explanation with respect to any proposal to sell, under this section or under authority of subchapter II–B, any defense articles or defense services if such sale could have a significant adverse effect on the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States. Each such statement shall be unclassified except to the extent that public disclosure of any item of information contained therein would be clearly detrimental to the security of the United States. Any necessarily classified information shall be confined to a supplemental report. Each such statement shall include an explanation relating to only one such proposal to sell and shall set forth

(A) the country or international organization to which the sale is proposed to be made;

(B) the amount of the proposed sale;

(C) a description of the defense article or service proposed to be sold;

(D) a full description of the impact which the proposed sale will have on the Armed Forces of the United States; and

A certification described in subparagraph (E) shall take effect on the date on which such certification is transmitted and shall remain in effect for not to exceed one year.

(2) No delivery may be made under any sale which is required to be reported under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the certification required to be transmitted by paragraph  1 (E) of paragraph (1) is in effect.
