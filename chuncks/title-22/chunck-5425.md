### CHAPTER 69A— CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY (LIBERTAD)
#### § 6040. Importation safeguard against certain Cuban products
##### (b) Effect of NAFTA

The Congress notes that United States accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement does not modify or alter the United States sanctions against Cuba. The statement of administrative action accompanying that trade agreement specifically states the following:

(1) “The NAFTA rules of origin will not in any way diminish the Cuban sanctions program. … Nothing in the NAFTA would operate to override this prohibition.”.

(2) “Article 309(3) [of the NAFTA] permits the United States to ensure that Cuban products or goods made from Cuban materials are not imported into the United States from Mexico or Canada and that United States products are not exported to Cuba through those countries.”.
