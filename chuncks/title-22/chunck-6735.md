#### § 8807. Impositions of sanctions with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting
##### (a) Findings

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting has contributed to the infringement of individuals’ human rights by broadcasting forced televised confession and show trials.

(2) In March 2012, the European Council imposed sanctions on the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, Ezzatollah Zargami, for broadcasting forced confessions of detainees and a series of “show trials” in August 2009 and December 2011 that constituted a clear violation of international law with respect to the right to a fair trial and due process.
