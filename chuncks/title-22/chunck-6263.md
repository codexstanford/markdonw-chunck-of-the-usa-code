### CHAPTER 84— MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE
#### § 7706. Eligible countries
##### (a) Determination by the Board

The Board shall determine whether a candidate country is an eligible country for purposes of this section. Such determination shall be based, to the maximum extent possible, upon objective and quantifiable indicators of a country’s demonstrated commitment to the criteria in subsection (b), and shall, where appropriate, take into account and assess the role of women and girls. A determination whether a country is eligible for a subsequent, non-concurrent Millennium Challenge Compact shall also be based, to the extent practicable, on significantly improved performance across the criteria in subsection (b) that, at a minimum, are relevant to the preceding Compact, compared to the country’s performance with respect to such criteria when selected for such preceding Compact.
