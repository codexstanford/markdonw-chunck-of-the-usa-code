### CHAPTER 48A— TAIWAN ENHANCED RESILIENCE
#### § 3357. Findings and statement of policy
##### (a) Findings

Congress finds the following:

(1) Advancing peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific has been a central element of United States foreign policy toward the region.

(2) The Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), especially since the election of Tsai Ing-Wen in 2016, has conducted a coordinated campaign to weaken Taiwan diplomatically, economically, and militarily in a manner that threatens to erode United States policy and create a fait accompli on questions surrounding Taiwan’s future.

(3) To secure United States interests and preserve the ability of the people of Taiwan to determine their own future, it is necessary to reinforce Taiwan’s diplomatic, economic, and territorial space.
