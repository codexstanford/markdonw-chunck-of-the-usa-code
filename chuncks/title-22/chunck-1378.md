#### § 1631a. Property owned by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania or any national thereof
##### (a) Vesting of property; liquidation; disposition of net proceeds

In accordance with article 25 of the treaty of peace with Bulgaria, article 29 of the treaty of peace with Hungary, and article 27 of the treaty of peace with Rumania, any property which was blocked in accordance with Executive Order 8389 of April 10, 1940 , as amended, and remains blocked on August 9, 1955 , and which, as of September 15, 1947 , was owned directly or indirectly by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania or by any national thereof as defined in such Executive order, shall vest in such officer or agency as the President may from time to time designate and shall vest when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee shall direct. Such property shall be sold or otherwise liquidated as expeditiously as possible after vesting under such rules and regulations as the President or his designee may prescribe. The net proceeds remaining upon completion of the administration and liquidation thereof, including the adjudication of any suits or claims with respect thereto under sections 1631f and 1631g of this title, shall be covered into the Treasury. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, any such property determined by the President or his designee to be owned directly by a natural person shall not be vested under this subsection but shall remain blocked subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe. If, at any time within one year from the date of the vesting of any property under this subsection, the President or his designee shall determine that it was directly owned at the date of vesting by a natural person, then the President or his designee shall divest such property and restore it to its blocked status prior to vesting, subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe, or if such property has been liquidated, shall divest the net proceeds thereof and carry them in blocked accounts with the Treasury, bearing no interest, in the name of the owner thereof at the date of vesting, subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe.
