#### § 276c–6. Supporting the employment of United States citizens by international organizations
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the Department should continue to eliminate the unreasonable barriers United States nationals face to obtain employment in the United Nations Secretariat, funds, programs, and agencies; and

(2) the Department should bolster efforts to increase the number of qualified United States nationals who are candidates for leadership and oversight positions in the United Nations system, agencies, and commissions, and in other international organizations.
