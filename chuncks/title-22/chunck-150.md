#### § 262p–4a. Loan programs to reduce economic dependence on illicit narcotics
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) the illicit narcotics epidemic currently afflicting the United States represents a direct threat to the well-being of every United States citizen;

(2) every effective means must be pursued to reduce the foreign production and subsequent importation into the United States of illicit narcotics;

(3) the multilateral development banks can play an integral role in efforts to control the production of illicit narcotics;

(4) producer country narcotics eradication programs will not be effective unless such programs provide an economic alternative to the production of narcotics;

(5) efforts to address the illicit narcotics epidemic through production control are doomed to failure unless greater effort is applied to curb use of and demand for illicit narcotics; and

(6) the appropriate role for the multilateral development banks in the “War Against Drugs” is through coordinating and financing alternative economic opportunities in producer and trafficking countries.
