#### § 9711. Humanitarian relief for the Venezuelan people
##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(1) the United States Government should expand efforts to peacefully address Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis; and

(2) humanitarian assistance

(A) should be targeted toward those most in need and delivered through partners that uphold internationally recognized humanitarian principles; and

(B) should not be passed through the control or distribution mechanisms of the Maduro regime.
