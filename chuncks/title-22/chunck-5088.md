#### § 5331. International initiative
##### (a) Directive

(1) Study

The Secretary of the Treasury shall study the feasibility and advisability of establishing the International Debt Management Authority described in this section.

(2) Explanation of determinations

If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that initiation of international discussions with regard to such authority would (A) result in material increase in the discount at which sovereign debt is sold, (B) materially increase the probability of default on such debt, or (C) materially enhance the likelihood of debt service failure or disruption, the Secretary shall include in his interim reports to the Congress an explanation in detail of the reasons for such determination.

(3) Initiation of discussions

Unless such a determination is made, the Secretary of the Treasury shall initiate discussions with such industrialized and developing countries as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate with the intent to negotiate the establishment of the International Debt Management Authority, which would undertake to

(A) purchase sovereign debt of less developed countries from private creditors at an appropriate discount;

(B) enter into negotiations with the debtor countries for the purpose of restructuring the debt in order to

(i) ease the current debt service burden on the debtor countries; and

(ii) provide additional opportunities for economic growth in both debtor and industrialized countries; and

(C) assist the creditor banks in the voluntary disposition of their Third World loan portfolio.
