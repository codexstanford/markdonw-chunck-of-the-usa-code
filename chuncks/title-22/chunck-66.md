##### (a) Environmental reform measures; instructions to Executive Directors of Multilateral Development Banks

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors of the Multilateral Development Banks to

(1) vigorously promote a commitment of these institutions to

(A) add professionally trained staff with experience in ecology and related areas to undertake environmental review of projects, and strengthen existing staff exercising environmental responsibilities;

(B) develop and implement management plans to ensure systematic and thorough environmental review of all projects and activities affecting the ecology and natural resources of borrowing countries, including

(i) creation of a line unit to carry out such reviews as part of the normal project cycle,

(ii) appointment of an environmental advisor to the Presidents of the Multilateral Development Banks,

(iii) institution of a regular program of monitoring all ongoing projects to ensure that contract conditions and general bank policies to protect the environment and indigenous peoples are fully complied with;

(C) create career and other institutional incentives for all professionally trained bank staff to incorporate environmental and natural resources concerns into project planning and country programming activities;

(2) vigorously promote changes in these institutions in their preparation of projects and country programs that will prompt staff and encourage borrower countries to

(A) actively and regularly involve environmental and health ministers, or comparable representatives, at the national, regional and local level, in the preparation of environmentally sensitive projects and in bank-supported country program planning and strategy sessions;

(B) actively and regularly seek the participation of non-governmental indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the host countries at all stages of project planning and strategy sessions;

(C) fully inform local communities and appropriate non-governmental organizations with interests in local development projects of all project planning sufficiently in advance of project appraisal to allow informed participation of local communities and non-governmental organizations that may be adversely affected by them;

(3) establish a regular integrated multidisciplinary planning process to conduct land use capability analyses in reviewing potential loans. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to, a review of ongoing or other potential resource utilization efforts in and adjacent to the project area;

(4) vigorously promote a commitment of these institutions to develop and implement plans for the rehabilitation and management of the ecological resources of borrower nations on a sustained basis. Special attention shall be paid to soil conservation, wildlife, wetlands, estuaries, croplands, grasslands, forests, and fisheries, including

(A) long-term programs of research designed to manage ecosystems properly;

(B) provision of adequate extension workers, park rangers, social forestry experts, and other appropriate personnel; and

(C) improved programs of training in environmental science and land-use planning;

(5) vigorously promote a commitment of these institutions to increase the proportion of their programs supporting environmentally beneficial projects and project components, such as technical assistance for environmental ministries and institutions, resource rehabilitation projects and project components, protection of indigenous peoples, and appropriate light capital technology projects. Other examples of such projects include small scale mixed farming and multiple cropping, agroforestry, programs to promote kitchen gardens, watershed management and rehabilitation, high yield wood lots, integrated pest management systems, dune stabilization programs, programs to improve energy efficiency, energy efficient technologies such as small scale hydro projects, rural solar energy systems, and rural and mobile telecommunications systems, and improved efficiency and management of irrigation systems. 1

(6) place an increased emphasis on upgrading the efficient use of energy and other resources by borrower nations. Such efforts shall include, but not be limited to

(A) significantly increasing the proportion of energy project lending for energy efficiency improvements, and decentralized small scale facilities such as solar, wind, or biomass generating facilities; and

(B) conducting an analysis of the comparative costs of any new energy generating facilities with the cost of increasing the energy efficiency in the project service area;

(7) seek a commitment of these institutions to fund projects to protect and preserve crucial wetland systems and to avoid expenditures for projects designed to convert major wetland systems. Development proposals which may affect these areas should be the subject of detailed impact assessments so as to avoid detrimental impacts to fisheries, wildlife and other important resources;

(8) vigorously promote the establishment within the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank of a component which provides training in environmental and natural resource planning and program development;

(9) regularly raise, at meetings of the Boards of Directors of these institutions, the issue of their progress in improving their environmental performance, with specific focus on the measures set forth above; and

(10) require at least a four week project review period between the time when staff recommendations are presented to the board and board action on any projects.
