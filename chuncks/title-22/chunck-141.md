#### § 262p–1. Grassroots Collaboration Program
##### (c) Flexible financing; initial grant

To the extent the activities under the Grassroots Collaboration Program described in subsection (a) need more flexible financing, it is the sense of the Congress that

(1) such activities could be funded through a grant from the net income of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and

(2) an initial grant of not less than $50,000,000 should be made for such activities with subsequent annual allocations of such additional amounts as may be necessary to allow the Grassroots Collaboration Program to maximize collaboration with nongovernmental organizations in the alleviation of poverty and the protection of the environment.
