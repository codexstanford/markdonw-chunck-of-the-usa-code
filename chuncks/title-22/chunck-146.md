(2) recognize and support women’s direct and indirect roles in the economic development of their countries and communities;

(3) recognize and support women’s direct and indirect roles in the education and social development of, the maintenance of the health of, and in the provision of adequate nutrition for, family members and communities, especially children;

(4) work to remove legal and customary barriers which impede the full participation of women in economic and social development, such as lack of access to credit, property rights, education, health care, and government services; and
