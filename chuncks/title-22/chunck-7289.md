##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that the President, the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies should

(1) develop more adaptive and responsive policy and program planning, implementation, and scaling under the Global Fragility Strategy established pursuant to section 9803 of this title , and work with the appropriate congressional committees to identify any legislative changes that may be necessary to support such efforts;

(2) better integrate the strategy and other conflict and violence reduction objectives and activities into other policy and program areas, where appropriate; and

(3) support transparent and accountable multilateral funds, initiatives, and strategies to enhance and better coordinate private and public efforts to stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent violence and fragility globally.
