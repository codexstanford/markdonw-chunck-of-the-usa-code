##### (a) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that some INTERPOL member countries have repeatedly misused INTERPOL’s databases and processes, including Notice and Diffusion mechanisms, to conduct activities of an overtly political or other unlawful character and in violation of international human rights standards, including by making requests to harass or persecute political opponents, human rights defenders, or journalists.
