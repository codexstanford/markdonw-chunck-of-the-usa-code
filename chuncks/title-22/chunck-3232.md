#### § 2697. Acceptance of gifts on behalf of United States
##### (b) Disposition

Any unconditional gift of money accepted under subsection (a), the income from any gift property held under subsection (c) or (d) (except income made available for expenditure under subsection (d)(2)), the net proceeds from the liquidation of gift property under subsection (c) or (d), and the proceeds of insurance on any gift property which are not used for its restoration, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States. Such funds are hereby appropriated and shall be held in trust by the Secretary of the Treasury for the benefit of the Department of State (including the Foreign Service). The Secretary of the Treasury may invest and reinvest such funds in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Such funds and the income from such investments shall be available for expenditure in the operation of the Department of State (including the Foreign Service) and the performance of its functions, subject to the same examination and audit as is provided for appropriations made for the Foreign Service by the Congress, but shall not be expended for representational purposes at United States missions except in accordance with the conditions that apply to appropriated funds.
