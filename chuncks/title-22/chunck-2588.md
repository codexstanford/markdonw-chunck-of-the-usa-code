#### § 2392. Government agencies
##### (c) Reimbursement for commodities, services, and facilities

In the case of any commodity, service, or facility procured from any agency of the United States Government to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, reimbursement or payment shall be made to such agency from funds available to carry out such subchapter. Such reimbursement or payment shall be at replacement cost, or, if required by law, at actual cost, or, in the case of services procured from the Department of Defense to carry out part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, the amount of the additional costs incurred by the Department of Defense in providing such services, or at any other price authorized by law and agreed to by the owning or disposing agency. The amount of any such reimbursement or payment shall be credited to current applicable appropriations, funds, or accounts, from which there may be procured replacements of similar commodities, services, or facilities, except that where such appropriations, funds, or accounts are not reimbursable except by reason of this subsection, and when the owning or disposing agency determines that such replacement is not necessary, any funds received in payment therefor shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
