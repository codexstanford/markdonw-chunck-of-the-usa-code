#### § 262p–4i. Multilateral development banks and debt-for-nature exchanges
##### (b) Negotiation of guidelines for restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies

The United States Executive Directors of the multilateral development banks shall seek to negotiate with the other executive directors to provide guidelines for restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies. Pending the outcome of such negotiations, the United States Executive Directors shall consider restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies to be those which

(1) support development that maintains and restores the renewable natural resource base so that present and future needs of debtor countries’ populations can be met, while not impairing critical ecosystems and not exacerbating global environmental problems;

(2) are environmentally sustainable in that resources are conserved and managed in an effort to remove pressure on the natural resource base and to make judicious use of the land so as to sustain growth and the availability of all natural resources;

(3) support development that does not exceed the limits imposed by local hydrological cycles, soil, climate, vegetation, and human cultural practices;

(4) promote the maintenance and restoration of soils, vegetation, hydrological cycles, wildlife, critical ecosystems (tropical forests, wetlands, and coastal marine resources), biological diversity and other natural resources essential to economic growth and human well-being and shall, when using natural resources, be implemented to minimize the depletion of such natural resources; and

(5) take steps, wherever feasible, to prevent pollution that threatens human health and important biotic systems and to achieve patterns of energy consumption that meet human needs and rely on renewable resources.
