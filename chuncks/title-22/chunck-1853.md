#### § 2151v. Aid to relatively least developed countries
##### (a) Characterization of least developed countries

Relatively least developed countries (as determined on the basis of criteria comparable to those used for the United Nations General Assembly list of “least developed countries”) are characterized by extreme poverty, very limited infrastructure, and limited administrative capacity to implement basic human needs growth strategies. In such countries special measures may be necessary to insure the full effectiveness of assistance furnished under subchapter I of this chapter.
