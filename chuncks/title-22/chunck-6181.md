### CHAPTER 83— UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA
#### § 7622. Participation in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
##### (a) Findings; sense of Congress

(1) Findings

Congress makes the following findings:

(A) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 ( Public Law 106–264 ) [ 22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].

(B) The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which

(i) has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and

(ii) represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.

(C) The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs

(i) are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and

(ii) often work most effectively in concert with each other.

(D) The United States Government

(i) is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;

(ii) made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and

(iii) is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.

(2) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that

(A) transparency and accountability are crucial to the long-term success and viability of the Global Fund;

(B) the Global Fund has made significant progress toward addressing concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office by

(i) improving risk assessment and risk management capabilities;

(ii) providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and

(iii) strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;

(C) the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;

(D) regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;

(E) the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track

(i) the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant’s fiscal cycle; and

(ii) the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;

(F) relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;

(G) the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;

(H) for purposes of evaluating total amounts of funds contributed to the Global Fund under subsection (d)(4)(A)(i), the timetable for evaluations of contributions from sources other than the United States should take into account the fiscal calendars of other major contributors; and

(I) the Global Fund should not support activities involving the “Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria” or similar entities pending compelling evidence of success from pilot programs as evaluated by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.
