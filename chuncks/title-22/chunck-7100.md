Congress makes the following findings:

(A) The Government of the Russian Federation uses its strong position in the energy sector as leverage to manipulate the internal politics and foreign relations of the countries of Europe and Eurasia.

It is the sense of Congress that

(A) the United States should assist the efforts of the countries of Europe and Eurasia to enhance their energy security through diversification of energy supplies in order to lessen dependencies on Russian Federation energy resources and state-owned entities; and

(B) the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the United States International Development Finance Corporation should play key roles in supporting critical energy projects that contribute to that goal.

(3) Use of Countering Russian Influence Fund to provide technical assistance

Amounts in the Countering Russian Influence Fund pursuant to section 9543 of this title shall be used to provide technical advice to countries described in subsection (b)(1) of such section designed to enhance energy security and lessen dependence on energy from Russian Federation sources.
