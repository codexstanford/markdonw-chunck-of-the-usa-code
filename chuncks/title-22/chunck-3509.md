#### § 2770a. Exchange of training and related support
##### (b) Reciprocal arrangements; reimbursement

Training and related support may be provided under this section only pursuant to an agreement or other arrangement providing for the provision by the recipient foreign country or international organization, on a reciprocal basis, of comparable training and related support to military and civilian personnel under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the military department providing the training and related support under this section. Such reciprocal training and related support must be provided within a reasonable period of time (which may not be more than one year) of the provision of training and related support by the United States. To the extent that a foreign country or international organization to which training and related support is provided under this section does not provide such comparable training and related support to the United States within a reasonable period of time, that country or international organization shall be required to reimburse the United States for the full costs of the training and related support provided by the United States.
