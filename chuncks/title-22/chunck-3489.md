#### § 2766. Security assistance surveys
##### (a) Statement of findings and policy

The Congress finds that security assistance surveys prepared by the United States for foreign countries have had a significant impact on subsequent military procurement decisions of those countries. It is the policy of the United States that the results of security assistance surveys conducted by the United States clearly do not represent a commitment by the United States to provide any military equipment to any foreign country. Further, recommendations in such surveys should be consistent with the arms export control policy provided for in this chapter.
