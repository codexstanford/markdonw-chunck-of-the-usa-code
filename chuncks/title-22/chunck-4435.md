(2) A participant may make a special contribution for any period or periods of approved leave without pay while serving before November 7, 1976 , as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of Government employees. Any such contribution shall be based upon the suspended Foreign Service salary rate and shall be computed in accordance with section 4045 of this title . A participant who makes such contributions shall be allowed full retirement credit for the period or periods of leave without pay. If this contribution is not made, up to 6 months’ retirement credit shall be allowed for such periods of leave without pay each calendar year.
