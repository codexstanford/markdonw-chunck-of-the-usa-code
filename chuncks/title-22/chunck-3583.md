(1) Under the direction of the President and in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a Special Defense Acquisition Fund (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the “Fund”), to be used as a revolving fund separate from other accounts, under the control of the Department of Defense, to finance the acquisition of defense articles and defense service in anticipation of their transfer pursuant to this chapter, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [ 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], or as otherwise authorized by law, to eligible foreign countries and international organizations, and may acquire such articles and services with the funds in the Fund as he may determine. Acquisition under this subchapter of items for which the initial issue quantity requirements for United States Armed Forces have not been fulfilled and are not under current procurement contract shall be emphasized when compatible with security assistance requirements for the transfer of such items.

(2) Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to limit or impair any responsibilities conferred upon the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense under this chapter or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [ 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.].

(3) The Fund may be used to keep on continuous order such defense articles and defense services as are assigned by the Department of Defense for integrated management by a single agency thereof for the common use of all military departments in anticipation of the transfer of similar defense articles and defense services to foreign countries and international organizations pursuant to this chapter, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [ 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], or other law.

(4) The Fund shall also be used to acquire defense articles that are particularly suited for use for narcotics control purposes and are appropriate to the needs of recipient countries, such as small boats, planes (including helicopters), and communications equipment.
