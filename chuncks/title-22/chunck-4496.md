##### (c) Period of entitlement; construction with other provisions; application approval and payment

(1) The entitlement of a former spouse to benefits under this section

(A) shall commence on the later of

(ii) the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final; and

(B) shall terminate on the earlier of

(i) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age; or

(ii) the date of the benefits of the participant terminates.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant

(A) the benefits of the former spouse shall commence on the date the participant would qualify on the basis of his or her creditable service for benefits under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and

(B) the amount of benefits of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of benefits for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.

(3) Benefits under this section shall be treated the same as an annuity under section 4054(a)(7) of this title for purposes of section 4046(h) of this title or any comparable provision of law.

(4)

(A) Benefits under this section shall not be payable unless appropriate written application is provided to the Secretary, complete with any supporting documentation which the Secretary may by regulation require, within 30 months after the effective date of this section. The Secretary may waive the 30-month application requirement under this subparagraph in any case in which the Secretary determines that the circumstances so warrant.

(B) Upon approval of an application provided under subparagraph (A), the appropriate benefits shall be payable to the former spouse with respect to all periods before such approval during which the former spouse was entitled to such benefits under this section, but in no event shall benefits be payable under this section with respect to any period before the effective date of this section.
