### CHAPTER 38— DEPARTMENT OF STATE
#### § 2664a. Protection of Civil Service employees
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department of State is dependent not only on the contribution of Foreign Service employees but equally on the contribution of the 42 percent of the Department’s employees who are employed under the Civil Service personnel system;

(2) the contribution of these Civil Service employees has been overlooked in the management of the Department and greater equality of promotion, training, and career enhancement opportunities should be accorded to the Civil Service employees of the Department; and

(3) a goal of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [ 22 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.] was to strengthen the contribution made by Civil Service employees of the Department of State by creating a cadre of experienced specialists and managers in the Department to provide essential continuity.
