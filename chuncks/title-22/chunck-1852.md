### CHAPTER 32— FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
#### § 2151u. Private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives in overseas development
##### (h) Promotion of democratic cooperatives

The Congress recognizes that, in addition to their role in social and economic development, cooperatives provide an opportunity for people to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Therefore, assistance under this part shall be provided to rural and urban cooperatives which offer large numbers of low- and middle-income people in developing countries an opportunity to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Such assistance shall be designed to encourage the adoption of self-help, private sector cooperative techniques and practices which have been successful in the United States.
