#### § 2311. General authority
##### (a) Defense articles and services; noncombatant personnel; transfer of funds

The President is authorized to furnish military assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to any friendly country or international organization, the assisting of which the President finds will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace and which is otherwise eligible to receive such assistance, by

(1) acquiring for any source and providing (by loan or grant) any defense article or defense service;

(2) assigning or detailing members of the Armed Forces of the United States and other personnel of the Department of Defense to perform duties of a noncombatant nature; or

(3) transferring such of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this part as the President may determine for assistance to a recipient country, to the account in which funds for the procurement of defense articles and defense services under section 21 and section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act [ 22 U.S.C. 2761 and 2762] have been deposited for such recipient, to be merged with such deposited funds, and to be used solely to meet obligations of the recipient for payment for sales under that Act [ 22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.]. Sales which are wholly paid from funds transferred under paragraph (3) or from funds made available on a non-repayable basis under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act [ 22 U.S.C. 2763 ] shall be priced to exclude the costs of salaries of members of the Armed Forces of the United States (other than the Coast Guard).
