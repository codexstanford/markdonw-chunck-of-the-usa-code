#### § 4055. Lump-sum payments
##### (f) Order of precedence for payments

Payments under subsections (c) through (e) shall be paid in the following order of precedence to individuals surviving the participant and alive on the date entitlement to the payment arises, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person:

(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries last designated by the participant before or after retirement in a signed and witnessed writing filed with the Secretary of State prior to the death of the participant, for which purpose a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document which is not so executed and filed shall have no force or effect.

(2) If there is no such beneficiary, to the surviving wife or husband of the participant.

(3) If none of the above, to the child (without regard to the definition in section 4044(2) of this title ) or children of the participant (including adopted and natural children but not stepchildren) and descendants of deceased children by representation.

(4) If none of the above, to the parents of the participant or the survivor of them.

(5) If none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the participant.

(6) If none of the above, to such other next of kin of the participant as may be determined in the judgment of the Secretary of State to be legally entitled to such payment, except that no payment shall be made under this paragraph until after the expiration of 30 days after the death of the participant or annuitant.
