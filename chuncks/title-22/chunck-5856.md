### CHAPTER 76— ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES WITH LARGE POPULATIONS HAVING HIV/AIDS
#### § 6811. Coordinated donor strategy for support and education of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa
##### (a) Statement of policy

It is in the national interest of the United States to assist in mitigating the burden that will be placed on sub-Saharan African social, economic, and political institutions as these institutions struggle with the consequences of a dramatically increasing AIDS orphan population, many of whom are themselves infected by HIV and living with AIDS. Effectively addressing that burden and its consequences in sub-Saharan Africa will require a coordinated multidonor strategy.
