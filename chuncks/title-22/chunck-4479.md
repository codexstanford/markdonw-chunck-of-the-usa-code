#### § 4067. Compatibility between retirement systems
##### (a) Civil Service and Foreign Service Retirement Systems

In order to maintain existing conformity between the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, and the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System, whenever a law of general applicability is enacted which

(1) affects the treatment of current or former participants, annuitants, or survivors under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System; and

(2) affects treatment which, immediately prior to the enactment of such law, was substantially identical to the treatment accorded to participants, former participants, annuitants, or survivors under the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System; such law shall be extended in accordance with subsection (b) to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System so that it applies in like manner with respect to participants, former participants, annuitants, or survivors under that System.
