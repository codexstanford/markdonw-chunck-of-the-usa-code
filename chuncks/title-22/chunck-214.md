(A) debt treatment benchmarks designed to achieve debt sustainability for each participating debtor;

(B) standards for appropriate burden-sharing among all creditors with material claims on each participating debtor, without regard for their official, private, or hybrid status;

(C) robust debt disclosure by creditors, including the People’s Republic of China, and debtor countries, including inter-creditor data-sharing and, to the maximum extent practicable, public disclosure of material terms and conditions of claims on participating debtors;

(D) expansion of Common Framework country eligibility to lower middle-income countries who otherwise meet the existing criteria;

(E) improvements to the Common Framework process with the aim of ensuring access to debt relief in a timely manner for those countries eligible and who request treatment; and

(2) engage with international financial institutions and official and commercial creditors to advance support, as the Secretary finds appropriate, for debt restructuring or debt relief for each participating debtor, including, on a case-by- case basis, a debt standstill, if requested by the debtor country through the Common Framework process from the time of conclusion of a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund, and until the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding with its creditor committee pursuant to the Common Framework, or any successor framework or similar coordinated international debt treatment process in which the United States participates; and

(3) instruct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund and the United States Executive Director at the World Bank to use the voice and vote of the United States to advance the efforts described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
