(1) In general

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with the directors of such bank, the International Development Association, and the International Finance Corporation and propose that such institutions provide advice and assistance, as appropriate, to borrowing country governments desiring to facilitate debt-for-development swaps, on mechanisms (including trust funds) to accomplish this purpose, particularly in the context of debt rescheduling, which mechanisms result in sound management of the macroeconomic impact of such swaps on such countries, and preserve the value of the capital obtained through such swaps.
