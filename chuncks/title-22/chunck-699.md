#### § 286jj. Partial guarantees in connection with debt reduction for borrower countries

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to propose that such bank establish criteria under which such bank would provide partial guarantees on debt service payments by borrower countries to private creditors when such guarantees would serve a catalytic role in facilitating final agreement on financing packages which involve significant debt reduction.
