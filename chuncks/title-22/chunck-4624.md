If the Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under subsection (f) that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the Department or labor organization an order

(1) to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the Department or labor organization is engaged;

(2) requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Board and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given retroactive effect;

(3) requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay in accordance with section 5596 of title 5 ; or

(4) including any combination of the actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3) or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this subchapter. If any such order requires reinstatement of an employee with backpay, backpay may be required of the Department (as provided in section 5596 of title 5 ) or of the labor organization, as the case may be, which is found to have engaged in the unfair labor practice involved.
