#### § 2311. General authority
##### (b) Terms and conditions

In addition to such other terms and conditions as the President may determine pursuant to subsection (a), defense articles may be loaned thereunder only if

(1) there is a bona fide reason, other than the shortage of funds, for providing such articles on a loan basis rather than on a grant basis;

(2) there is a reasonable expectation that such articles will be returned to the agency making the loan at the end of the loan period, unless the loan is then renewed;

(3) the loan period is of fixed duration not exceeding five years, during which such article may be recalled for any reason by the United States;

(4) the agency making the loan is reimbursed for the loan based on the amount charged to the appropriation for military assistance under subsection (c); and

(5) the loan agreement provides that (A) if the defense article is damaged while on loan, the country or international organization to which it was loaned will reimburse the United States for the cost of restoring or replacing the defense article, and (B) if the defense article is lost or destroyed while on loan, the country or international organization to which it was loaned will pay to the United States an amount equal to the replacement cost (less any depreciation in the value) of the defense article.
