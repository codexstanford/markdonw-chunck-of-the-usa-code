#### § 2293. Long-term development assistance for sub-Saharan Africa
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds that

(1) drought and famine have caused countless deaths and untold suffering among the people of sub-Saharan Africa;

(2) drought and famine in combination with other factors such as desertification, government neglect of the agricultural sector, and inappropriate economic policies have severely affected long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa; and

(3) the most cost-effective and efficient way of overcoming Africa’s vulnerability to drought and famine is to address Africa’s long-term development needs through a process that builds upon the needs and capabilities of the African people, promotes sustained and equitable economic growth, preserves the environment, and protects the rights of the individual.
