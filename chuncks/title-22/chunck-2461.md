### CHAPTER 32— FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
#### § 2370. Prohibitions against furnishing assistance
##### (d) Productive enterprises competing with United States enterprise; conditions on assistance; import controls; waiver of restriction by President

No assistance shall be furnished on a loan basis under part I of subchapter I of this chapter for construction or operation of any productive enterprise in any country where such enterprise will compete with United States enterprise unless such country has agreed that it will establish appropriate procedures to prevent the exportation for use or consumption in the United States of more than twenty per centum of the annual production of such facility during the life of the loan. In case of failure to implement such agreement by the other contracting party, the President is authorized to establish necessary import controls to effectuate the agreement. The restrictions imposed by or pursuant to this subsection may be waived by the President where he determines that such waiver is in the national security interest.
