### CHAPTER 52— FOREIGN SERVICE
#### § 4054. Former spouses
##### (b) Deceased Service members

(1) Subject to any election under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title , if a former participant who is entitled to receive an annuity is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled to a survivor annuity

(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant’s annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title ; or

(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse’s pro rata share of 55 percent of the full amount of such annuity. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “creditable service” means service which is creditable under part I or II.

(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.

(3) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.

(4)

(A) The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under this section (and section 4046(b)(3) of this title ) with respect to any participant or former participant may not exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant’s annuity, as calculated under section 4046(a) of this title .

(B) Once a survivor annuity has been provided for under this subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity may thereafter be provided for under this subsection (or section 4046(b)(3) of this title ) with respect to a participant or former participant only for that portion (if any) of the maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.

(C) After the death of a participant or former participant, a court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of any former spouse under this section.

(5)

(A) For each full month after a former spouse of a participant or former participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60, the annuity of the participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).

(B) Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 4046(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.
