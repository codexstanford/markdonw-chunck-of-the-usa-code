#### § 2803. Federal participation
##### (b) Construction of Federal pavilion

(1) In developing a plan under subsection (a)(3) of this section the Secretary of Commerce shall consider whether the plan should include the construction of a Federal pavilion. If the Secretary of Commerce determines that a Federal pavilion should be constructed, he shall request the Administrator of General Services (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “Administrator”) to determine, in consultation with such Secretary, whether there is a federally endorsed need for a permanent structure in the area of the exposition. If the Administrator determines that any such need exists

(A) the Administrator shall fully document such determination, including the identification of the need, and shall transmit such documentation to the Secretary of Commerce;

(B) the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Administrator, shall design a pavilion which satisfies the federally endorsed needs for

(i) participation in the exposition; and

(ii) permanent use of such pavilion after the termination of participation in the exposition; and

(C) the Secretary of Commerce shall determine whether the Federal Government should be deeded a satisfactory site for the Federal pavilion in fee simple, free of all liens and encumbrances, as a condition of participation in the exposition.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Administrator determines that no design of a Federal pavilion will satisfy both needs described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall design a temporary Federal pavilion.
