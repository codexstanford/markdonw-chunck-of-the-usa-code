(3) Mitigating factor

Where applicable, the head of an executive agency may consider whether the contractor or grantee had a plan in place under section 7104a of this title , and was in compliance with that plan at the time of the violation, as a mitigating factor in determining which remedies, if any, should apply.

(4) Aggravating factor

Where applicable, the head of an executive agency may consider the failure of a contractor or grantee to abate an alleged violation or enforce the requirements of a compliance plan when directed by a contracting officer pursuant to subsection (a)(1) as an aggravating factor in determining which remedies, if any, should apply.
