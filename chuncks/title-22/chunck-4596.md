If a petition is filed with the Board

(1) by any person alleging

(A) in the case of a unit for which there is no exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative, or

(B) in the case of a unit for which there is an exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit alleged that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit; or

(2) by any person seeking clarification of, or an amendment to, a certification then in effect or a matter relating to representation; the Board shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after reasonable notice. If the Board finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Board shall supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof. An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any unit within which a valid election under this subsection has been held during the preceding 12 calendar months or with respect to which a labor organization has been certified as the exclusive representative during the preceding 24 calendar months.
