#### § 4046. Computation of annuities
##### (g) Marriage after retirement

A participant or former participant who was unmarried at retirement and who later marries may, within one year after such marriage, irrevocably elect in writing to receive a reduced annuity and to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse (if such spouse qualifies as a surviving spouse under section 4044(13) of this title ). Receipt by the Secretary of State of notice of an election under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made under subsection (f). The reduction in annuity required by an election under this subsection shall be computed and the amount of the survivor annuity shall be determined in accordance with subsections (b)(2) and (3). The annuity reduction or recomputation shall be effective the first day of the month beginning one year after the date of marriage.
