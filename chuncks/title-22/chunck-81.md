#### § 262l–1. Sustainable economic growth and management of natural resources; environmental impact of loans; pest management; addition of trained professionals; “early warning system”
##### (h) Operation of “early warning system”

The Administrator of the Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Secretaries of Treasury and State, shall continue, and work to enhance, the operation of the “early warning system”, by

(1) instructing overseas missions of the Agency for International Development and embassies of the United States to analyze the impacts of Multilateral Development Bank loans well in advance of a loan’s approval. Such reviews shall address the economic viability of the project; adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, public health, and indigenous peoples; and recommendations as to measures, including alternatives, that could eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts. If not classified under the national security system of classification, such information shall be made available to the public;

(2) compiling a list of proposed Multilateral Development Bank loans likely to have adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, public health, or indigenous peoples. The list shall contain the information identified in paragraph (1), shall be updated in consultation with interested members of the public, and shall be made available to the Committees on Appropriations by April 1, 1988 and semiannually thereafter; and

(3) creating a cooperative mechanism for sharing information collected through the “early warning system” with interested donor and borrowing nations and encouraging the Multilateral Development Banks to institute a similar system.
