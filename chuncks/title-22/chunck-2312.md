#### § 2344. Reimbursements
##### (a) Separate fund account; transfers to such account

Whenever funds made available for use under subchapter II of this chapter have been or are used to furnish military assistance on cash or credit terms, United States dollar repayments, including dollar proceeds derived from the sale of foreign currency repayments to any agency or program of the United States Government, receipts received from the disposition of evidences of indebtedness and charges (including fees and premiums) or interest collected shall be credited to a separate fund account, and shall be available until expended solely for the purpose of financing sales and guaranties, including the overhead costs thereof, and, notwithstanding any provision of law relating to receipts and credits accruing to the United States Government, repayments in foreign currency may be used to carry out subchapter II of this chapter. Such amounts of the appropriations made available under subchapter II of this chapter (including unliquidated balances of funds heretofore obligated for financing sales and guarantees) as may be determined by the President shall be transferred to, and merged with, the separate fund account.
