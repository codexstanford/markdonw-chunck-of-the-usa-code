(2) That support for such an authority should come from industrialized countries, and that greater support should be expected from countries with strong current account surpluses.

(3) That such an authority should have a clearly defined close working relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the various regional development banks.

(5) That such an authority should have a defined termination date and a clear proposal for the restoration of creditworthiness to debtor countries within this timeframe.
