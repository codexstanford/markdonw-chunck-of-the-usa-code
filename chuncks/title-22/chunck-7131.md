#### § 9621. Authorities relating to provision of support
##### (c) Equity investments

(1) In general

The Corporation may, as a minority investor, support projects with funds or use other mechanisms for the purpose of purchasing, and may make and fund commitments to purchase, invest in, make pledges in respect of, or otherwise acquire, equity or quasi-equity securities or shares or financial interests of any entity, including as a limited partner or other investor in investment funds, upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine.

(2) Denomination

Support provided under paragraph (1) may be denominated and repayable in United States dollars or foreign currency. Foreign currency denominated support provided by paragraph (1) should only be provided if the Board determines there is a substantive policy rationale for such support.

(3) Guidelines and criteria

The Corporation shall develop guidelines and criteria to require that the use of the authority provided by paragraph (1) with respect to a project has a clearly defined development and foreign policy purpose, taking into account the following objectives:

(A) The support for the project would be more likely than not to substantially reduce or overcome the effect of an identified market failure in the country in which the project is carried out.

(B) The project would not have proceeded or would have been substantially delayed without the support.

(C) The support would meaningfully contribute to transforming local conditions to promote the development of markets.

(D) The support can be shown to be aligned with commercial partner incentives.

(E) The support can be shown to have significant developmental impact and will contribute to long-term commercial sustainability.

(F) The support furthers the policy of the United States described in section 9611 of this title .

(4) Limitations on equity investments

(A) Per project limit

The aggregate amount of support provided under this subsection with respect to any project shall not exceed 30 percent of the aggregate amount of all equity investment made to the project at the time that the Corporation approves support of the project.

(B) Total limit

Support provided pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to not more than 35 percent of the Corporation’s aggregate exposure on the date that such support is provided.

(5) Sales and liquidation of position

The Corporation shall seek to sell and liquidate any support for a project provided under this subsection as soon as commercially feasible, commensurate with other similar investors in the project and taking into consideration the national security interests of the United States.

(6) Timetable

The Corporation shall create a project-specific timetable for support provided under paragraph (1).
