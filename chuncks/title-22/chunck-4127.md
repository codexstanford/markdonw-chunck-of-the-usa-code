#### § 3792. Bases of tolls
##### (a) Tolls based on net vessel tons and on displacement tonnage

Tolls on merchant vessels, army and navy transports, colliers, tankers, hospital ships, and supply ships shall be based on net vessel tons of one hundred cubic feet each of actual earning capacity, or its equivalent, determined in accordance with the rules for the measurement of vessels for the Panama Canal, and tolls on other floating craft shall be based on displacement tonnage. The tolls on vessels in ballast without passengers or cargo may be less than the tolls for vessels with passengers or cargo. Tolls for small vessels (including yachts), as defined by the Commission, may be set at rates determined by the Commission without regard to the preceding provisions of this subsection.
