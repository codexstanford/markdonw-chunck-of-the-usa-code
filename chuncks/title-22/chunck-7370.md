#### § 10224. Support for greater United Nations action with respect to Burma
##### (c) Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations should use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to

(1) object to the appointment of representatives to the United Nations and United Nations bodies such as the Human Rights Council that are sanctioned by the Burmese military; and

(2) work to ensure the Burmese military is not recognized as the legitimate government of Burma in any United Nations body.
