### CHAPTER 4— PASSPORTS
#### § 212b. Unique passport identifiers for covered sex offenders
##### (b) Authority to use unique passport identifiers

(1) In general

Except as provided under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State shall not issue a passport to a covered sex offender unless the passport contains a unique identifier, and may revoke a passport previously issued without such an identifier of a covered sex offender.

(2) Authority to reissue

Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary of State may reissue a passport that does not include a unique identifier if an individual described in subsection (a) reapplies for a passport and the Angel Watch Center provides a written determination, through the process developed for that purpose under section 21507 of title 34 , to the Secretary of State that the individual is no longer required to register as a covered sex offender.

(3) Clarification with respect to continuing registration

An individual may not be issued or reissued a passport without a unique identifier solely because the individual has moved or otherwise resides outside the United States.
