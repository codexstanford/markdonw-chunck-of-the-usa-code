#### § 4054. Former spouses
##### (c) Additional survivor annuity
######## (C) If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries before attaining age 60 (or, in the case of a spouse, the spouse does not qualify as a former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage)

(i) if an annuity reduction or salary allotment under subparagraph (A) is in effect for that spouse or former spouse, the annuity shall be recomputed and paid as if it had not been reduced or the salary allotment terminated, as the case may be, and

(ii) any amount accruing to the Fund under subparagraph (A) shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits under this subsection for the period such benefits were provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.

(D) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State, an annuity shall be recomputed (or salary allotment terminated or adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60 and an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance with this part.

(4) An annuity payable under this subsection to a spouse or former spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse’s death or remarriage before attaining age 60.

(5) Section 4066 of this title shall not apply to any annuity under this subsection, unless authorized under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.
