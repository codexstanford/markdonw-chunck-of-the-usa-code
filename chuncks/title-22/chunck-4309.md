### CHAPTER 52— FOREIGN SERVICE
#### § 4007. Retirement for expiration of time in class
##### (a) Maximum time

(1) The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish maximum time in class limitations for

(A) career members of the Senior Foreign Service,

(B) Foreign Service officers, and

(C) other career members of the Service who are in such occupational categories as may be designated by the Secretary and who are assigned to salary classes in the Foreign Service Schedule to which Foreign Service officers may also be assigned.

(2) Maximum time in class limitations under this subsection (which may not be less than 3 years for career members of the Senior Foreign Service) may apply with respect to the time a member may remain in a single salary class or in a combination of salary classes.

(3) The Secretary may, by regulation, increase or decrease any maximum time in class established under this subsection as the needs of the Service may require. If maximum time in class is decreased, the Secretary shall provide any member of the Service who is in a category and salary class subject to the new time in class limitation an opportunity to remain in class (notwithstanding the new limitation) for a period which is at least as long as the shorter of

(A) the period which the member would have been permitted to remain in class but for the decrease in maximum time in class, or

(B) such minimum period as the Secretary determines is necessary to provide members of the Service who are in the same category and salary class as that member a reasonable opportunity to be promoted into the next higher class or combination of classes, as the case may be.
