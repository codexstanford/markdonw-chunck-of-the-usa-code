##### (b) Technical assistance to transform government-owned enterprises into privately owned enterprises

In order to assist and strengthen the advancement of ongoing efforts to have the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development play a key role in building a viable private sector in member borrowing countries of such bank, and to further assist such bank in its determination to facilitate the transfer of government-owned enterprises in such countries to private ownership, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of such bank to vigorously encourage the provision of technical assistance to such countries (relying, where appropriate, on the expertise of the International Finance Corporation or the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) to transform enterprises owned, in whole or part, by the governments of such countries into privately owned, self-sufficient enterprises. Such technical assistance may involve the valuation of the assets of such government-owned enterprises, the assessment of tender offers, and the creation or strengthening of market-based mechanisms to facilitate such a transfer of ownership.
