### CHAPTER 52— FOREIGN SERVICE
#### § 4054. Former spouses
##### (a) Living Service members

(1) Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title , a former spouse of a participant or former participant is entitled to an annuity if such former spouse was married to the participant for at least 10 years during service of the participant which is creditable under this subchapter with at least 5 of such years occurring while the participant was a member of the Foreign Service and

(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or

(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse’s pro rata share of 50 percent of such annuity. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “creditable service” means service which is creditable under part I or II.

(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.

(3) The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the later of the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this part or the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final. The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on

(A) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or

(B) the date the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).

(4) No spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title involving any participant may provide for an annuity or any combination of annuities under this subsection which exceeds the annuity of the participant, nor may any such court order relating to an annuity under this subsection be given effect if it is issued more than 24 months after the date the divorce or annulment involved becomes final.

(5)

(A) The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this part, and in calculating any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) or section 4046(b)(3) of this title .

(B) If any annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 3948 of this title , or reinstated or reappointed in the Service in the case of a recovered disability annuitant or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under section 4064 of this title , the salary of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.

(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant

(A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date the participant would qualify on the basis of his or her creditable service for an annuity under this part (other than a disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and

(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.

(7) An annuity under this subsection shall be treated the same as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) for purposes of section 4046(h) of this title or any comparable provision of law.
