##### (c) Monitoring and evaluation

Any grantee shall

(1) develop specific and detailed criteria for the monitoring and evaluation of supported projects;

(2) implement a system for measuring progress against baseline data that is rigorously designed based on international corporate and nongovernmental best practices;

(3) ensure that each supported project is regularly and rigorously monitored and evaluated, on a not less than biennial basis, by an independent monitoring and evaluation entity, against the specific and detailed criteria established pursuant to paragraph (1), and that the progress of the project towards its stated goals is measured by such entity against baseline data;

(4) support the development of a scientifically sound, representative survey methodology for measuring prevalence with reference to existing research and experience, and apply the methodology consistently to determine the baseline prevalence in target populations and outcomes in order to periodically assess progress in reducing prevalence; and

(5) establish, and revise on a not less than annual basis, specific and detailed criteria for the suspension and termination, as appropriate, of projects supported by the grantee that regularly or consistently fail to meet the criteria required by this section.
