### CHAPTER 52— FOREIGN SERVICE
#### § 4156. Preservation of status and benefits
##### (a) Conversion to class, grade, or step corresponding to level prior to conversion; reduction in position or salary; conversion from Foreign Service under section 4154 of this title

(1) Every individual who is converted under this subchapter shall be converted to the class or grade and pay rate that most closely corresponds to the class or grade and step at which the individual was serving immediately before conversion. No conversion under this subchapter shall cause any individual to incur a reduction in his or her class, grade, or basic rate of salary.

(2) An individual converted under section 4154 of this title to a position in the competitive service shall be entitled to have that position, or any other position to which the individual is subsequently assigned (other than at the request of the individual), be considered for all purposes as at the grade which corresponds to the class in which the individual served immediately before conversion so long as the individual continues to hold that position.
