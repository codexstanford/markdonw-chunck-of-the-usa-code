#### § 4156. Preservation of status and benefits
##### (b) Participation in Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System

(1) Any participant in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System who would, but for this paragraph, participate in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System by virtue of conversion under this subchapter shall remain a participant in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System for 120 days after participation in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System would otherwise cease.

If such an election is not made, the individual shall then be covered by the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System and contributions made by the participant to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund shall be transferred to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

(2) Any Foreign Service Reserve officer with limited tenure who has reemployment rights to a personnel category in the Foreign Service in which he or she would be a participant in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System and who would, but for this paragraph, continue to participate in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System by virtue of conversion under section 4154 of this title may elect, during the 120-day period beginning on the date of such conversion, to become a participant in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System so long as he or she is employed in an agency which is authorized to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system. If such an election is made, the individual shall be transferred to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System and contributions made by that individual to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund shall be transferred to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
