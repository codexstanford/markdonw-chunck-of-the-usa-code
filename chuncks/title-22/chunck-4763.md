##### (a) Proposed acquisition, sale, or other disposition

(1) The Secretary shall require any foreign mission, including any mission to an international organization (as defined in section 4309(b)(2) of this title ), to notify the Secretary prior to any proposed acquisition, or any proposed sale or other disposition, of any real property by or on behalf of such mission. The foreign mission (or other party acting on behalf of the foreign mission) may initiate or execute any contract, proceeding, application, or other action required for the proposed action
