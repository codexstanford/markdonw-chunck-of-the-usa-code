(E) a listing of each audit report completed by the Inspector General during the reporting period; and

(F) a notification, which may be included, if necessary, in the classified portion of the report, of any instance in a case that was closed during the period covered by the report when the Inspector General decided not to afford an individual the opportunity described in subsection (c)(5)(B)(i) to refute any allegation and the rationale for denying such individual that opportunity. The Secretary of State shall transmit a copy of such annual report within 30 days after receiving it to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and to other appropriate committees, together with a report of the Secretary of State containing any comments which the Secretary of State deems appropriate.

The Secretary of State shall transmit any such report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and to other appropriate committees within 7 days after receiving it, together with a report by the Secretary of State containing any comments the Secretary of State deems appropriate.

(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the public disclosure by any individual of any information which is

(A) specifically prohibited from disclosure by any other provision of law; or
