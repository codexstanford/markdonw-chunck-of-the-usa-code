#### § 2428b. Special security assistance for modernization of Armed Forces of Korea
##### (b) Additional transfer authority of President of defense articles located outside of Korea; prerequisites for determinations respecting transfers; report by President to Congress of determinations

In order that transfers of defense articles under subsection (a) will not cause significant adverse impact on the readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States, the President is authorized, in lieu of such transfers, to transfer additional defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense, wherever located, to the Republic of Korea to compensate for the military capability of defense articles withdrawn from Korea in any case where he determines that

(1) the transfer of specific defense articles located in Korea would have a significant adverse impact on the readiness of the United States Armed Forces;

(2) the defense capability provided by those defense articles is needed by the Armed Forces of the Republic of Korea in order to maintain the military balance on the Korean peninsula; and

(3) a comparable defense capability could be provided by less advanced defense articles in the stocks of the Department of Defense which could be transferred without significant adverse impact on the readiness of the United States Armed Forces. The President shall report to the Congress each determination made under this subsection prior to the transfer of the defense articles described in such determination.
