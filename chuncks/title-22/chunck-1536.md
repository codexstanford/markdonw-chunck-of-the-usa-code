#### § 1650a. Arbitration awards under the Convention
##### (a) Treaty rights; enforcement; full faith and credit; nonapplication of Federal Arbitration Act

An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration Act ( 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the convention.
