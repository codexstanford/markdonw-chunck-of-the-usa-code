##### (c) Excess property

(1) Except as provided in subsection (d), no Government-owned excess property shall be made available under this section, section 2358 of this title , or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of subchapter I of this chapter, unless, before the shipment of such property for use in a specified country (or transfer, if the property is already in such country), the agency administering such subchapter I has approved such shipment (or transfer) and made a written determination

(A) that there is a need for such property in the quantity requested and that such property is suitable for the purpose requested;

(B) as to the status and responsibility of the designated end-user and his ability effectively to use and maintain such property; and

(C) that the residual value, serviceability, and appearance of such property would not reflect unfavorably on the image of the United States and would justify the costs of packing, crating, handling, transportation, and other accessorial costs, and that the residual value at least equals the total of these costs.
