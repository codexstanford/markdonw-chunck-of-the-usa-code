### CHAPTER 32— FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
#### § 2312. Authorization of appropriations
##### (b) Programing and budgeting procedures

In order to make sure that a dollar spent on military assistance to foreign countries is as necessary as a dollar spent for the United States military establishment, the President shall establish procedures for programing and budgeting so that programs of military assistance come into direct competition for financial support with other activities and programs of the Department of Defense.
