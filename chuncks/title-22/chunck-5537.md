#### § 6208a. Open Technology Fund
##### (c) Methodology

In carrying out subsection (b), the Open Technology Fund shall

(1) support fully open-source tools, code, and components, to the extent practicable, to ensure such supported tools and technologies are as secure, transparent, and accessible as possible, and require that any such tools, components, code, or technology supported by the Open Technology Fund remain fully open-source, to the extent practicable;

(2) support technologies that undergo comprehensive security audits to ensure that such technologies are secure and have not been compromised in a manner detrimental to the interest of the United States or to individuals and organizations benefitting from programs supported by the Open Technology Fund;

(3) review and update periodically as necessary security auditing procedures used by the Open Technology Fund to reflect current industry security standards;

(4) establish safeguards to mitigate the use of such supported technologies for illicit purposes;

(5) solicit project proposals through an open, transparent, and competitive application process to attract innovative applications and reduce barriers to entry;

(6) seek input from technical, regional, and subject matter experts from a wide range of relevant disciplines, to review, provide feedback, and evaluate proposals to ensure the most competitive projects are funded;

(7) implement an independent review process, through which proposals are reviewed by such experts to ensure the highest degree of technical review and due diligence;

(8) maximize cooperation with the public and private sectors, as well as foreign allies and partner countries, to maximize efficiencies and eliminate duplication of efforts; and

(9) utilize any other methodology approved by the United States Agency for Global Media in furtherance of the mission of the Open Technology Fund.
