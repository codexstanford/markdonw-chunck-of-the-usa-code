#### § 2293. Long-term development assistance for sub-Saharan Africa
##### (i) Critical sectoral priorities

The critical sectoral priorities for long-term development, as described in subsection (c), are the following:

(1) Agricultural production and natural resources

(A) Agricultural production

Increasing agricultural production in ways which protect and restore the natural resource base, especially food production, through agricultural policy changes, agricultural research (including participatory research directly involving small farmers) and extension, development and promotion of agriculture marketing activities, credit facilities, and appropriate production packages, and the construction and improvement of needed production-related infrastructure such as farm-to-market roads, small-scale irrigation, and rural electrification. Within this process, emphasis shall be given to promoting increased equity in rural income distribution, recognizing the role of small farmers.

(B) Natural resource base

Maintaining and restoring the renewable natural resource base primarily in ways which increase agricultural production, through the following:

(i) Small-scale, affordable, resource-conserving, low-risk local projects, using appropriate technologies (including traditional agricultural methods) suited to local environmental, resource, and climatic conditions, and featuring close consultation with and involvement of local people at all stages of project design and implementation. Emphasis shall be given to grants for African local government organizations, international or African nongovernmental organizations, and United States private and voluntary organizations.

(ii) Support for efforts at national and regional levels to provide technical and other support for projects of the kinds described in clause (i) and to strengthen the capacities of African countries to provide effective extension and other services in support of environmentally sustainable increases in food production.

(iii) Support for special training and education efforts to improve the capacity of countries in sub-Saharan Africa to manage their own environments and natural resources.

(iv) Support for low-cost desalination activities in order to increase the availability of fresh water sources in sub-Saharan Africa.

(2) Health

Improving health conditions, with special emphasis on meeting the health needs of mothers and children (including displaced children) through the establishment of primary health care systems that give priority to preventive health and that will be ultimately self-sustaining. In addition, providing training and training facilities, in sub-Saharan Africa, for doctors and other health care providers, notwithstanding any provision of law that restricts assistance to foreign countries.

(3) Voluntary family planning services

Providing increased access to voluntary family planning services, including encouragement of private, community, and local government initiatives.

(4) Education

Improving the relevance, equity, and efficiency of education, with special emphasis on improving primary education.

(5) Income-generating opportunities

Developing income-generating opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in urban and rural areas through, among other things, support for off-farm employment opportunities in micro- and small-scale labor-intensive enterprises.
