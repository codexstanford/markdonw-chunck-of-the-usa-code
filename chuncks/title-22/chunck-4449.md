### CHAPTER 52— FOREIGN SERVICE
#### § 4060. Assignment and attachment of moneys
##### (b) Participants or annuitants having former spouses
######## (B) This paragraph shall not apply in the case of any spousal agreement or court order which, as determined by the Secretary of State

(i) would provide for a survivor annuity for a spouse or any former spouse of a participant with respect to which there has not been an annuity reduction (or a salary reduction or payment under section 4054(c)(3) of this title ); or

(ii) is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of this part.

(2) Except with respect to obligations between participants and former spouses, payments under this part which would otherwise be made to a participant or annuitant based upon his or her service shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Secretary of State to another individual to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any order or any court decree of legal separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of legal separation.

(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply only to payments made under this part for periods beginning after the date of receipt by the Secretary of State of written notice of such decree, order, or agreement, and such additional information and such documentation as the Secretary of State may require.

(4) Any payment under this subsection to an individual bars recovery by any other individual.

(5) The 10-year requirement of section 4044(b)(6) of this title , or any other provision of this part, shall not be construed to affect the rights any spouse or individual formerly married to a participant or annuitant may have, under any law or rule of law of any State or the District of Columbia, with respect to an annuity of a participant or annuitant under this part.
