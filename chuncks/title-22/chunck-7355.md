(2) support the efforts of the National Unity Government (NUG), the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC), the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), the Burmese Civil Disobedience Movement, and other entities in Burma and in other countries to oppose the Burmese military and bring about an end to the military junta’s rule;

(3) support a credible process for the restoration of civilian government in Burma, with a reformed Burmese military under civilian control and the enactment of constitutional, political, and economic reform that protects the rights of minority groups and furthers a federalist form of government;

(7) secure the unconditional release of all unlawfully detained individuals in Burma, including those detained for the exercise of their fundamental freedoms; and

(8) provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma in Burma, Bangladesh, Thailand, and the surrounding region without going through the Burmese military.
