#### § 262k. Financial assistance to international financial institutions; considerations and criteria
##### (c) Project proposals relating to mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products

More specifically, the following criteria should be considered as a basis for a vote by the respective United States Executive Director to each of the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) against a project proposal involving the creation of new capacity or the expansion, improvement, or modification of mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products:

(1) Analysis shows that the risks, returns, and incentives of a project are such that it could be financed at reasonable terms by commercial lending services.

(2) Analysis by the United States Bureau of Mines indicates that surplus capacity in the industry for the primary product of the defined project would exist over half the period of the economic life of the project because of projected world demand and capacity conditions.

(3) United States imports of the commodity constitute less than 50 percent of the domestic production of the primary product in those cases where the United States is the substantial producer of such commodities.
