#### § 10224. Support for greater United Nations action with respect to Burma
##### (b) Support for greater action

The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to spur greater action by the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council with respect to Burma by

(1) pushing the United Nations Security Council to consider a resolution condemning the February 1, 2021 , coup and calling on the Burmese military to cease its violence against the people of Burma and release without preconditions the journalists, pro-democracy activists, and political officials that it has unjustly detained;

(2) pushing the United Nations Security Council to consider a resolution that immediately imposes a global arms embargo against Burma to ensure that the Burmese military is not able to obtain weapons and munitions from other nations to further harm, murder, and oppress the people of Burma;

(3) pushing the United Nations and other United Nations authorities to cut off assistance to the Government of Burma while providing humanitarian assistance directly to the people of Burma through United Nations bodies and civil society organizations, particularly such organizations working with ethnic minorities that have been adversely affected by the coup and the Burmese military’s violent crackdown; and

(4) spurring the United Nations Security Council to consider multilateral sanctions against the Burmese military for its atrocities against Rohingya and individuals of other ethnic and religious minorities, its coup, and the atrocities it has and continues to commit in the coup’s aftermath.
