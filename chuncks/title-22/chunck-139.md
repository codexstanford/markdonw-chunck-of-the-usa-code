#### § 262p–1. Grassroots Collaboration Program
##### (a) Proposal for establishment; private involvement; projects or policies for alleviation of poverty and promotion of environmental protection

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association to initiate discussions with other directors of such institutions and to propose the establishment of a Grassroots Collaboration Program to develop improved mechanisms for involving, directly or indirectly, nongovernmental organizations in the design, implementation, and monitoring of development projects financed by, or development policies established by, such bank or association in order to alleviate poverty and promote environmental protection, including

(1) encouraging nongovernmental organizations in borrowing countries to participate in all stages of project planning and country strategy activities to

(A) minimize any adverse impact of such projects or activities on the poor people of such country;

(B) minimize any adverse impact of such projects or activities on the environment of such country; and

(C) maximize the extent to which such projects or activities will benefit the poor people of such country;

(2) increasing the direct involvement of nongovernmental organizations in project design, implementation, or monitoring whenever such organizations have a distinct comparative advantage over other entities in providing such services by virtue of their grassroots involvement with poor people, especially women, in a borrowing country;

(3) providing microenterprise credit for small scale economic activities through nongovernmental organizations;

(4) supporting the enhancement of the institutional capacity of nongovernmental organizations in borrowing countries as development practitioners; and
