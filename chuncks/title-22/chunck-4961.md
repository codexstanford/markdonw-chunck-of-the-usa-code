### CHAPTER 58— DIPLOMATIC SECURITY
#### § 4801. Findings and purposes
##### (a) Findings

The Congress finds and declares that

(1) the United States has a crucial stake in the presence of United States Government personnel representing United States interests abroad;

(2) conditions confronting United States Government personnel and missions abroad are fraught with security concerns which will continue for the foreseeable future; and

(3) the resources now available to counter acts of terrorism and protect and secure United States Government personnel and missions abroad, as well as foreign officials and missions in the United States, are inadequate to meet the mounting threat to such personnel and facilities.
