#### § 2703. Services and facilities for employees at posts abroad
##### (e) Child care facilities

The Secretary of State may make grants to child care facilities, to offset in part the cost of such care, in Moscow and at no more than five other posts abroad where the Secretary determines that due to extraordinary circumstances such facilities are necessary to the efficient operation of the post. In making that determination, the Secretary shall take into account factors such as

(1) whether Foreign Service spouses are encouraged to work at the post because

(A) the number of members of the post is subject to a ceiling imposed by the receiving country; and

(B) Foreign Service nationals are not employed at the post; and

(2) whether local child care is available.
